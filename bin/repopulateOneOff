Since it was established in part to \"apply the principles of Art to the requirements of trade and manufacture,\" the prescient founders chose to incorporate the word \"design\" into the name of the school as a means of signaling its importance to economic development. But they also clearly stipulated that their educational experiment aimed both to teach students \"the practice of Art, in order that they may understand its principles, give instruction to others, or become artists\" and to educate the general public about the intrinsic value of the arts to society.\n</p>",

Completion of a studio major demands intense hands-on making and a high level of craftsmanship, but to ground studio work in a larger cultural context, students also complete a third of the credits required for graduation in such liberal arts areas as art history, visual culture, English, philosophy and the social sciences.\n</p>",

As one of the first colleges of its kind in the country – founded simultaneously with the RISD Museum of Art – it has always been something of a maverick.\n</p>\n<p>\n\tRISD was founded and nurtured by women – more than 40 years before women in America even gained the right to vote. In 1877, the 34 members of the Rhode Island Women's Centennial Commission voted to invest their group's surplus funding of $1,675 in founding Rhode Island School of Design. In doing so, they not only embarked on a radical experiment, but set the school's tone for challenging assumptions that continues to this day.<sub></sub>\n</p>",

From 1912 through the late 1920s, he spent summers on Cape Cod, MA at Charles W.

At RISD he served as head of the Painting department and chair of Fine Arts until he was appointed president in 1955 (initially on an interim basis), a position he held until his retirement in 1962. During his tenure, Frazier instituted collegial ranks for faculty, began the movement towards a tenure system and established a system of governance based on administrative and faculty committees. He oversaw Design for a Decade, a capital campaign to fund the construction of the Waterman Street dorms (now known as the Quad) and the Metcalf Refectory (The Met) in 1959.
