&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Talking Tools&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-23&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Talking Tools&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>
    <HMTL>&lt;newsItem&gt;&lt;thumbimage&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-listing-1.jpg&lt;/thumbimage&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>
    <HMTL>&lt;newsItem&gt;&lt;thumbimage&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-listing-1.jpg&lt;/thumbimage&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RS-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;

When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today.

&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover speaks at RISD on January 30. // photo by Victoria Will / Invision / AP&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Design Up Close</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>
    <HMTL>&lt;newsItem&gt;&lt;thumbimage&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethListingHeadshot.jpg&lt;/thumbimage&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-04&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/glover-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country.

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-04&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/glover-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>15-honorary degrees</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-04&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/glover-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-23&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/biennial-horizontal-740.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Micah Barrett 12 GD, who teaches in Graphic Design, created this colorful mix and match poster to promote the show.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/ACEDetailBest.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Talking Tools&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-23&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/biennial-horizontal-740.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Micah Barrett 12 GD, who teaches in Graphic Design, created this colorful mix and match poster to promote the show.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/ACEDetailBest.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-23&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/biennial-horizontal-740.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Micah Barrett 12 GD, who teaches in Graphic Design, created this colorful mix and match poster to promote the show.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/ACEDetailBest.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers.

He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create.

&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support.

In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media.

&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rosanne Somerson Named 17th President&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-18&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Furniture designer, educator and former provost Rosanne Somerson is the first alumna to lead RISD. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four decades after she first came to RISD, accomplished furniture designer and educator &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/span&gt;has become RISD’s top leader, accepting the position of president effective immediately. Her appointment comes after an extensive international search during which she has ably served as interim president since January 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rosanne Somerson is a gifted, inspiring and dedicated leader, and is the perfect fit for RISD,” notes Board of Trustees Chair &lt;strong&gt;Michael Spalter&lt;/strong&gt;, who appointed a search committee of 11 members of the RISD community to lead the effort to identify the most appropriate new president. “Her experiences as a RISD student, faculty member, department head, provost and interim president provide a depth of knowledge and almost instinctive understanding of the institution that no other candidate could match. She has also demonstrated the collaborative leadership style and informed vision RISD needs to expand its role in advancing global innovation in the 21st century.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somerson's deep roots at RISD – which extend back to 1972 when she first came to campus as a freshman – have, indeed, served her well in transitioning through successively more demanding teaching and academic leadership responsibilities. Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

Last winter she provided an almost seamless transition when she moved from her role as provost to interim president within weeks of former President John Maeda’s announcement that he was leaving for a new position in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Somerson has gone on to guide RISD with confidence, focusing on advancing academic excellence, maximizing the efficacy of current operations and planning for emerging challenges and opportunities for higher education. She has championed continued work on a campus master plan, which has already led to significant upgrades in academic studios and classrooms, student housing and administrative spaces, and has also shown the ability for fundraising needed by most college presidents in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as she drops the word “interim” from her title, President Somerson says, “I am honored to lead this institution, to build on its strong 138-year legacy and advance ambitious plans for facilities, programs and global partnerships.” She adds that RISD’s “extraordinary community of faculty scholars and practitioners, students and alumni is making a positive impact in the world every day. I know firsthand the value of an art and design education, and am confident that RISD’s model of immersive, studio-based learning has greater global impact and is more important and vital than ever.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-04&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/glover-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/ACEDetailBest.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE.

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me.

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Art Educator of the Year</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Art Educator of the Year&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-26&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/silverman-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stephanie Silverman 04 FD is being honored at the 2015 NAEA convention in New Orleans.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephanie (Welch) Silverman 04 FD&lt;/strong&gt; first recognized her interest in teaching when she was at RISD and working as a TA for Professor &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/John-Dunnigan/" title="John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID" target="_blank"&gt;John Dunnigan MFA 80 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Showing a natural gift in the classroom, she earned the Furniture Design department's Tage Frid Award for Excellence in Teaching as she was graduating. President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu/bio" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was department head at the time, remembers Silverman’s excitement at receiving the award, which makes this week’s new honor at the &lt;a href="http://www.arteducators.org/news/national-convention/national-convention" title="National Art Education Association" target="_blank"&gt;National Art Education Association&lt;/a&gt;’s annual convention in New Orleans that much more special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Somerson is a featured speaker at the conference, Silverman is accepting the NAEA’s 2015 award for Eastern Region Secondary Art Educator of the Year – meaning she’s being recognized as the best high school art teacher in a region stretching from Washington, DC north to Newfoundland and Ontario. “Stephanie Silverman exemplifies the highly qualified art educators active in education today: leaders, teachers, students, scholars and advocates who give their best to their students and the profession,” notes NAEA President &lt;strong&gt;Dennis Inhulsen&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am truly humbled to receive this important distinction,” Silverman says, “but I share the honor with my students at &lt;a href="http://www.tatnall.org/" title="The Tatnall School" target="_blank"&gt;The Tatnall School&lt;/a&gt; in Wilmington, DE. After all, effective teaching is truly a synergy – a kind of reciprocity between student and teacher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After graduation Silverman initially worked as a graphic designer in Philadelphia but felt that something was missing. “I missed the tangible immediacy of working with physical art materials, and the creative synergy and dynamism of a creative collective environment,” she says. “Working in isolation behind the glow of a computer screen was not how I envisioned my career in art and design, and I knew I needed a change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even before Silverman completed a master’s degree in Visual Arts Education at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia – in record time and supported by a graduate fellowship – she landed her first art education position at her high school alma mater, Archmere Academy, in Claymont, DE. Within six months, she was asked to chair the art department there and three years later moved on to The Tatnall School, a private K-12 day school where she’s now head of the Upper School art program, as well as the interdivisional K-12 art curriculum coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last fall Silverman passed her first attempt at becoming a National Board Certified Teacher (NBCT) with a certificate in Early Adolescence/Young Adulthood Art, making her the only art educator in Delaware private schools to hold the credential. She also serves as the Independent School Representative on the Board of Directors for the Delaware Art Education Association, while making time for her own practice, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s critical that I continue to evolve and grow as an artist,” Silverman says, “and it is especially important that I don’t lose touch with the challenges and thrills of the creative process through my own studio practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At The Tatnall School, Silverman teaches more than 17 art electives, including drawing and painting; 2D, 3D and architectural design; digital media, illustration, printmaking and more. “So much of what I do every day is a direct expression of my experience at RISD,” she says. “The emphasis on deep inquiry, balancing the technical and conceptual, focus on technique and process – all of it is so central to how I teach my classes. And the biggest thrill for me, of course, is when my students apply to RISD.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2010 Silverman’s students have won numerous regional and national awards and more than half a million dollars in scholarships and prizes for their fine art achievements. “My career in art education is a dream come true,” she says. “My students inspire me every day, and I can’t envision a better opportunity for me to share my varied skill set and passions with others in a meaningful and high-impact way.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me.

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Talking Tools&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Talking Tools&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-23&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Worlds within Worlds&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-06&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/WiesnerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;Renowned picture book author/illustrator &lt;a href="http://www.davidwiesner.com" title="David Wiesner 78 IL" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Wiesner 78 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been probing the notion of worlds within worlds since his student days at RISD in the 1970s. “I first explored the ‘cosmic zoom’ in a class with [former Illustration professor and MacArthur Award winner] &lt;a href="http://hmhbooks.com/davidmacaulay/" title="David Macaulay BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;David Macaulay BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” Wiesner recalls. “And I’ve kept coming back to the idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Wiesner played with an iPad, he realized he’d finally found a platform that would allow him to tell a truly nonlinear story steered by the reader. “I’ve always believed that the story is paramount,” notes the three-time &lt;a href="http://www.ala.org/awardsgrants/randolph-caldecott-medal-1" title="Caldecott Medal" target="_blank"&gt;Caldecott Medal&lt;/a&gt; winner, “so I didn’t want to introduce any features that would kill the narrative flow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s first iPad adventure, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hmhbooks.com/spotapp/" title="Spot" target="_blank"&gt;Spot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is being released by Houghton Mifflin this month. The application allows the user to explore a series of ever-smaller microcosms by pinching and zooming – a physical skill, the author/illustrator points out, mastered by children as young as one or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner’s dozens and dozens of detailed watercolor paintings create magical portals that take the reader from a cat parade in Katzaluna to a dust bunny gathering in Lower Rügg to an underwater adventure in Oceana Prime. “Within each world there are different inhabitants and funny situations,” he explains. “But an overarching story runs through all of the worlds, allowing the reader to piece the narrative together by accumulating bits of information in random order.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pushing beyond expectations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readers young and old have been delighting in Wiesner’s beautifully imagined worlds since he published &lt;em&gt;Free Fall&lt;/em&gt; in 1988, which earned him his first Caldecott Honor right out of the gate. He subsequently won additional Caldecott Honors for the heavenly &lt;em&gt;Sector 7&lt;/em&gt; (1999) and the cat-meets-alien tale of &lt;em&gt;Mr. Wuffles!&lt;/em&gt; (2013). In fact, Wiesner has earned more Caldecott Medals – the country’s top prize for picture books – than almost any other author/illustrator in history, winning for his magical farce &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; (1992), his reimagined take on &lt;em&gt;The Three Pigs&lt;/em&gt; (2001) and his fantastical wordless picture book &lt;em&gt;Flotsam &lt;/em&gt; (2006).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of these whimsical works, Wiesner pushes the boundaries of the picture book, surprising the reader again and again with characters who defy expectations, leaping off the page to explore new dimensions or travel back in time. “David’s imagination touches everything before it is rendered,” Macaulay wrote when &lt;em&gt;Tuesday&lt;/em&gt; won the Caldecott in 1992. “He realized that just by changing his point of view, the Derailleur gears on his bike or even the vacuum cleaner could become an amazing technological landscape – jumping-off places for invention and creativity. Nowhere is the power of point of view more clearly displayed, or more masterfully handled, than in &lt;em&gt;Tuesday.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiesner has often credited both Macaulay and late Professor Emeritus &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/38409082276/a-real-loss-for-risd" title="Tom Sgourus 50 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Tom Sgourus 50 IL&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(who died in 2012) with inspiring and encouraging his development as an artist. “Tom and David were always pushing to find new stuff,” he says. “Even after he lost his eyesight, Tom went on to create some of the best art of his life. He is an ongoing inspiration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The art school experience as a whole was eye-opening for Wiesner, who decided as a sophomore in high school that RISD was his next move. “I couldn’t believe such a place existed,” he recalls, “and I couldn’t get there fast enough. &lt;em&gt;Art &amp;amp; Max&lt;/em&gt; [2010] was really about foundation year,” he adds. “I had to unlearn everything, build up again and start over.” (Wiesner’s son Kevin is currently completing his last year in the RISD/Brown &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu" title="Dual Degree Program" target="_blank"&gt;Dual Degree Program&lt;/a&gt; and his daughter Jaime is applying to RISD this year, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although his approach has evolved over the years, Wiesner says that “the basic process is still the same. I’m a big believer in looking at the real thing,” he notes, “which is why I make 3D models – to understand the volume and shape of an illustration and visualize how to create a composition on the page.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that he has completed &lt;em&gt;Spot&lt;/em&gt;, Wiesner is working on a new picture book as well as a graphic novel intended for an older audience. “The graphic novel format allows me to tell a much longer story,” he explains. “I’m using a 2B pencil and then scanning it to get a nice dark line. I love the look of digital color and am learning to do it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m always thinking about what else I can do,” Wiesner adds. “And with every project, I’m looking for an emotional reaction: ‘Oh cool!’ If you get that, what more could you want?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-16&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;

He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students.

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms.

&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;

I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Dealing with Death&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-05&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/chast-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the 2014 release of her latest book &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, cartoonist &lt;a href="http://rozchast.com/" title="Roz Chast 77 PT" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roz Chast 77 PT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hit a nerve with readers across the country. The memoir about the challenges of caring for her elderly parents quickly rose to the top of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; and Amazon bestseller lists for graphic novels, was selected as a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast.html#.VJh-acABg" title="finalist for the National Book Award" target="_blank"&gt;finalist for the National Book Award&lt;/a&gt; in the nonfiction category and made it to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;’ coveted list of &lt;em&gt;The 10 Best Books of 2014&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s an interesting story, but I don’t guess that it’s terribly unusual,” Chast noted in a &lt;a href="http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_nf_chast_interv.html#.VJiAr8ABg" title="National Book Award interview" target="_blank"&gt;National Book Award interview&lt;/a&gt; about creating a book centered on her parents’ end-of-life issues. “As I said to my editor, they should really shelve this in the travel section, because this is definitely like going to another country.” Dealing with elderly parents suffering from the frailties of aging and in need of assisted living and hospice care are “a part of life that I knew nothing about – and that we don’t really talk about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast got her first big break as a cartoonist in 1978 – just a year after graduation – when &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; first published one of her cartoons. She had majored in Painting at RISD because it “seemed more artistic” than her real love and in the 1970s RISD wasn’t really much of “a cartoon kind of a place,” she says. But after graduation, she quickly amassed a portfolio of cartoons and illustrations and did what every aspiring young artist did at the time: carted her work around Manhattan to show it to magazine editors and anyone else who would look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having grown up “uneventfully” in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, Chast moved only once as a child – across the street. The one highlight: her parents subscribed to &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; and she found the morbid wit of &lt;strong&gt;Charles Addams &lt;/strong&gt;(among her favorites) just what she needed to inspire her to begin drawing her own take on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many aspiring cartoonists, Chast discovered that her lifelong tutelage actually paid off when she nervously dropped off her first stack of cartoons at the revered magazine. To her surprise, long-time art editor &lt;strong&gt;Lee Lorenz&lt;/strong&gt; jumped at the opportunity, noting that her work was a breakthrough in the genre. Four decades later, she continues to submit weekly batches to the magazine, producing thousands of brilliant cartoons and seeing well over 1,200 of them published in (and on occasion on the cover of) the magazine so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known for her neurotic view of day-to-day life, Chast uses just the right combination of words and quavery drawings to satirize the anxieties and absurdities of 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;-century America. Her quirky, often twisted cartoons are in a style that remains uniquely her own. “It’s true that I am very good at worrying,” she admits, adding that she’s “horribly, relentlessly serious” – a trait that is more fully illuminated through her new memoir explaining her relationship with her parents. That, she says, is “probably why the other stuff comes out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chast’s cartoons have also been published in magazines such as &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Redbook&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt;, among others. She has written and/or illustrated a dozen books including &lt;em&gt;Childproof: Cartoons About Parents and Children&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Meet My Staff&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mondo Boxo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Unscientific American&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Parallel Universes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter, Z&lt;/em&gt;, the bestselling children’s book by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Martin&lt;/strong&gt;. Her book &lt;em&gt;Theories of Everything: Selected, Collected, and Health-Inspected Cartoons, 1978–2006&lt;/em&gt; (Bloomsbury) is a 400-page compendium of her favorite cartoons produced over three decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2013 Chast was inducted into the American Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences and earned the Reuben Award for Best Gag Cartoon, building on her 2012 win of the New York City Literary Award for Humor. She holds honorary doctorates from Dartmouth College, Lesley University/Art Institute of Boston and Pratt Institute, and is a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the latest attention she has earned for &lt;em&gt;Can’t We Talk About Something More Pleasant?&lt;/em&gt;, Chast says she’s pleased that she was able to remember her parents vividly through the book and be “as truthful as possible” in telling their end-of-life story. “It would have been sort of pointless to do it otherwise,” she notes. “For me to be dishonest about it – to have left out big chunks or to write that I had this wonderful, idyllic childhood where I was happy all the livelong day – would be so untrue that it would be very disrespectful to everyone, including the reader.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Painting from Life&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-03&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/GearanDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Julie Gearan is interested in conveying universal messages through her work. | photo by Scott Lapham 90 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjunct faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/illustration/faculty/Julie-Gearan/" title="Julie Gearan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Julie Gearan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; isn’t known for her portraiture, so she was surprised to learn last winter that her application to paint outgoing Rhode Island Governor &lt;strong&gt;Lincoln Chafee&lt;/strong&gt; had risen to the top of the pile. “I wanted him to know what he was getting into,” she notes drily, “so I invited him to see my work in person in a group show at &lt;a href="http://www.cadetompkins.com" title="Cade Tompkins Projects" target="_blank"&gt;Cade Tompkins Projects&lt;/a&gt; in Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After winning the commission and working on the painting for almost a year – mostly based on Chafee’s multiple sittings in her West Side studio – Gearan unveiled the stately yet decidedly unconventional portrait in January 2015 at the RI State House, where it will remain on permanent display. In it Chafee stands in a long black coat somberly gazing into the distance, his hand resting on a boulder and dark clouds massing behind him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He didn’t like the coat at first,” Gearan recalls. “He was concerned that it would make him look too aristocratic. But I wanted the dark background to come forward and almost envelope him – to create an ambiguous relationship between the background and the figure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan also sees the long, heavy coat as a metaphor for Chafee’s power and responsibility as governor. “That’s a weight that every elected official carries,” she says, adding that the boulder represents his commitment to preserving the environment, and the dark clouds (with just a small opening where the light seeps in) symbolize the tough economic times during which Chafee governed (2010–14).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portrait is inspired by the work of 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Rhode Island painter &lt;strong&gt;Gilbert Stuart&lt;/strong&gt;, but like everything Gearan paints reflects her unique take on the subject she’s portraying. “A portrait is such a personal thing,” she explains. “All of my paintings start with something personal and subjective and then pull back to the universal – honing in on a moment in time that tells a larger story. With a good painting, you feel like there’s a life in there that you just stepped into – like it’s all still going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A series of whale paintings Gearan is currently working on evolved from a moment in time when she encountered &lt;em&gt;Jonah Swallowed&lt;/em&gt;, a small sculpture at the &lt;a href="http://www.clevelandart.org" title="Cleveland Museum of Art" target="_blank"&gt;Cleveland Museum of Art&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a tiny sea creature with human legs sticking out of its mouth,” she explains. “I drew it and then dreamed that night about rescuing a man who was swallowed whole by a fish.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the sculpture dates back to approximately 290 AD, Gearan feels an affinity with artists who came before and studies their work almost as a form of conversation. “These are my people,” she explains. “Looking at their work is like talking to the elders. I don’t know what I would do without their partnership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she teaches painting, however, Gearan is careful not to provide historical references that are too close to a student’s developing style. “There’s a danger in having your work validated too early,” she explains. “I might suggest that a student look at paintings from three different periods so that they don’t feel pigeonholed or become too derivative.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gearan currently teaches part-time in RISD’s &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/illustration/" title="Illustration" target="_blank"&gt;Illustration&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/painting/" title="Painting" target="_blank"&gt;Painting&lt;/a&gt; departments and through &lt;a href="http://ce.risd.edu" title="Continuing Ed" target="_blank"&gt;Continuing Ed&lt;/a&gt; as well as at Roger Williams University. “I love the energy at RISD,” she says, “and I enjoy helping students find different ways to communicate the same idea.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working almost exclusively with oil, Gearan likes “the tooth” of sable paintbrushes and tends to work “big and brushy.” But she’s always challenging her own technique – pushing back as needed for the sake of the work. “The technique,” Gearan notes, “is driven by what the painting requires.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered.

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me.

Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards.

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation.

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered.

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>
    <HMTL>&lt;newsItem&gt;&lt;thumbimage&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethListingHeadshot.jpg&lt;/thumbimage&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Connects with the RISD Community&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/glover-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Building Aspirations&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-09&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/cooper-detail-2.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover speaks at RISD on January 30. // photo by Victoria Will / Invision / AP&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce.

I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects.

At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms.

&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;

I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;

With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR presented EMERALD TABLETS at last year’s New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME) conference. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assistant professor and electronic media artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Shawn-Greenlee/" title="Shawn Greenlee 96 PR" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shawn Greenlee 96 PR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is riding a welcomed wave of support. A full-time faculty member since 2010, he earned a promotion to programs head in Foundation Studies last summer and recently wowed visitors at the RISD Museum when he &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/107440183694/assistant-professor-shawn-greenlee-96-pr-an" title="premiered a new piece" target="_blank"&gt;premiered a new piece&lt;/a&gt; inspired by an ancient Chinese lithophone in the museum’s collection. In February he learned that he’s one of three local composers to win a $25,000 &lt;a href="http://www.rifoundation.org/InsidetheFoundation/OurBlog/TabId/106/PostId/188/rhode-island-foundation-awards-25000-fellowships-to-three-composers.aspx" title="MacColl Johnson Fellowship" target="_blank"&gt;MacColl Johnson Fellowship&lt;/a&gt; from the Rhode Island Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My practice explores how to use new technologies to integrate images and sound in a performance context,” says Greenlee. “I was originally exposed to the ideas that set me on this path during my Foundation year at RISD. Professors like &lt;strong&gt;Gareth Jones&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Victor Lara&lt;/strong&gt; and [former faculty member] &lt;strong&gt;Lea Feinstein&lt;/strong&gt; really encouraged us to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/printmaking/" title="Printmaking" target="_blank"&gt;Printmaking&lt;/a&gt; major at RISD, Greenlee also played bass in a hugely popular noise band in the 1990s before shifting his focus to solo electronic music and then earning one of the first PhDs Brown University ever conferred in Computer Music and New Media. Having begun his computer music practice with sound synthesis, he recently moved into the realm of traditional Asian instruments – although in his hands, they’re used to interface with his own custom-designed software. “I’m looking at centuries-old instruments in the context of emerging technologies,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee’s interest in traditional Korean instruments began in 2012 when he traveled to Seoul to collaborate with a trio of musicians considered to be masters of the &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; (a zither-like instrument similar to the Japanese &lt;em&gt;koto&lt;/em&gt;). Using software he coded himself, he composed unconventional works for the ensemble. “I was composing for an instrument I’d never played myself,” he says. “I had to translate the scores I’d generated algorithmically into notation the musicians could actually play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the new MacColl Johnson support, Greenlee plans to return to Korea this summer to further his research. “My aim is to continue composing for traditional Korean instruments, including the 12-string &lt;em&gt;kayagum&lt;/em&gt; and the stone chime known as &lt;em&gt;pyeongyeong&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “I will focus on creating works for soloists and ensembles in an experimental context and hope that the new pieces will eventually be performed in the US.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the third year running, Greenlee also plans to present at the 2015 conference on &lt;a href="http://www.nime.org" title="New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME)," target="_blank"&gt;New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME),&lt;/a&gt; which will be held in late spring at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. This time he’ll perform &lt;em&gt;Substitutions&lt;/em&gt;, the semi-improvisational piece he premiered at the RISD Museum, played by striking a granite lithophone of his own design and digitally transforming the tones generated into abstract, otherworldly electronica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first blush, these sonic experiments may seem disconnected from the visual arts at the heart of RISD’s curriculum. But Greenlee challenges the notion that the major courses of study here are strictly visual. “What about architecture?” he asks, “or industrial design?” As a sound artist, he actually feels right at home in Foundation Studies and as programs head, thinks a lot about the curriculum and how the various units relate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One thing that is becoming more and more clear to me,” says Greenlee, “is that Foundation year is more about catalyzing than preparing students. There’s some passing on of established knowledge, but there’s also so much experimentation and analysis. It’s a great time for students to cross boundaries and explore what it means to be multidisciplinary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenlee is also pleased to report that the audio component of RISD’s curriculum is expanding and evolving. “There’s a lot of momentum building around this kind of work,” he notes. “Students are excited about integrating this knowledge into whatever major they choose. The majors are deep and disciplinary, but fields of study like sound are really good at bridging majors. And these cross-disciplinary conversations produce outcomes that you would never expect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-23&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/biennial-horizontal-740.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Micah Barrett 12 GD, who teaches in Graphic Design, created this colorful mix and match poster to promote the show.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rockefeller Legacy Benefits Museum&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RockefellerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This pair of Korean wedding chests is part of a generous gift to the RISD Museum from collector and philanthropist David Rockefeller.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on a long legacy of support from his family, &lt;strong&gt;David Rockefeller&lt;/strong&gt; has made a gift of $2.5 million to fund and expand the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;’s collection of decorative arts and design. The new funding provides for an endowed curatorship to help care for the collection, along with $500,000 in support of a new David and Peggy Rockefeller Gallery within its suite of European art galleries in the Radeke building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When my late wife, Peggy, and I discussed the idea of creating a room to reflect our collecting interests, we thought immediately of RISD,” says Rockefeller. “Both sides of my family – Aldriches as well as Rockefellers – have had a long and happy relationship with the RISD Museum. My mother even took a few courses there in the late 19th century, before she married my father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rockefeller also plans to give the museum 43 pieces from his family’s collection of rare furniture and decorative arts, including silver serving pieces and European porcelain. One exceptionally stunning gift is an 8th-century Tang dynasty figure of a standing court lady that was displayed for years in Rockefeller’s office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled that Mr. Rockefeller has chosen to share treasures from his collection with us,” says Museum Director &lt;strong&gt;John W. Smith&lt;/strong&gt;. “Their beauty and rarity will add immeasurably to our already impressive collection of decorative arts and design, and fill voids – particularly in our collection of English works – with objects of a quality we could never otherwise hope to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth A. Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the museum’s curatorial staff in 2013, is now its first David and Peggy Rockefeller Curator of Decorative Arts and Design. She plans to make good use of the new resources by continuing to expand exhibition and education programs and further preservation and conservation efforts. Since the collection under her care is heavily used by students and faculty at RISD, Brown and other nearby colleges, she is committed to presenting an interpretative approach that encourages deep engagement with the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams is particularly excited about a pair of soft-paste porcelain river gods made by the French Vincennes manufactory. Extremely rare, these pieces are from the collection of Rockefeller’s aunt, a longtime Providence resident. The family’s huge Qing Dynasty service of ornate Chinese exportware porcelain is also a welcomed addition and considered one of the finest examples of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this generous gift, David Rockefeller continues his family’s nearly century-long relationship with the RISD Museum,” notes Smith, “once again making significant and lasting contributions to the museum and Rhode Island. It is rare for a museum to be able to share with one family such a long and important history of generosity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Biennial Showcases Teachers’ Talents &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-23&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/biennial-horizontal-740.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Micah Barrett 12 GD, who teaches in Graphic Design, created this colorful mix and match poster to promote the show.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rockefeller Legacy Benefits Museum&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RockefellerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This pair of Korean wedding chests is part of a generous gift to the RISD Museum from collector and philanthropist David Rockefeller.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on a long legacy of support from his family, &lt;strong&gt;David Rockefeller&lt;/strong&gt; has made a gift of $2.5 million to fund and expand the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;’s collection of decorative arts and design. The new funding provides for an endowed curatorship to help care for the collection, along with $500,000 in support of a new David and Peggy Rockefeller Gallery within its suite of European art galleries in the Radeke building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When my late wife, Peggy, and I discussed the idea of creating a room to reflect our collecting interests, we thought immediately of RISD,” says Rockefeller. “Both sides of my family – Aldriches as well as Rockefellers – have had a long and happy relationship with the RISD Museum. My mother even took a few courses there in the late 19th century, before she married my father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rockefeller also plans to give the museum 43 pieces from his family’s collection of rare furniture and decorative arts, including silver serving pieces and European porcelain. One exceptionally stunning gift is an 8th-century Tang dynasty figure of a standing court lady that was displayed for years in Rockefeller’s office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled that Mr. Rockefeller has chosen to share treasures from his collection with us,” says Museum Director &lt;strong&gt;John W. Smith&lt;/strong&gt;. “Their beauty and rarity will add immeasurably to our already impressive collection of decorative arts and design, and fill voids – particularly in our collection of English works – with objects of a quality we could never otherwise hope to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth A. Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the museum’s curatorial staff in 2013, is now its first David and Peggy Rockefeller Curator of Decorative Arts and Design. She plans to make good use of the new resources by continuing to expand exhibition and education programs and further preservation and conservation efforts. Since the collection under her care is heavily used by students and faculty at RISD, Brown and other nearby colleges, she is committed to presenting an interpretative approach that encourages deep engagement with the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams is particularly excited about a pair of soft-paste porcelain river gods made by the French Vincennes manufactory. Extremely rare, these pieces are from the collection of Rockefeller’s aunt, a longtime Providence resident. The family’s huge Qing Dynasty service of ornate Chinese exportware porcelain is also a welcomed addition and considered one of the finest examples of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this generous gift, David Rockefeller continues his family’s nearly century-long relationship with the RISD Museum,” notes Smith, “once again making significant and lasting contributions to the museum and Rhode Island. It is rare for a museum to be able to share with one family such a long and important history of generosity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the bone-chilling winter weather, hordes of art lovers turned out last Thursday evening for the opening of the &lt;a title="RISD Faculty Biennial" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the RISD Museum. Curated by Director of Campus Exhibitions &lt;strong&gt;Mark Moscone 88 PR&lt;/strong&gt;, the vibrant show presents an expansive range of work by 185 full- and part-time faculty members, filling galleries on two floors of the Chace Center. “I hope the show stimulates a sense of curiosity,” says Moscone. “I would encourage visitors to take the time to really investigate work that catches their attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the exhibiting artists are showing pieces representative of their best-known work, while others have taken the opportunity to step outside of their usual milieus to create delightful surprises. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Aaron-Forrest/" title="Aaron Forrest " target="_blank"&gt;Aaron Forrest &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Yasmin-Vobis/" title="Yasmin Vobis" target="_blank"&gt;Yasmin Vobis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, who teach in the Architecture department, collaborated with &lt;strong&gt;Ajay Manthripragada&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Howard Huang&lt;/strong&gt; to create the concrete and steel &lt;em&gt;Periphon&lt;/em&gt;, an installation that greets visitors at the top of the escalator to the third floor. And filmmaker &lt;a title="Agnieszka Woznicka" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/fav/faculty/Agnieszka-Woznicka/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agnieszka Woznicka&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; strays from her usual medium with &lt;em&gt;Unearthed&lt;/em&gt;, a series of organic wall hangings made from crocheted wire. “The show gives people an opportunity to experiment a little bit and get feedback from their peers,” one appreciative visitor notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drawing a Line,&lt;/em&gt; a video and paint installation by Jewelry + Metalsmithing Critic &lt;a title="Sissi Westerberg" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, proved to be a crowd favorite at the opening. In the video, the artist – wearing nothing but a trench coat – surreptitiously opens the front of the coat to use her pubic hair to apply a bright pink line on an otherwise blank white wall. “I think it’s a great political commentary,” one amused viewer comments, “but I also really appreciate the artist’s use of humor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students and staff also welcomed the opportunity to see celebrated works of art up close. Many were lured in by the seductive sheen of Sculpture Professor &lt;a title="Dean Snyder" style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Dean-Snyder/" target="_blank"&gt;Dean Snyder&lt;/a&gt;’s large, curvaceous piece &lt;em&gt;Nevermind.&lt;/em&gt; And the emotional power of &lt;em&gt;Emerge No. 1&lt;/em&gt;, an etching portraying psychological turmoil by Foundation Studies Critic &lt;a title="Clara Lieu 98 IL" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/faculty/Clara-Lieu/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clara Lieu 98 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increases exponentially when experienced in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the lighter side are stunning explorations of pattern by Graphic Design Professor &lt;a title="Lucinda Hitchcock" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, created by manipulating digital letterforms. And the deliciously chunky &lt;em&gt;Folding Garden Chair&lt;/em&gt;, handcrafted of oak and nickel by Associate Professor of Furniture Design &lt;a title="Chris Rose" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/furniture-design/faculty/Christopher-Rose/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Rose&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combines traditional techniques with a clean, modern sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the biennial, which continues through March 22, a new &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title="Faculty Forum" href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" target="_blank"&gt;Faculty Forum&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; series invites viewers to learn about the work of other RISD faculty artists not featured in the exhibition. Beginning on Wednesday, February 25, selected artists and designers will present brief discussions, readings and performances that shed light on their work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Rockefeller Legacy Benefits Museum&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-11&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/RockefellerDetail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This pair of Korean wedding chests is part of a generous gift to the RISD Museum from collector and philanthropist David Rockefeller.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on a long legacy of support from his family, &lt;strong&gt;David Rockefeller&lt;/strong&gt; has made a gift of $2.5 million to fund and expand the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;’s collection of decorative arts and design. The new funding provides for an endowed curatorship to help care for the collection, along with $500,000 in support of a new David and Peggy Rockefeller Gallery within its suite of European art galleries in the Radeke building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When my late wife, Peggy, and I discussed the idea of creating a room to reflect our collecting interests, we thought immediately of RISD,” says Rockefeller. “Both sides of my family – Aldriches as well as Rockefellers – have had a long and happy relationship with the RISD Museum. My mother even took a few courses there in the late 19th century, before she married my father.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rockefeller also plans to give the museum 43 pieces from his family’s collection of rare furniture and decorative arts, including silver serving pieces and European porcelain. One exceptionally stunning gift is an 8th-century Tang dynasty figure of a standing court lady that was displayed for years in Rockefeller’s office at 30 Rockefeller Plaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are thrilled that Mr. Rockefeller has chosen to share treasures from his collection with us,” says Museum Director &lt;strong&gt;John W. Smith&lt;/strong&gt;. “Their beauty and rarity will add immeasurably to our already impressive collection of decorative arts and design, and fill voids – particularly in our collection of English works – with objects of a quality we could never otherwise hope to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth A. Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the museum’s curatorial staff in 2013, is now its first David and Peggy Rockefeller Curator of Decorative Arts and Design. She plans to make good use of the new resources by continuing to expand exhibition and education programs and further preservation and conservation efforts. Since the collection under her care is heavily used by students and faculty at RISD, Brown and other nearby colleges, she is committed to presenting an interpretative approach that encourages deep engagement with the objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams is particularly excited about a pair of soft-paste porcelain river gods made by the French Vincennes manufactory. Extremely rare, these pieces are from the collection of Rockefeller’s aunt, a longtime Providence resident. The family’s huge Qing Dynasty service of ornate Chinese exportware porcelain is also a welcomed addition and considered one of the finest examples of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With this generous gift, David Rockefeller continues his family’s nearly century-long relationship with the RISD Museum,” notes Smith, “once again making significant and lasting contributions to the museum and Rhode Island. It is rare for a museum to be able to share with one family such a long and important history of generosity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC with the results of his PRINTING OUT THE INTERNET challenge, shown in 2013 at Mexico City’s Labor Gallery. &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a creative practitioner in the digital age? With 24/7 web access and the accompanying information overload, is it still possible to hatch an original idea? Or does all creative production rely on reexamining and reconfiguring what came before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ubuweb.com" title="Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kenneth Goldsmith 84 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a poet and author of the influential book &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Writing: Managing Language in the Digital Age&lt;/em&gt; (2011) – visited RISD last week to share his latest thoughts on open culture, appropriation and lack of originality as part of a cross-disciplinary symposium on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/uncreative_practices_a_cross-divisional_risd_symposium_with_kenneth_goldsmith#.VQN0nrDF9JE" title="Uncreative Practices" target="_blank"&gt;Uncreative Practices&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Organized by Professor of Literary Arts + Studies &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/las/faculty/Mair%C3%A9ad-Byrne/" title="Mairéad Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mairéad Byrne&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Assistant Professor of Digital + Media &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Shona-Kitchen/" title="Shona Kitchen" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shona Kitchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, D+M Lecturer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Lisa-Z--Morgan/" title="Lisa Z. Morgan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lisa Z. Morgan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Assistant Professor of Graphic Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Clement-Valla/" title="Clement Valla MFA 09 DM" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Clement Valla MFA 09 DM&lt;/a&gt;, the symposium was presented as part of the RISD Museum’s ongoing series of forums augmenting the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org/art_design/exhibitions/risd_faculty_biennial" title="RISD Faculty Biennial" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RISD Faculty Biennial&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well-attended event paired live discussion with a collaborative online exercise in which students, faculty and other audience members reflected on the proceedings in real time by adding words and images to a shared Google document displayed on a large screen behind the speakers. The flurry of on-screen activity both complemented and competed with the panelists’ prepared statements. Much like social media channels, the Google doc provided a platform that allowed even shy members of the audience to participate anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With popular memes and images of Kenny G., &lt;em&gt;Futurama’&lt;/em&gt;s Fry, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;’s Morpheus and (of course) cats flashing behind him, Goldsmith spoke eloquently about the desperate need for academics to reconceive notions of pedagogy, plagiarism and critical inquiry to reflect the mash-up mindset of modern-day reality. “Where tech leads, art and culture follow,” he noted. “The boundaries between high and low art have been annihilated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith likes to describe the ubiquitous and arguably benign nature of the web through analogy, comparing the online world his students were born into to the TV age in which he and his peers grew up. He related his father’s groundless worries about TV destroying his imagination to current concerns among 40- and 50-somethings about the amount of time their kids “are wasting on the Internet.” Context is the new content, he pointed out, and the process by which we use the web is far more enlightening than any resulting cultural artifacts we create. In the words of &lt;strong&gt;Bob Dylan&lt;/strong&gt;, he added, “only wussies and pussies complain about appropriation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty members who have been integrating Goldsmith’s ideas into their teaching followed up by presenting their own thoughts on the subjects of appropriation and “uncreativity” using unusual, sometimes poetic devices. Byrne, for example, shed light on notions of reference and citation in a rhythmic recitation that was part academia, part spoken word poetry. And grad student &lt;strong&gt;Jane Long MFA 15 DM&lt;/strong&gt; reflected on the collaborative spirit of crowd-sourced creation by inviting the audience to recite phrases she projected on the large screen and then responded to herself, creating a call-and-response exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valla, who shared student work made in his &lt;em&gt;Uncreative Design&lt;/em&gt; class, offered perhaps the most concrete take on the topic. The projects he showed are less about appropriation and more about organizing and attempting to understand the world in which we live. In one, for instance, a student parses the lyrics of popular rappers to determine what, exactly, these artists are trying to say. Another presents comical charts classifying the many different types of beards the student discovered in paintings at a Paris museum. “I’ve found that the question ‘why not?’ is far more fruitful in the classroom than ‘why?’” Valla noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the discussion that followed, students and professors remained divided about whether it’s time to start using the web as just another tool – like paint or gesso – or to continue to be awed by its unprecedented power to feed us everything under the sun. &lt;strong&gt;Jennifer Liese&lt;/strong&gt;, director of the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="RISD Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;, came away from the symposium with the sense that remixing is only one of many ways in which we’re responding to “the digital condition.” And Graphic Design Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/graphic-design/faculty/Lucinda-Hitchcock/" title="Lucinda Hitchcock" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucinda Hitchcock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wondered aloud if the test of true art is its ability to move people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldsmith let late avant-garde composer &lt;strong&gt;John Cage&lt;/strong&gt; have the final word on creativity vs. uncreativity, quoting a comment Cage made in response to whether or not his own work was original. “It’s true that anyone can do what I do,” Cage purportedly said, “but no one did.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen.

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Danny Glover connects with RISD students prior to his talk. | photo by David O’Connor&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt; wrapped up his visit to RISD last Friday with a heartfelt, stream-of-conscious talk delivered to a packed house in RISD’s main auditorium. “Design is a deliberate act of imagination,” the dapper 68-year-old declared in presenting RISD’s 2015 Martin Luther King, Jr. keynote address. “It is our mandate to use art as a platform for love and empathy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In welcoming him, interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described Glover as “a role model for fellow creatives – a community activist and philanthropist who uses his visibility to effect positive change.” And faculty moderator &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/photography/faculty/Ann-Fessler/" title="Ann Fessler" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ann Fessler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – a professor in RISD’s Photography department – applauded his successful efforts to “shine a light on injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover walked side by side with civil rights leaders in the 1960s and has since worked tirelessly for social justice at home and abroad. He has served as an ambassador for the United Nations and UNICEF, supported union laborers, earned a Pioneer Award from the National Civil Rights Museum and the Medaille des Arts et des Lettres from the French Ministry of Culture as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of San Francisco, in the city he has called home his entire life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the RISD community, Glover was characteristically humble, admitting that when it comes to social justice and creating a better world, he has more questions than answers. He liberally referenced the words of great artists such as &lt;strong&gt;James Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Langston Hughes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lorraine Hansberry&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Clifford Odets&lt;/strong&gt;, among others. “The precise role of the artist,” he said, quoting Baldwin, “is to illuminate the darkness, blaze roads through that vast forest so that we will not in all our doing lose sight of its purpose, which is, after all, to make the world a more human dwelling place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover also spoke favorably of the time he’d spent at RISD earlier in the day, noting that his spirit was fed by &lt;a href="http://our.risd.edu/post/104703304309/tapping-a-no-2-pencil-garcia-sinclair-15" title="Kindred" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindred&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show featuring work by students of African descent at the Gelman Student Exhibitions Gallery. He encouraged students in the audience to reflect on the women – “the nonconformists and rebels” – who founded RISD in the 1870s, 40 years before women had the right to vote in the US, and to doggedly consider their own ethics as artists. “A new world is possible if we imagine it so,” he professed. “That is our task, mandate and salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After his talk, Glover answered a few questions from the audience and signed autographs. In response to a question about his own journey, he noted, “I stand on the shoulders of those who came before. The deep responsibility I feel becomes deeper as I advance in age. It keeps me up at night and wakes me in the morning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Glover Headlines MLK Celebration&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-12&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Danny-Glover.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover speaks at RISD on January 30. // photo by Victoria Will / Invision / AP&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Fostering Creative Communication&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-21&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/MLK-Day-detail-best.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <Title>Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity</Title>

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover speaks at RISD on January 30. // photo by Victoria Will / Invision / AP&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iconoclasts Coming for Commencement&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-18&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Waters-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;The one and only John Waters is coming to RISD to accept an honorary degree and speak to graduating students.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, May 30, filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; will accept his first honorary degree ever at RISD’s 2015 Commencement ceremony, where he’ll also deliver the keynote address. Waters is one of several icons of contemporary culture who will travel to Providence to celebrate with graduating students and their families at the Rhode Island Convention Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other special guests accepting honorary degrees this year are art and culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/strong&gt; and musicians and former Talking Heads&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;members&lt;strong&gt; Chris Frantz 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tina Weymouth 74 PT&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt;. In addition, painter &lt;strong&gt;Miriam Beerman 45 PT&lt;/strong&gt; is being honored with the 2015 Alumni Award for Artistic Achievement. This year’s honorees will join the 690 students who are collecting their hard-earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the extra-exuberant ceremony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seen as “an enduring inspiration for RISD students seeking to break boundaries, challenge conventions and define an expressive style,” as President &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://president.risd.edu" title="Rosanne Somerson 76 ID" target="_blank"&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a message sent to the campus community today, &lt;strong&gt;John Waters&lt;/strong&gt; has written and directed 16 movies, several starring the memorable Divine. In 2014 the Film Society of Lincoln Center honored him with the 10-day retrospective &lt;a href="http://www.filmlinc.com/films/series/50-years-of-john-waters-how-much-can-you-take"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fifty Years of John Waters: How Much Can You Take?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, screening such gems as &lt;em&gt;Pink Flamingos&lt;/em&gt; (1972), &lt;em&gt;Polyester&lt;/em&gt; (1981), &lt;em&gt;Cry-Baby&lt;/em&gt; (1990), &lt;em&gt;Serial Mom&lt;/em&gt; (1991) and &lt;em&gt;Hairspray&lt;/em&gt; (1988), which went on to become an award-winning Broadway musical. Waters has also published books and screenplays, including the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Carsick&lt;/em&gt; (2014) and &lt;em&gt;Roll Models&lt;/em&gt; (2010), and shows his photographs and sculptures in galleries throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RISD is recognizing &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.adamgopnik.com/"&gt;Adam Gopnik&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a staff writer at &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, for his insights and humane criticism about contemporary art and culture. Over the past three decades, he served as &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;’s art critic from 1987–95 and has contributed fiction, humor, book reviews and profiles to the magazine, earning the National Magazine Award for Essays and Criticism three times. A keen cultural critic, Gopnik is also a novelist and a much-admired speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alumni &lt;strong&gt;Chris Frantz&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Tina Weymouth&lt;/strong&gt; began playing music with &lt;strong&gt;David Byrne &lt;/strong&gt;while they were still at RISD but founded the band Talking Heads when they moved to New York two years later, performing for the first time in 1975. &lt;strong&gt;Jerry Harrison&lt;/strong&gt; had played keyboards in the seminal punk rock band The Modern Lovers before joining Talking Heads in 1976. A year later, the band released its first album, which was immediately hailed as a breakthrough for its bold mix of performance art, punk, funk, new wave and intelligent lyrics. Talking Heads went on to tour the world, record 10 albums and work with director &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Demme&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Stop Making Sense&lt;/em&gt;, among the best concert films of all time. Their many hits – including &lt;em&gt;Psycho Killer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Once in Lifetime&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Road to Nowhere&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Take Me to the River&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Burning Down the House&lt;/em&gt; – earned Talking Heads induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrison has since released three solo albums, produced recordings for such artists as the &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Violent Femmes&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Foo Fighters&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;No Doubt&lt;/span&gt;, and helped to define the rapidly evolving online music industry. Frantz and Weymouth formed the band &lt;a href="http://tomtomclub.com/" style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Tom Tom Club&lt;/a&gt; in 1981, which led to their first gold record through the hits &lt;em&gt;Wordy Rappinghood&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Genius of Love&lt;/em&gt;. They continue to record and tour, and recently embarked on a new electronic music project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given her health, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="miriambeerman.com" title="Miriam Beerman" target="_blank"&gt;Miriam Beerman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is unable to travel to Providence to accept the Alumni Association’s Award for Artistic Achievement in person, but her son will do so on her behalf. At RISD she discovered a lifelong love of abstract expressionism that blossomed into a deeply satisfying 65-year career in which she embraced the “beauty and vigor” of painting as a means of bearing witness to the injustices, atrocities and absurdities of our times. Along the way she exhibited in 32 solo shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaired by Dean of Liberal Arts &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Daniel Cavicchi&lt;/span&gt;, RISD’s 2015 Honorary Degree Committee selected this year’s recipients from a list of dozens of nominations from the campus community. Other committee members this round were the RISD Museum’s Curator of Contemporary Art &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Dominic Molon&lt;/span&gt;, Assistant Professor of Painting &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Angela Dufresne&lt;/span&gt;, Head of Landscape Architecture &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Scheri Fultineer&lt;/span&gt;, trustees &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Amy Korenvaes 74 SC&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Meghan Reilly Michaud 01 GD&lt;/span&gt;, and student representatives &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Winston Cuevas&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Alexander Stewart&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Architecture Professor Jim Barnes BArch 69 mentors local teens considering careers in architecture, construction and engineering.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;After getting a taste for the field through the &lt;em&gt;Great Gumdrop Pasta Tower Challenge&lt;/em&gt;, local high school students participating in the &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org/affiliates/rhode-island/" title="Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program" target="_blank"&gt;Rhode Island ACE Mentor Program&lt;/a&gt; are continuing to learn about space, scale, planning and building. A &lt;a href="http://www.acementor.org" title="national organization" target="_blank"&gt;national organization&lt;/a&gt; focused on Architecture, Construction and Engineering, ACE works to engage teenagers with an interest in pursuing careers related to the construction industry and help them get there through scholarships and grants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to providing hands-on learning, “the fundamental goal is to provide one-on-one mentoring for inner-city kids who need it,” says Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Jim-Barnes/" title="Jim Barnes BArch 69" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jim Barnes BArch 69&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who has spearheaded and designed ACE programs in Rhode Island since 2007. Now that the current class of 15 first-year participants is nearing the end of the 18-week, after-school program, students are working in teams in RISD’s Bayard Ewing Building to create final projects with the help of their mentors: graduate students in Architecture and local professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They’re working on designs for a three-story row house with a commercial space on the ground floor,” says Barnes. “But again, the project is really more of a vehicle for stimulating dialogue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Learning to draft and draw takes time,” adds mentor/architect &lt;strong&gt;Ian Manize&lt;/strong&gt;. “Our objective is to teach the kids to think a project through. Always try at least a couple of ideas,” he advises the student at his side, suggesting he sketch a few more options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students at another table have decided to add a bookstore café on the first floor of the row house they’re designing and are grappling with options for situating the entrance and stairs. “We can create a side entry, but if we want to move the stairs,” cautions mentor &lt;strong&gt;Gena Farkas MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt;, “we need to make sure we have room on all three levels.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Architecture department’s CAD Lab, other ACE students are learning how to convert their drawings into digital renderings using basic 3D modeling programs such as &lt;em&gt;SketchUp&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll use the resulting images to create large display boards for upcoming project presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In a couple of weeks they’ll be presenting their work to their parents and to another ACE group that meets in [the neighboring city of] Pawtucket,” says Barnes. “Each student in the group is required to do part of the presentation, which adds a public speaking component to the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year the teenagers in Barnes’ program will move on to a class taught by his former student &lt;strong&gt;Tami Hughes BArch 02&lt;/strong&gt;, who works at the Providence-based firm &lt;a href="http://www.durkeebrown.com/" title="Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp;amp; Werenfels Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Durkee, Brown, Viveiros &amp;amp; Werenfels Architects&lt;/a&gt;. “The older kids have the opportunity to compete in a nationwide competition,” says Barnes. “In 2013 a group of students from the Pawtucket group traveled to Washington, DC to present their projects and ended up winning third place. It was awesome!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Face painting was one of the most popular activities facilitated by RISD volunteers attending Monday's MLK Day of Service.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seated in Providence’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www1.providenceschools.org/elementary-schools/king"&gt;Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School&lt;/a&gt; cafeteria, &lt;strong&gt;Yuko Okabe 17 IL&lt;/strong&gt; watches intently as a six-year-old girl transforms a square sheet of paper into an origami frog. Once she has finished folding it, the girl presses a finger on the frog’s back legs, making it spring along the table littered with bits of tape and rainbow-colored confetti. With a smile of delight, she tucks the small pet into a plastic baggie containing a growing collection of paper treasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arts educators were pleased to see this heartwarming interaction and countless others unfold during Monday’s &lt;a target="_blank" href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VL7PpmTF_hF"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt; – an annual cornerstone of &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/"&gt;RISD’s Martin Luther King, Jr. Series&lt;/a&gt;. On January 19 – the federal holiday marking King’s lasting impact – approximately 160 RISD students volunteered to engage a peppy group of diverse elementary school children in games, craft projects and conversation. Each year RISD partners with the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.mthopelc.org/category/news/"&gt;Mt. Hope Learning Center&lt;/a&gt; to host the inspirational event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RISD students are interested in transformational activities that have potential to shift mindsets and make real change,” notes Interim President &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who participated in the event again this year. “Today they’re exposing young children to the arts – a medium that often breaks down barriers by acting as a line of communication between people. This event is incredibly empowering for everyone involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the school, volunteers work hand-in-hand with participating kids to make a wide array of inventive projects. Wearing a tri-cornered hat made of newspaper, &lt;strong&gt;Yalda Foroughmand Arabi 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; helps a young boy fasten a knot on the end of a yellow beaded bracelet. In the middle of the task, another child tugs on her arm and asks for help in making a keychain for his mother. “I signed up to volunteer because I’m interested in teaching one day,” the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/foundation-studies/"&gt;Foundation Studies&lt;/a&gt; student explains. “This is definitely a good training ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;Eric Telfort 05 IL&lt;/strong&gt;, executive director of the Mt. Hope Learning Center, arranges a group of RISD students into a neat semicircle toward the entrance of the building. He advises each of the artists and designers to actively listen to the children’s needs and use objective language when speaking about their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are different types of intelligences – every child learns in their own way,” Telfort explains. “Some are apt to quietly experiment with materials. Others want to talk out their thinking process. Whatever the case, just being a present and supportive figure is active engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a far corner of the room, AmeriCorps VISTA &lt;strong&gt;Emily Gonzalez&lt;/strong&gt; lays a tarp on the floor being careful not to spill a cluster of plastic bowls filled with neon paint. She encourages the eager kids to splatter wild streaks of acrylics across the blank canvas, which will eventually be hung as decoration in the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Service should never take a day off,” Gonzalez notes. “It’s so important to remain connected to our neighboring communities. We all rise higher when we come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Gensler Grants Golden Opportunity &lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-03-30&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/CherethDetailRendering.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;This proposed public housing project helped earn Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16 both a scholarship and an internship.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Architecture grad student &lt;strong&gt;Chereth Hines-Channer MArch 16&lt;/strong&gt; is thrilled to have earned first prize in the &lt;a href="http://www.gensler.com/scholarships" title="2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition" target="_blank"&gt;2015 Gensler Diversity Scholarship competition&lt;/a&gt;, which opens the door to a coveted opportunity to intern at one of the world’s leading architecture firms. Now in its seventh year, the competition is open to black students studying architecture in the US. A team of judges selected by Gensler – a large international architectural firm known for such edifices as the Shanghai Tower in China and Terminal 2 at the San Francisco International Airport – recognizes top students each year, providing each of them with an academic scholarship and a paid summer internship in one of the firm’s many offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m hoping to work in the New York office, where I have family and an apartment I can use,” says Hines-Channer. After visiting the Gensler office in her hometown of San José, Costa Rica, she says she’s “really impressed by its collaborative atmosphere. It’s almost like a playground, where people get a chance to experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/119727427?color=c9161f&amp;amp;title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Hines-Channer explains in this video (made by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.anderimage.com/about/" title="Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV" target="_blank"&gt;Andreas Nicholas 13 FAV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), her winning project offers a modular solution to the many problems associated with low-income public housing – specifically in the failing Los Pinos projects in San José.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I designed a live-work space with the help of the children and adults who live in the Los Pinos community,” Hines-Channer says. “The interior and exterior are connected and include social spaces to be used communally, and the structure of the modules suits the region’s sloped, mountainous terrain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her work to date, Hines-Channer has focused on creating a sense of tranquility and on employing human-centered design, a process that – like her San José project – begins with listening to the on-site community. “Architects don’t always know what people really want,” she explains. “With this project, I asked the kids to draw what they wanted. And I spoke with their mothers – many of whom take in sewing and shoe repair work – about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; wanted to see. I learned that they are comfortable with shared, communal resources and not interested in [amenities like] private backyards, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a young age Hines-Channer knew that she didn’t want to follow her parents’ footsteps into the field of medicine. “I can’t stand the sight of blood,” she admits with a laugh. So she began exploring architecture, earning her undergraduate degree from Universidad Veritas in Costa Rica, which she describes as having a “more technical” approach than at RISD. Here, she appreciates RISD’s liberal arts and varied fine arts offerings and says that the wide exposure helps her to think outside the box as an architect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m taking courses in photography, furniture design, landscape architecture . . . and it all plays into my work,” she says. “I also enjoy painting, which helps me with the conceptual part of design. And I’ll sometimes start an architecture project with a series of abstract drawings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hines-Channer traveled to Sri Lanka last year as part of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/news/2014/sustainable-solutions-for-sri-lanka/" title="Northern Visions Sri Lanka" target="_blank"&gt;Northern Visions Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a Wintersession course taught by Landscape Architecture Professor &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/Responsive/faculty_profile.aspx?id=6442456530" title="Lili Hermann" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lili Hermann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers one of her mentors. “The trip was really inspiring,” she recalls. “Lili has encouraged me to build connections, as has [Architecture Department Head] &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Laura-Briggs/" title="Laura Briggs BArch 82" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laura Briggs BArch 82&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura is the reason I applied for the scholarship in the first place. She said I’d be a good candidate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After deciding to apply, Hines-Channer conferred with previous competition winners, including &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Designs_to_Make_a_Difference.aspx?dept=4294967928" title="Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12" target="_blank"&gt;Nathalie Jolivert BArch 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who was awarded first prize in 2011. “Everyone I spoke to said that the Gensler internship is an incredible learning experience – demanding but worth every second,” she notes. “I’m super excited to get started!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Making a Living Making Art&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-25&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/career-center-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students meet with Larry Ossei-Mensah and Amani Olu, cofounders of The MEDIUM Group, a New York-based consulting firm.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late last summer &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/thk" target="_blank"&gt;Tomas Hernando Kofman 16 PT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; climbed a ladder and wriggled his way into a tiny white-walled room in the center of a Brooklyn art studio. He needed to put the finishing touches on &lt;a href="http://fivedogsonamountain.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five Dogs on Mountain&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a thought-provoking installation that changes with each showing. Like most of the junior’s work, the project was labor-intensive – meant to question the meaning of visual language along with our understanding of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Some said the piece was ‘pure’ and ‘intimately beautiful,’” Kofman says in a warm, caramelly voice. “That’s the biggest compliment anyone could ever pay me as an artist. The authenticity of my work is what’s most important to me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite feeling good about his work, once Kofman returned to RISD in the fall he began struggling with nagging worries about life after graduation. Though he still has another year and a half in the Painting department, he continues to fret about how to pay rent and buy groceries while pursuing a spiritually and emotionally rewarding creative practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People claim the art world is a corrupt, evil whirlpool that sucks you in to steal your soul,” Kofman confides. “No one wants to end up as the allegorical fine artist who spends his whole life making meaningful work only to be mistreated by curators and gallerists and living out his last days broke and embittered. For students this is a real fear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one flurry-filled morning, the junior jumped at an invitation sent by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. It was to attend &lt;em&gt;The Rules: How to play the art game without sacrificing artistic integrit&lt;/em&gt;y, a January event that focused on professional practices for fine artists. There, Kofman and other interested students met with &lt;strong&gt;Larry Ossei-Mensah&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Amani Olu&lt;/strong&gt;, cofounders of &lt;a href="http://wearemedium.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The MEDIUM Group&lt;/a&gt;, a New York-based consulting firm that helps creative individuals and companies navigate the art world. &lt;strong&gt;Joseph Campbell&lt;/strong&gt;, gallery owner and director of &lt;a href="http://www.carrollandsons.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Carroll and Sons&lt;/a&gt;, also offered insider tips and advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The insights these speakers shared are invaluable to students and recent graduates attempting to break into the fine art market,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “It can be an intimidating venture – but RISD students are extremely savvy in making inroads with established artists, curators and gallery owners. They are uniquely positioned to find success on their own terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addressing how to make it without selling out, the visiting entrepreneurs offered encouraging words of wisdom, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself as an artist – and maintaining genuine connections that will help new graduates achieve long-term goals. “Besides the act of making good work, I didn't know of any social strategies that could help me cultivate a successful art career,” notes Kofman. “So it was reassuring to talk to people who have an intimate understanding of this highly competitive business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although she’s still a sophomore,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/ArianaLMartinez" target="_blank"&gt;Ariana Martinez 17 SC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; also &lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;attended the workshop to try to start thinking about a professional plan post-graduation. Listening to the presenters she felt elated to hear that artists don’t have to choose between passion and a paycheck. “In the future, I’d like to open my own practice centered on building communities,” explains the &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree Student&lt;/a&gt; who’s majoring in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; at RISD and Urban Studies at Brown. “After attending this workshop, I’m completely unafraid to follow my intuition wherever it may guide me. And that’s an amazing feeling.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards. But a connection made face-to-face tends to be more memorable for the person who’s hiring. Countless alums have landed plum positions after attending one of these networking sessions, which provide personal access to some of the leading thinkers in design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Actor and humanitarian Danny Glover speaks at RISD on January 30. // photo by Victoria Will / Invision / AP&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;The Seduction of Skin&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-13&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Skin-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin for a bag she made in a Wintersession studio called SKIN.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;A shrill, electric buzz resonates throughout the studio as &lt;strong&gt;Kyra Markosian 16 JM&lt;/strong&gt; tattoos a fresh piece of vegetable-tanned calfskin slathered with a thin sheet of Vaseline. Keeping a close eye on the pulsating needle filled with dark India ink, the junior draws crisp mountain ridges, moons and forest beasts symbolizing iconic moments from her past. The finely decorated scraps will be used to make a sturdy backpack with thin shoulder straps and a metal clasp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Drag the needle evenly across the material. That’s how you make precise lines,” Markosian demonstrates with a steady hand. “These tattoos tell stories from my life and Armenian heritage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally inspired by the complex symbolism found in Russian prison tattoos, the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/jewelry-metalsmithing/" title="Jewelry + Metalsmithing" target="_blank"&gt;Jewelry + Metalsmithing&lt;/a&gt; major made the bag as a final project for &lt;em&gt;Skin: Adornment and Crafted Barriers&lt;/em&gt;, a cross-disciplinary Wintersession studio taught by Swedish artist &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/landscape-architecture/faculty/Sissi-Westerberg/" title="Sissi Westerberg" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sissi Westerberg&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who teaches in J+M, and &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/faculty/Maria-Canada/" title="Maria Canada 14 AP/SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maria Canada 14 AP/SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an instructor in &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/apparel-design/" title="Apparel Design" target="_self"&gt;Apparel Design&lt;/a&gt;. Students in the studio translated the cultural histories, biological properties and psychological implications of human skin into body adornments and wearable pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For centuries this permeable barrier has captivated the minds of poets, architects, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers,” explains Westerberg. “Skin has the tendency to excite and repel simultaneously. It keeps us separated from the world and it's also what keeps our bodies together. As artists it's interesting to think about what skin might represent in a wider context.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the 13 undergraduate students enrolled in the course visited &lt;a href="http://www.pergamena.net/" target="_blank"&gt;Pergamena&lt;/a&gt;, a family-owned tannery in Montgomery, NY. There, they watched intently as raw animal hides were processed into luxurious vegetable-tanned leather and thin scrolls of parchment, leaving with armfuls of material samples for experimentation. “It was an intense experience for some,” notes Canada. “Many were surprised by the strong scents that waft throughout the tannery. You can't mistake the smell of flesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct physical exposure to the tanning process yielded such eye-opening results as a pair of shredded leather pants&lt;strong&gt; Ying Bonny Cai 18 FS&lt;/strong&gt; stained with her own blood. The nude-colored garment reveals her affinity for the scars on her legs acquired while playing outdoors – and also her mother’s disgust at these wounds on her child. “To me, my scars embody the ability of my skin to absorb impact,” Cai says. “However, to my mother, these wounds are disturbing signs of how I’ve mistreated the pure body she gave me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeply moved by &lt;em&gt;Scars of Beating Gordon (Louisiana 1856)&lt;/em&gt;, an iconic photograph of a freed slave with ghastly scar tissue on his back,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fred Mezidor 16 AP&lt;/strong&gt; made a powerful garment titled &lt;em&gt;Ready-to-Wear Slave.&lt;/em&gt; The brown leather vest is accented with hydraulic metal and leather braiding meant to signify whips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Black culture is exploited for its ‘coolness’ when deemed acceptable by dominant institutions, but black people don’t receive credit as originators or innovators,” explains Mezidor, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Apparel Design at RISD and Modern Culture and Media at Brown. “This piece showcases the part of history that’s ever-present yet conveniently ignored when one parades in a skin and culture that’s not their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow Patamon Khoman 15 AP&lt;/strong&gt; also didn’t shy away from visceral concepts in creating &lt;em&gt;Memento&lt;/em&gt;, a translucent neckpiece made from silicon, with small black pearls used as buttons. When worn it makes the skin underneath look light purple, as if it’s healing from an injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bruises often become associated with violence – but sometimes they may be caused by genuine acts of affection,’ writes Khoman in her artist’s statement. “I want these pieces to invoke a sense of sentimentality. Rather than being covered, these marks are cherished.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Go Eat Worms!&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-01-29&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Chloedetail1.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL searches for silkworms, crickets and waterbugs at Narine Market, a local Asian shop that stocks edible insects.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;!--StartFragment--&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a near-freezing afternoon in January, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://chloebulpin.com/" title="Chloé Bulpin 15 IL" target="_blank"&gt;Chloé Bulpin 15 IL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the street signs she’s driving past in Olneyville, a boisterous Providence neighborhood filled with bumper-to-bumper traffic and pedestrians shuffling bags of fresh produce. The senior’s eyes light up when an unmarked storefront snaps into view. According to Google Maps, we’ve reached Narine Market, an Asian shop known for its stock of exotic edible insects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a shred of hesitation, Bulpin enters the busy store and deftly moves to the area where employees process new shipments. A butcher watches nonchalantly as she digs into an unmarked cardboard box to pull out packets of frozen crickets. “It’s almost impossible to find these types of treats anywhere else,” she explains while examining the large brown bugs. “Usually I have to order online from a vendor in Thailand. I’m still waiting on a package of scorpions to come in the mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin was doing some extra grocery shopping to prepare for &lt;a href="http://www.thebugbanquet.com/" title="The Bug Banquet" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ongoing project that grew out of an extensive independent study of the benefits of eating insects. With the help of &lt;strong&gt;Alex Gandarillas&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Matt Kominsky&lt;/strong&gt;, who are majoring in culinary arts at &lt;a href="https://www.jwu.edu/" title="Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Wales University" target="_blank"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Wales University&lt;/a&gt;, Bulpin whips up delicious pan-tossed crickets, Korean-style marinated silkworms and waterbug balls. At her first dinner party in November, guests quickly devoured the creepy-crawly dishes, which are packed with protein, iron, magnesium, calcium and essential fatty acids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My project forces people to confront their unfounded fears surrounding entomophagy – the custom of eating bugs,” Bulpin explains. “It’s been estimated that 80% of the world’s population already consumes insects on a daily basis. I'm hoping to redefine the parameters of Western food through education and the art of presentation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin (who bears a resemblance to British actress &lt;strong&gt;Keira Knightley&lt;/strong&gt;) was first introduced to the nutritional benefits of entomophagy while taking &lt;em&gt;The Art of Communicating Science,&lt;/em&gt; a recurring studio taught by Lecturer &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/departments/HPSS/Faculty/Profiles/Lucy%20Spelman/" title="Lucy Spelman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lucy Spelman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in conjunction with various faculty members in Illustration. As part of an independent study project last year, she began working on a cookbook full of tasty, bug-based recipes. But as she pondered consumer behavior patterns in the US and elsewhere in the developed world, she decided to launch a more intensive project designed to facilitate conversation and squash squeamishness about eating insects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Food is a highly sensory experience,” Bulpin points out. “In order to convince anyone of the intellectual merits surrounding insect-eating, I had to get people directly involved – one bite at a time. And I’ve found that people are apt to eat almost anything, especially if the insects are ground into flour or hidden in a pizza topping.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the health benefits, there are plenty of other good reasons to nibble on a handful of baked termites. According to a 2013 report published by the &lt;a href="http://www.fao.org/home/en/" title="Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations" target="_blank"&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, world population will grow from just over 7 billion people this year to 9 billion by 2050. Current food production will need to double in order to feed this growing population. Given the risks of overfishing oceans or cultivating diminishing tracts of land, mass farming of edible insects has long been championed as among the most viable solutions to this complex global problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compared to beef and poultry, [insects] are much cheaper to produce,” explains Bulpin. “They reproduce rapidly and require less feed and water. They also bulk up faster because they are poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and need fewer calories than warm-blooded livestock.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulpin intends to invite her peers on another gastronomical adventure when she hosts at dinner at the RISD President’s House in March. “Moving forward my goal is simply to present insects as a food choice that could successfully alleviate stress on the earth’s limited resources,” she explains. “Given the positive reactions at the &lt;em&gt;Bug Banquet&lt;/em&gt;, I’m hopeful that people will reconsider this sustainable, economically viable, nutritional, culturally rich – and frankly, very tasty – food.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Design Up Close&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-11&lt;/date&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14, Halima Johnson 08 ID and Michelle Cheng MA 10 focus on design education at the recently reopened Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the recent reopening of the &lt;a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org" title="Cooper Hewitt" target="_blank"&gt;Cooper Hewitt&lt;/a&gt; and its accompanying name change to the Smithsonian Design Museum, the focus has shifted more toward education and community outreach, with the goal of serving a much wider audience than ever before. The museum on Manhattan’s upper East Side has become a mecca for visitors from across the country and around the world – a place where those interested in experiencing design up close can temporarily step into the role of designer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the museum was closed for renovations [from 2011 to 2014], it gave us the chance to rethink the collection and how we want to present design to the world,” says Youth Programs Manager &lt;strong&gt;Halima Johnson 08 ID&lt;/strong&gt;. “We envisioned a collection that was accessible and relevant not just for our core audience of design enthusiasts, but also for tourists, families and especially students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one of three RISD alumni working to make that vision a reality, Johnson continues to adjust and improve upon the museum’s educational programs. Her new colleague &lt;strong&gt;Kameko Branchaud MA 14&lt;/strong&gt;, who joined the team last summer, focuses on programs for toddlers and kids in the 5–12 age range, while Professional Development Manager &lt;strong&gt;Michelle Cheng MA 10&lt;/strong&gt; heads up the &lt;a href="http://www.designthinkinginschools.com/directory/smithsonian-design-institute-by-cooper-hewitt-national-design-museum/" title="Smithsonian Design Institute" target="_blank"&gt;Smithsonian Design Institute&lt;/a&gt; (SDI), which works with school teachers from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re really focused on design process and design thinking, not just on looking at objects,” Cheng explains. “How do designers work? And how does that work connect to the common core standard?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Educators from a wide range of disciplines are introduced to the way designers think and are then encouraged to adapt the tools they’re given to suit their own school’s environment and curriculum. “And now that the museum has reopened,” adds Cheng, “we’re able to conduct on-site workshops that showcase our collection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud is helping to drive family programs like &lt;em&gt;Design Tales&lt;/em&gt;, a Target-funded literacy offering for preschoolers. “It’s a free program run by educators,” she explains. “We also get guest designers – like lighting maker and RISD alum &lt;a href="http://www.lindseyadelman.com" title="Lindsey Adelman 96 ID" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lindsey Adelman 96 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – to run hands-on workshops.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three women are passionate about art education and grateful for the many opportunities they were able to take advantage of at RISD. While Johnson majored in &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/" title="Industrial Design" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Design&lt;/a&gt; as an undergraduate, Cheng and Branchaud were both focused on learning to teach through the &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/tlad/" title="Teaching + Learning in Art + Design" target="_blank"&gt;Teaching + Learning in Art + Design&lt;/a&gt; (TLAD) graduate program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I completed TLAD’s two-year museum education track, which allowed me to take what I learned in the first year of classes and put it to work during my second year in various work situations,” says Cheng. She worked for the Providence Preservation Society and the &lt;a href="http://risdmuseum.org" title="RISD Museum" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Museum&lt;/a&gt;, taught an art history class at RISD and tutored at the &lt;a href="http://risdwritingcenter.com" title="Writing Center" target="_blank"&gt;Writing Center&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheng has made good use of those skills since earning her MA, first at the &lt;a href="http://newhavenmuseum.org/" title="New Haven Museum" target="_blank"&gt;New Haven Museum&lt;/a&gt; and now at the Cooper Hewitt. “I came in with experience creating a curriculum, working with kids and docents, and interpreting objects for a larger audience,” she notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branchaud’s RISD experiences include a Wintersession internship at the Providence art collective &lt;a href="http://www.as220.org" title="AS220" target="_blank"&gt;AS220&lt;/a&gt; and work with TLAD’s &lt;a href="http://risdprojectopendoor.com" title="Project Open Door" target="_blank"&gt;Project Open Door&lt;/a&gt; program for talented, low-income high school students. After winning a grant from Graduate Studies, she was able to travel to Guam last summer to head up a community mural project. “Nothing went as planned,” she recalls with a laugh. “That experience really helped me to realize that I wanted the stability (and resources) of a museum job.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Johnson has always known that design, education and museums would somehow figure into her career. “I have a long history with the Cooper Hewitt,” she explains. “The programs I participated in here as a teenager had a huge impact on me. That’s how I became interested in RISD in the first place. Coming to work here in design education has completed a very large circle for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Yelitsa Jean-Charles 16 IL meets with Michael Carabetta, creative director at Chronicle Books. | photo by Jo Sittenfeld MFA 08 PH&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards.

&lt;p&gt;With a glowing tablet in hand, &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/kevinzma" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Ma 16 GD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; meets with &lt;a href="google.com" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; reps, eager to present a series of renderings that reimagine one of the oldest wings of the historic &lt;a href="http://www.provlib.org/" target="_blank"&gt;Providence Public Library&lt;/a&gt;. His interior design proposes that its slanted walls be painted in grey tones and lined with inspiring words by Welsh poet &lt;strong&gt;Dylan Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;. “The poetry would be set in a way that’s intriguing to the viewer and expressive of the poem’s personality,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google designer&lt;strong&gt; Jonathan Chung 11 GD&lt;/strong&gt; responds positively, praising Ma for carefully considering the elegant character of the space while developing his conceptual project. “I’m impressed with this forward-thinking design and the smart use of typography,” he notes while poring over the junior’s designs. “It’s clear that you understand how to systematically work through problems to come up with inventive solutions. We’re always on the look-out for this kind of talent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seated at a neighboring table, &lt;a href="http://www.kojiiii.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Koji Yamamoto 15 FAV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shares colorful character designs and a segment of his action-packed degree project animation with representatives from &lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/"&gt;Cartoon Network&lt;/a&gt;. Storyboard artist &lt;strong&gt;Megan Jo Nairn&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Emily Walus 12 IL&lt;/strong&gt; – a background artist for the television series &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/video/steven-universe/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steven Universe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; – show clear interest in his claymation and an illustration of a pair of adorably cranky men wearing bright spacesuits. “These guy have some attitude,” Nairn exclaims with a giggle. “And I see that you find humor in movement – which is what cartoons are all about!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial Design senior &lt;a href="http://portfolios.risd.edu/paulcbird" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paul Bird 15 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is excited to present his portfolio to designers from &lt;a href="http://richbrilliantwilling.com/" title="Rich Brilliant Willing," target="_blank"&gt;Rich Brilliant Willing,&lt;/a&gt; a wildly successful Brooklyn-based furniture design studio launched by three alumni in 2006 just as the economy was taking a nose-dive.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theo Richardson 06 FD&lt;/strong&gt;, director of development, expresses interest in &lt;em&gt;E’Block&lt;/em&gt;, a device Bird designed to track the amount of energy consumed by common household items. He asks the senior to follow up with him via email to discuss future possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In one afternoon, I met so many people with unique perspectives and insights to share,” Bird says with satisfaction following the event. “It was just such a privilege to build a dialogue and rapport with industry leaders from a wide range of sectors. It’s a rare opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a seat across the table, &lt;a href="http://pamelamchavez.com/" target="_blank" title="Pamela Chavez 15 IL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pamela Chavez 15 IL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;confidently unrolls a collection of painterly images used in creating &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/118101237" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roses for Wolves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, her enchanting stop-motion animation about a young woman who follows the guidance of a mystical spirit-wolf. As &lt;strong&gt;Alan Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, an art director at the LA- and NY-based motion graphics studio &lt;a href="http://www.imaginaryforces.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Imaginary Forces&lt;/a&gt;, flips through the portfolio, he pauses to inspect photos of her endearing wooden characters, replete with hand-stitched clothing and bits of wool and string for unruly hair.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This animation is simple and minimalistic – but there’s something raw and beautifully human that shines through,” Williams notes with a broad smile. “This attention to detail, love of storytelling and firm grasp on conceptual development is what we like to see when interviewing potential employees. So many RISD students have those skillsets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This positive exchange of ideas was just one of hundreds that took place at last week’s &lt;a href="http://risdcareers.com/designreview2015.html" target="_blank"&gt;Design Portfolio Review&lt;/a&gt;, a full-day networking event hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.risdcareers.com/" target="_blank"&gt;RISD’s Career Center&lt;/a&gt;. Clutching iPads, laptops and hardcover portfolios, more than 600 juniors, seniors and graduate students zipped around the Rhode Island Convention Center to make invaluable professional connections with representatives from approximately 140 high-profile companies – including &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/" title="Apple" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.chroniclebooks.com/" title="Chronicle Books" target="_blank"&gt;Chronicle Books&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.converse.com/" title="Converse" target="_blank"&gt;Converse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://davidstarkdesign.com/" title="David Stark Design" target="_blank"&gt;David Stark Design&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/" title="Herman Miller" target="_blank"&gt;Herman Miller&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.pollackassociates.com/" title="Pollack Fabrics" target="_blank"&gt;Pollack Fabrics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.ramsa.com/en/index.html" title="Robert AM Stern Architects" target="_blank"&gt;Robert AM Stern Architects&lt;/a&gt;, among many others. Carefully selected based on the quality of the company and the type of positions they offer, these experts give students feedback on their work, pointed advice on how to enhance their interview skills and fresh perspectives on the current job market. Some even offer full-time jobs by the end of the first meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This day is all about forging long-lasting relationships that can potentially lead to promising opportunities,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Susan Andersen&lt;/strong&gt;, associate director of the Career Center. “We always encourage students to apply electronically to interesting jobs listed on Internet career boards.

&lt;caption&gt;Panelist Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX showed the infamous 16th-century RHINOCEROS woodcut Albrecht Dürer created based on a written description of the actual beast as an early example of an interface gone wrong.&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparing this idea to the analogue notion of jigs and fixtures, Holman joked that she’s sometimes more enamored with the jigs she makes than the objects they’re designed to help fabricate. Digital + Media Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/digital-media/faculty/Evelyn-Eastmond/" title="Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evelyn Eastmond MFA 12 DM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;– a former software engineer who only recently began working non-digitally – noted how critical that kind of ingenuity is at RISD. But Hodgin pointed out the downside: getting distracted from his real goals by the tools he needs to make in order to reach them. “It’s like a painter who gets obsessed with creating the perfect brush and never gets any paint on the canvas,” he quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panelists agreed that some tools and interfaces completely change the user’s way of thinking. For Cardini, the entire premise of open-source design and unlimited online resources has turned his process on its head. And Hagan said that the visual quality of Nodebox freeware “spoke [his] language and shaped [his] imagination in new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holman suggested that regardless of the tools used, the role of the designer is fundamentally changing to that of “meta-designer,” with the end-user in effect becoming the designer. Her goal, she said, is to create designs that set people up for success. “And I never want to include instructions,” she added, noting that “if the client can’t figure out how to use it, I’ve failed as a designer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third and final installment of&lt;/em&gt; tool ( ) &lt;em&gt;is scheduled for April 15–16 and will include a multidisciplinary discussion on&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/place-applications-implications/" title="Place: Applications/Implications" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Place: Applications/Implications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;This spring’s multidisciplinary &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org" title="tool ( )" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; forum – conceived by Architecture Critic &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/architecture/faculty/Joy-Ko/" title="Joy Ko" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joy Ko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with four departments and the &lt;a href="http://www.risdcodestudio.org/" title="RISD Code Studio" target="_blank"&gt;RISD Code Studio&lt;/a&gt; – continued last week with the second of three open discussions designed to take stock of a range of digital and analogue tools used in creative practice today. Through focused sessions in February, March and April, &lt;em&gt;tool ( )&lt;/em&gt; is bringing together “practitioners pushing the frontier of current modes of artistic and design production, students and academics who integrate learning and teaching with tool-making, and industry players who are developing these tools of trade for widespread use,” Ko explains on the forum site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series began in late February with a discussion centered on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/artisan-toolmaker/" title="Artisan-Toolmaker" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Artisan-Toolmaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, asking participants to consider the most meaningful, novel, strange or provocative tools they use or only dream about using. Last week’s session on &lt;a href="http://risdtool.org/category/interfaces-imagination/" title="Interfaces&amp;amp;lt;-&amp;amp;gt;Imagination" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interfaces&amp;lt;-&amp;gt;Imagination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – moderated by Assistant Professor of Textiles &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/textiles/faculty/Brooks-Hagan/" title="Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooks Hagan MFA 02 TX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; – brought together several RISD faculty members, 3D printing expert &lt;strong&gt;Duann Scott&lt;/strong&gt; (who runs the NYC-based consultancy &lt;a href="http://www.shapeways.com/shops/bits2atoms" title="Bits to Atoms" target="_blank"&gt;Bits to Atoms&lt;/a&gt;) and visiting artist/coder &lt;a href="http://roberthodgin.com/" title="Robert Hodgin 98 SC" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Hodgin 98 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who also presented a talk on his groundbreaking digital designs the following evening. Panelists were asked to consider the changing role of interfaces in the world of digital design and how notions of transparency and crowd-sourcing have played into their own creative practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ko kicked off the conversation by noting that the interface-imagination relationship goes two ways and postulated that most users would describe the best interfaces as “seamless” or “frictionless.” While Hodgin immediately concurred, noting that he only notices interfaces when they disappoint him, other panelists disagreed. “A proper interface &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; introduce a little friction,” Associate Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Paolo-Cardini/" title="Paolo Cardini" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paolo Cardini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; maintained, “in order to reflect the relationship between the designer and the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Professor of Industrial Design &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/industrial-design/faculty/Cas-Holman/" title="Cas Holman" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cas Holman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that in the quickly evolving world of digital design, that relationship is in flux. And Scott agreed, noting, “I meet with designers regularly to see how they’re using digital tools and how interfaces can change to meet their needs. The best designers I know are creating their &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; interfaces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISD’s &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/students/diversity/mlk-series/#.VIHHNWTF9JE" title="2015 MLK Series"&gt;2015 MLK Series&lt;/a&gt;, an annual tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gets underway this Saturday with an opening dinner and concert by the local Prism of Praise Community Gospel Choir. The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2015-02-24&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;image&gt;/uploadedImages/RISD_edu/about/news/stories/2015/Sculpture-detail.jpg&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Students in the IRON IN WINTER Sculpture studio work outdoors with molten metal during a full-day "iron pour.”&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;body&gt;&lt;p&gt;Feet firmly planted in a swirl of glittering sparks, a group of students wearing leather jackets and face shields remains focused while working outdoors in the bitter cold behind the Metcalf Building. They’re ladling scoops of molten-hot metal into molds during a full-day “iron pour” – part of the Wintersession &lt;a href="http://risd.edu/academics/sculpture/" target="_blank"&gt;Sculpture&lt;/a&gt; studio &lt;em&gt;Iron in Winter&lt;/em&gt;. Even as some of the vessels erupt into flames, they soldier on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Molds made from wood and other experimental substances&lt;em&gt; feel&lt;/em&gt; dry to the touch but there’s water trapped in those organic materials,” explains faculty member &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/academics/sculpture/faculty/Christopher-Sancomb/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chris Sancomb 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who taught the course with &lt;strong&gt;Megan Tamas MFA 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;. “So when 3,000-degree iron hits [the molds], the moisture rapidly turns to steam – which desperately wants to escape into the air. That’s the physics behind those loud pops and shooting sparks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, a ceramic liner in one of the buckets melts away, allowing liquid iron to seep onto the ground. Remembering what they’ve been taught, students pour sand on the molten metal while an especially handy student runs up to the Hot Shop to repair the defective container. In less than 15 minutes, he returns with the bucket – almost as good as new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was a heart-pounding moment when the iron escaped,” explains &lt;a href="http://jennyrachelsparks.com/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jenny Rachel Sparks 15 SC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://risd.brown.edu/" target="_blank"&gt;Brown-RISD Dual Degree&lt;/a&gt; student who’s majoring in Sculpture at RISD and Geology at Brown. “Fortunately, we rehearsed an action plan in case something like this should happen. We kept calm and pushed on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near the end of the day, two female students race up to the third floor of the Metcalf Building, crack open a window and lower a hose to the ground. “Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your long hose,” quips one spectator as other students grab the end of the hose and turn on the water to extinguish the smoking furnace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the iron pour is the most dramatic part of the studio, students also learned a lot more about the process during the five-week crash course in ironworking. Weeks earlier they made small molds out of ceramic composites, wood and dried mud, hollowing out cavities in the shapes desired. They pounded on old iron radiators and bathtubs with sledgehammers to break them into baseball-sized pieces that were then loaded into the “cupola” – a homemade blast furnace heated with coke, which is derived from coal but has minimal impurities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is my first time holding a sledgehammer,” explains &lt;strong&gt;Alessia Arregui 15 GL&lt;/strong&gt; as she crushes a neat pile of metal with the heavy tool. “It’s been a treat to explore the strengths and limitations of iron while participating in such a labor-intensive studio.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early February, students cracked open their molds to unearth a diverse collection of captivating metalwork. Wisconsin native &lt;strong&gt;Joe Fellows 16 SC&lt;/strong&gt; made a collection of foot-long fish he’ll incorporate into ongoing three-dimensional projects inspired by bodies of water and tidal patterns. He made his molds using large herring preserved in formaldehyde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also moved by natural wonders, Sparks made a pair of bulky doorknobs she'll use as props when directing photoshoots in the depths of New England forests. “I imagine these pieces will represent humans’ desire to access and control forces of nature,” she explains. “To me it’s beautiful to see fine metalwork and the outdoors come together.”&lt;/p&gt;

The series of events continues on Monday, January 19 – the national holiday dedicated to remembering King and everything he stood for - as students and other members of the RISD community come together at the Martin Luther King, Jr. Elementary School in Providence for the annual &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_day_of_service_3676#.VK_wNWTF_hF" title="MLK Day of Service" target="_blank"&gt;MLK Day of Service&lt;/a&gt;. Acclaimed actor, producer and humanitarian &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/templates/content.aspx?id=6442459879"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Danny Glover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; brings the 11-day celebration to a memorable close on Friday, January 30 when he presents the &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/mlk_series_keynote_danny_glover#.VLBLexaIC26" title="2015 MLK Series keynote address" target="_blank"&gt;2015 MLK Series keynote address&lt;/a&gt; in the RISD Auditorium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our annual Martin Luther King, Jr. series has become a moment in the year when our campus community retreats and refuels,” notes &lt;strong&gt;Tony Johnson 93 SC&lt;/strong&gt;, director of &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/Students/Diversity/Multicultural_Affairs/"&gt;Intercultural Student Engagement&lt;/a&gt; and one of the key organizers behind the MLK events. “It’s especially timely this year given recent national events that have reignited our collective awareness about justice, peace and equity – themes critical to the work and legacy of Dr. King and so many others before him. We want to empower students with a personal sense of urgency and agency – to show them that the future can be designed by them and that as artists they have invaluable tools to address and eradicate injustice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover, who is best known for his roles in big Hollywood productions such as &lt;em&gt;Witness&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt; and the blockbuster &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon&lt;/em&gt; series, will speak about &lt;em&gt;Creativity and Democracy: Social Change Through the Arts&lt;/em&gt;. The actor, director and producer is perhaps less known for the philanthropic and humanitarian work that has been a constant throughout his career – from his early life as a student activist and community developer to his more recent activities centered around advocacy for economic justice and universal access to health care and education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glover has earned Emmy nominations for his performance in the title role in the HBO movie &lt;em&gt;Mandela&lt;/em&gt; and his work in the acclaimed miniseries &lt;em&gt;Lonesome Dove&lt;/em&gt;, and recently co-starred in the popular TV series &lt;em&gt;Touch&lt;/em&gt;. As co-founder of &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.louverturefilms.com/ss/home" title="Louverture Films" target="_blank"&gt;Louverture Films&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in NYC, he is also dedicated to producing feature and documentary films of historic relevance, social impact and artistic integrity, such as &lt;em&gt;Bamako, The House I Live In&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Concerning Violence&lt;/em&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading up to Glover’s talk, &lt;a href="https://events.risd.edu/event/rhythm_change_a_danny_glover_film_series#.VK_z5GTF_hF" title="Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Change: A Danny Glover Film Series&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; features three films produced by Louverture: &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/BlackPowerMixtape" title="The&amp;amp;nbsp;Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.troublethewaterfilm.com/" title="Trouble the Water" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trouble the Water&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.soundtrackforarevolutionfilm.com/Home.html" title="Soundtrack for a Revolution" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soundtrack for a Revolution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The latter screening will be followed by a faculty-led panel discussion about the role music and the arts play in social change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Danny Glover’s life and work demonstrate how art can be a platform for conveying complex ideas, confronting injustice and advancing culture,” notes Interim President &lt;a href="http://www.risd.edu/about/president/rosanne-somerson/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rosanne Somerson 76 ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This resonates for us at RISD, honoring our core mission. We are delighted to welcome Mr. Glover to Providence.”&lt;/p&gt;
