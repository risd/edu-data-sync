The senior made the pleated skirts and collared tank tops using a combination of flexible fabrics with a subtle sparkle.

Specifically, the collection was inspired by his fascination with online communities that act out fetishes using Internet avatars.</p>\r\n<p>&ldquo;For a lot of people, these rendered women can successfully incite human emotions,\" the artist explains. &ldquo;And that can look a lot like love.&rdquo;</p>","is_current_item":true,"is_root_item":true}],"photoset_layout":"22","photos":[{"caption":"Kevin Cochran 13 PR created All My Girlfriends, an exhibition now on display in RISD's Benson Hall Gallery.","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":956,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":373,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":299,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":187,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":75,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":956,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/3354a8316e817391a9d17bee354b4df9/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko2_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 4","ISO":160,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/15th","FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"Advait Thackur 14 ID and Lela Barclay De Tolly attended the exhibition's opening on Valentine's Day.","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1019,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":398,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":318,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":199,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":80,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1019,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/912f8fe6efad27ca043a6e2a020ba532/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 4","ISO":160,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/15th","FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"All My Girlfriends, an exhibition featuring images of sexy women.","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1246,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":487,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":389,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":243,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":97,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1246,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/c9dfb55ff5177ce6682ae6302e99d443/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko3_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 4","ISO":160,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/15th","FocalLength":"3mm"}},{"caption":"Kevin Cochran 13 PR stands next to Cassie, one of his six pieces.","alt_sizes":[{"width":1280,"height":1255,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_1280.jpg"},{"width":500,"height":490,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_500.jpg"},{"width":400,"height":392,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_400.jpg"},{"width":250,"height":245,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_250.jpg"},{"width":100,"height":98,"url":"http://40.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_100.jpg"},{"width":75,"height":75,"url":"http://36.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_75sq.jpg"}],"original_size":{"width":1280,"height":1255,"url":"http://41.media.tumblr.com/bff46b19f4002e84c693c910d780762c/tumblr_mi9xo7Ua8R1r8nqlko7_r1_1280.jpg"},"exif":{"Camera":" iPhone 4","ISO":160,"Aperture":"f/2.8","Exposure":"1/15th","FocalLength":"3mm"}}]}

The full story is posted <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Commencement_2012/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. I addressed the Class of 2012 with the following speech:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A warm welcome to everyone who has gathered here today to celebrate the Class of 2012 at the Rhode Island School of Design’s 129th Commencement ceremony. We have all looked forward to this day for a long time, and all of you here can be proud of this Class’ achievements. Welcome to members of RISD’s Board of Trustees, staff, alumni, curators, librarians, and our inspiring honorary degree recipients. Welcome to Congressman <strong>David</strong> <strong>Cicilline</strong>, President <strong>Xu Jiang</strong> of the China Academy of Art; <strong>Lorne Adrain</strong>, Chair of the Rhode Island Board of Governors of Higher Education; <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Lassonde</strong>, Deputy Dean of the College at Brown University; and <strong>Laurie</strong> <strong>White</strong>, President of the Providence Chamber of Commerce. And a special welcome and thanks go out to our faculty and parents, and all of those who have come along on your students’ transformative journeys as artists and designers. It’s an emotional day for all of us.</p>\n<p>Class of 2012, you and I began at RISD at the same time. It’s been a chaotic economic era for our world, and these bumps even managed to infiltrate many college campuses. But thanks to your passion and spirit, life on the RISD campus has truly flourished. You’ve doubled the number of student-led clubs and organizations in these four years, and this year we even managed to beat our Ivy League neighbor in flag football. We’ve also seen the rebirth of Carr Haus as a student-centered place to be on campus, which just a few weeks ago you dedicated to beloved English Professor <strong>Michael Fink</strong>. </p>\n<p>Like you, Class of 2012, I’ve been a student for these past four years, and like you, I bet I would barely recognize the person who set foot on campus in the Fall of 2008. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and have spent much of my life as a student myself, or learning from students as a teacher. When I have walked about campus and had a chance to chat with many of you here, I’ve always been inspired by your ability to relentlessly and boldly experiment — or, as <strong>Rocco Landesman</strong> of the National Endowment for the Arts says, to “productively fail.” </p>\n<p>Rocco put it so well, but you know who put it even better? Thomas Wayne.

I&nbsp;addressed the Class of 2012 with the following speech:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A warm welcome to everyone who has gathered here today to celebrate the Class of 2012 at the Rhode Island School of Design&rsquo;s 129th Commencement ceremony. We have all looked forward to this day for a long time, and all of you here can be proud of this Class&rsquo; achievements. Welcome to members of RISD&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, staff, alumni, curators, librarians, and our inspiring honorary degree recipients. Welcome to Congressman <strong>David</strong> <strong>Cicilline</strong>, President <strong>Xu Jiang</strong> of the China Academy of Art; <strong>Lorne Adrain</strong>, Chair of the Rhode Island Board of Governors of Higher Education; <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Lassonde</strong>, Deputy Dean of the College at Brown University; and <strong>Laurie</strong> <strong>White</strong>, President of the Providence Chamber of Commerce. And a special welcome and thanks go out to our faculty and parents, and all of those who have come along on your students&rsquo; transformative journeys as artists and designers. It&rsquo;s an emotional day for all of us.</p>\n<p>Class of 2012, you and I began at RISD at the same time. It&rsquo;s been a chaotic economic era for our world, and these bumps even managed to infiltrate many college campuses. But thanks to your passion and spirit, life on the RISD campus has truly flourished. You&rsquo;ve doubled the number of student-led clubs and organizations in these four years, and this year we even managed to beat our Ivy League neighbor in flag football. We&rsquo;ve also seen the rebirth of Carr Haus as a student-centered place to be on campus, which just a few weeks ago you dedicated to beloved English Professor <strong>Michael Fink</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Like you, Class of 2012, I&rsquo;ve been a student for these past four years, and like you, I bet I would barely recognize the person who set foot on campus in the Fall of 2008. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and have spent much of my life as a student myself, or learning from students as a teacher. When I have walked about campus and had a chance to chat with many of you here, I&rsquo;ve always been inspired by your ability to relentlessly and boldly experiment &mdash; or, as <strong>Rocco Landesman</strong> of the National Endowment for the Arts says, to &ldquo;productively fail.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rocco put it so well, but you know who put it even better? Thomas Wayne. You may remember him from the powerful moment he shared with his young son, Bruce Wayne, in the motion picture, &ldquo;Batman Begins.&rdquo; While playing on his family&rsquo;s estate, young Bruce accidentally falls into a deep, narrow well, with no ability to escape. He is later rescued by his father, Thomas. Unsettled and disoriented, the rescued Bruce asks his father, &ldquo;Why do we fall, father?&rdquo; Thomas looks in his son&rsquo;s eyes with compassion and love and says, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTWjtnKv4vE\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;So we can learn to pick ourselves up.&rdquo;</a> And later, his last parting words to his child, who would some day become Batman, are, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Bruce.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you have learned one thing here at RISD, it&rsquo;s not to be afraid. Along with your teachers and parents, I have watched you take risks in your work and find your voice here at RISD as thinkers and makers. I have seen the important fruits of this labor, whether it be a musical to support disaster relief, or a necklace that weighs less than a feather, or a poster that transforms public health policy, or a garment that drapes like a second skin, or a movie about a counterculture hero, or a garden that welcomes community members in growth and liberty.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I have found my voice as a leader, and like any artist and designer, I have tried to make sure I led RISD to take some risks.

The full story is posted <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Commencement_2012/\">here</a>. I&nbsp;addressed the Class of 2012 with the following speech:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>A warm welcome to everyone who has gathered here today to celebrate the Class of 2012 at the Rhode Island School of Design&rsquo;s 129th Commencement ceremony. We have all looked forward to this day for a long time, and all of you here can be proud of this Class&rsquo; achievements. Welcome to members of RISD&rsquo;s Board of Trustees, staff, alumni, curators, librarians, and our inspiring honorary degree recipients. Welcome to Congressman <strong>David</strong> <strong>Cicilline</strong>, President <strong>Xu Jiang</strong> of the China Academy of Art; <strong>Lorne Adrain</strong>, Chair of the Rhode Island Board of Governors of Higher Education; <strong>Stephen</strong> <strong>Lassonde</strong>, Deputy Dean of the College at Brown University; and <strong>Laurie</strong> <strong>White</strong>, President of the Providence Chamber of Commerce. And a special welcome and thanks go out to our faculty and parents, and all of those who have come along on your students&rsquo; transformative journeys as artists and designers. It&rsquo;s an emotional day for all of us.</p>\r\n<p>Class of 2012, you and I began at RISD at the same time. It&rsquo;s been a chaotic economic era for our world, and these bumps even managed to infiltrate many college campuses. But thanks to your passion and spirit, life on the RISD campus has truly flourished. You&rsquo;ve doubled the number of student-led clubs and organizations in these four years, and this year we even managed to beat our Ivy League neighbor in flag football. We&rsquo;ve also seen the rebirth of Carr Haus as a student-centered place to be on campus, which just a few weeks ago you dedicated to beloved English Professor <strong>Michael Fink</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Like you, Class of 2012, I&rsquo;ve been a student for these past four years, and like you, I bet I would barely recognize the person who set foot on campus in the Fall of 2008. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and have spent much of my life as a student myself, or learning from students as a teacher. When I have walked about campus and had a chance to chat with many of you here, I&rsquo;ve always been inspired by your ability to relentlessly and boldly experiment &mdash; or, as <strong>Rocco Landesman</strong> of the National Endowment for the Arts says, to &ldquo;productively fail.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Rocco put it so well, but you know who put it even better? Thomas Wayne. You may remember him from the powerful moment he shared with his young son, Bruce Wayne, in the motion picture, &ldquo;Batman Begins.&rdquo; While playing on his family&rsquo;s estate, young Bruce accidentally falls into a deep, narrow well, with no ability to escape. He is later rescued by his father, Thomas. Unsettled and disoriented, the rescued Bruce asks his father, &ldquo;Why do we fall, father?&rdquo; Thomas looks in his son&rsquo;s eyes with compassion and love and says, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTWjtnKv4vE\">\"So we can learn to pick ourselves up.&rdquo;</a> And later, his last parting words to his child, who would some day become Batman, are, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Bruce.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you have learned one thing here at RISD, it&rsquo;s not to be afraid. Along with your teachers and parents, I have watched you take risks in your work and find your voice here at RISD as thinkers and makers. I have seen the important fruits of this labor, whether it be a musical to support disaster relief, or a necklace that weighs less than a feather, or a poster that transforms public health policy, or a garment that drapes like a second skin, or a movie about a counterculture hero, or a garden that welcomes community members in growth and liberty.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, I have found my voice as a leader, and like any artist and designer, I have tried to make sure I led RISD to take some risks. Things like changing to Gmail and Google Apps early on, or introducing the Square payment device to graduating seniors, or making sure we were active on <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/blog/en/2011/etsy-congratulates-risd-grads/\">Etsy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/pages/RISD\">Kickstarter</a>, or teaching <a href=\"http://processing.org\">Processing</a> in the Foundation Studies classes &ndash; these are innovations that at the beginning seemed risky, or unnecessary, but are beginning to seem more commonplace. Thanks to our collective efforts, RISD remains a symbolic beacon for fearless, creative thinkers who dare to &ldquo;productively fail.&rdquo;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Throughout these four years, we have both found teachers who have truly inspired us and changed our world-views. One of my favorite moments of this ceremony every year is when RISD faculty are honored with RISD&rsquo;s highest teaching award, the Frazier Award. In many ways, this is RISD&rsquo;s greatest honor &ndash; for teaching is our highest value, and what&rsquo;s more, the recipients are selected by our students, faculty, and staff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In today&rsquo;s world, as we strive to adapt to the curving, &ldquo;jagged&rdquo; paths of our professional pursuits, we encounter teachers at all ages and in all forms. They can come to us through an intense studio course, a mentor on the job, or a three-minute video online. This year I happened upon a teacher, Professor <strong>Marshall Ganz</strong>, at a course for nonprofit leaders at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government. Ganz is an expert in grassroots organizing who lectures about what inspires people to act and to make change in the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>He says that moving people to action is about telling stories, and that our stories are formed by three ways of knowing. The three ways of knowing are: knowing with the head, knowing with the hands, and knowing with the heart. The head, he says, is how most of the world operates. It&rsquo;s a cognitive, logical perspective that drives us to identify what things are, literally. I think most of us here at RISD have had the feeling that sometimes the world goes too far in the direction of the head, and it&rsquo;s how we sometimes get into trouble.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The heart is what attaches values to things, what gives them meaning, what gives us a feeling. It&rsquo;s the part that artists and designers have an acute awareness of, better than anyone in the world. And according to Ganz, it&rsquo;s the part that really drives us to action. We are only truly moved to act when we make an emotional commitment to something that we care about.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Which brings us to the hands. The hands are our most advanced tools for making, and our RISD education shows us that they are also tools for thinking. Ganz says, &ldquo;For the hands to be engaged fruitfully, they need both the head and the heart.&rdquo; In other words, the best making is fueled by questions from the head and passion from the heart.</p>\r\n<p>Above all, the hands are how we act, enact, bring to action, activate. Everyone bear with me and hold your hands up in front of you. You can tell RISD students&rsquo; hands have seen a lot of action. And we like the fact that many of you have kept all of your fingers. They are the hands of work. Thoughtful work. Critical work. Critical making. They are torn up, beat up, and have the battle scars &ndash; and charcoal stains &ndash; to prove it. Your hands have spent these four years devotedly making &ndash; critically making &nbsp; &ndash; and these dirty hands form the basis of your practiced power as you enter the world beyond RISD.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Ganz also says, &ldquo;Young people come of age with a critical eye and &ndash; almost of necessity &ndash; hopeful hearts. That&rsquo;s why young people are often associated with movements for change.&rdquo; This year saw the first-ever student leaders&rsquo; dinner, celebrating the many different homegrown efforts happening on campus. From an alternative spring break project that helped clean up an abandoned local synagogue, to a roving food truck art gallery called Radish, to the <a href=\"http://www.makebigdreams.com/\">Make Big Dreams Expo</a> where students formed a community of support for entrepreneurial pursuits &mdash;&nbsp;or as we say at RISD, <a href=\"http://www.risd.edu/About/News/Empowering_Enterprise.aspx\">&ldquo;art-repreneurship&rdquo;</a> &mdash; your ability to act with both intention and emotion is exceptional.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Nowhere that I&rsquo;ve seen in the world embodies the combination of the head, hands, and heart better than RISD. And no students are better prepared to make change in the world than RISD students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It is a special pleasure each year to welcome our honorary degree recipients to campus and show them a bit of what RISD is about. This year, I am especially honored to welcome <strong>Rebecca Solnit</strong>, <strong>Wang Shu</strong>, and <strong>Studio</strong> <strong>Ghibli</strong>. Yes, we all love Totoro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I was speaking in China and Korea last week where I felt the immense creative energy and economic momentum that fills the Asian air now. Our global creative climate is vast, and the fact that two of our honorees would come from Asia is unprecedented and especially relevant to our times. Growing up here in the U.S. as an Asian-American, teachers told me I was good at art, and good at math. And my father would always tell people &ldquo;My son is good at math.&rdquo; Even after going on to earn a PhD in design in Japan, I personally encountered much of the skepticism and stereotypes that beset Asian creativity &ndash; the belief of that we tend towards &ldquo;copy cat&rdquo; culture and a lack of originality. Our honorees from Asia today, <strong>Xu Jiang</strong>, <strong>Wang Shu</strong> and <strong>Studio Ghibli</strong>, show how misguided these assumptions are, and set a high standard for all to emulate. We must embrace influences from the world over. We also must welcome students from backgrounds of all kinds, which is why I am so committed to raising funds for scholarships, and am pleased that we had a record-setting year in this regard.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Class of 2012, you are local and global citizens &mdash; &ldquo;glocal&rdquo; citizens &mdash; who act in ways that move the hands, minds, and hearts of the world. I knew this from the very moment when I met the incoming class of 2012.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>RISD is the art and design school by which all others are measured, and it is you, the Class of 2012, that make it worthy of its reputation. The entire world is waking up to the fact that art and design will drive economic development in the 21st century like science and technology did in the 20th century.
