As a woman working in a historically male-centric industry and sport, Digit will share the real world techniques that she has utilized to move forward, generate success, and not get discouraged.  Her persistence and willingness to create civil controversy have provided her with essential skills around understanding personal context in order to adaptively move toward success.  Attendees will leave this session with a better understanding of why it is important to avoid “tunnel vision” and constricting roles so that they can see the big picture and adapt to meet new circumstances.  Students will be able to take Digit’s story of adapting her leadership styles to succeed in hostile or inequitable environments and apply it to any situation or challenge they face as leaders.\n\nFulfills - Inclusion/Diversity, Cultural, Operational\n\nWhile RISD LEADS is offered as a certificate program, Sessions are open to anyone who is interested.
