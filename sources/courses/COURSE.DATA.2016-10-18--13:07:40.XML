   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO BASIC SHOEMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Apparel Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ID 2494 for ID majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING CONSTRAINTS: AN INTRODUCTION TO PARAMETRIC DESIGN THROUGH MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Parametric design is the process of using algorithmic thinking to facilitate the formal expression of defined parameters. This process has become prevalent in architecture, object design, and many artist practices. This class will examine how the use of parametric design methods can inform the making process. By setting constraints, we are making important decisions about everything we create. Usually these decisions are cast in stone, but what happens when they are open for manipulation? We will be utilizing the algorithmic computer modeling program, Grasshopper, as well as more analogue processes. Using these methods, students will explore the field of parametric through designing and building with their own systems of making. Some of the tools used in this class will include, but not be limited to, 3D printers, pen plotter, plotter cutter and, of course, your hands. Computer modeling experience is preferred, but not required. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The class seeks to examine set design within a studio environment that is as close as possible to that of the profession, allowing students the opportunity to work on numerous productions in the design roles within theatre and opera.  Relevance will be attached to the exploration of visual solutions that are viscerally grounded in the text.  Script analysis will be thorough and ongoing.  Group participation in this process is essential.  Students will be expected to read and research one to two plays per week.  All sets will be modeled, with fluctuating levels of completion.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Architecture &amp; Design Majors Only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DSGN+ENTREPRENURIAL THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Entrepreneurship--the imagining, building and sustaining of socially impactful organizations--is a creative art. It requires insights and knowledge from the humanities and the social and physical sciences, and demands self-awareness and purpose. The premise of this lecture course is that designers and artists are uniquely gifted with critical entrepreneurial qualities. This course will allow students to better understand how and where their skills and perspectives fit into the world of entrepreneurship and business. The objective of Design and Entrepreneurial Thinking is for students to understand a basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities. This course seeks to educate students to recognize business as a critical design factor--a defining constraint or liberating perspective-along the same lines that other design principles are taught. This course will use Harvard Business School case notes, case studies, and recent  business books to highlight this thinking. Students will be introduced to basic business concepts through lectures, case studies, assignments and class discussion. Homework assignments will work off the classroom pedagogy. Topics covered will be business models, marketing, finance, and strategy. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WKSHP: DYNAMICS OF IDENTITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As designers-creatives who service a client-base-the work we produce can often feel lacking in personal identity and uniqueness. This course is set up as an intensive workshop format that provides contact with four distinguished visiting designers who will traverse a weekly series of thematic investigations related to identity and practice. Students will reflect on personal experiences and convictions that have shaped their work and examine the potential for these to further influence their creative process. Over the five-week span of Wintersession, students will participate in one or more 1 credit sessions. The weekly threads we have outlined are: Dynamics of Identity, Ethical Identity, Politics of Identity, and Passionate Design. Participation in the first introductory workshop session-Dynamics of  Identity-is strongly recommended to lay the groundwork for the subsequent weekly workshops. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;      Each workshop spans 2 ½ days (20 hours), launching with a Friday evening guest lecture/round table discussion 6:00PM to 9:00pm with selected faculty, alums and guests. The following Saturday and Sunday, students will engage in a studio led by the visiting designer ending with a closing critique on Sunday afternoon. 9:00AM to 5:30PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;   Week 1: Jan 6 to Jan 13 Dynamics of Identity &lt;br&gt; Week 2: Jan 13 to Jan 15 Passionate Design&lt;br&gt; Week 3: Jan 20 to Jan 22 Ethical Identity&lt;br&gt; Week 4: Jan 27 to Jan 29 Politics of Identity&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ITALY: SHOE DESIGN PERCEPTION, HISTORY &amp; PROTOTYPING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Italy Wintersession Shoe Design &amp; Prototyping travel course interlaces Apparel and Automotive Design studies grown from the culture and creative muse of Italy. This introspective and shared investigation evokes both industries' design arenas and thoroughly explores the process of shoe development from shared perspectives. Students will participate in journal based self - study explorations throughout the course in response to the people and places encountered during the journey. The final two weeks immerses each student into making wearable shoe prototypes alongside Italian footwear technicians in a hosted Italian school of footwear. Upon return to RISD, students have the opportunity to curate and exhibit their shoes in a shared gallery space.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt;All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00  &lt;BR&gt; Wintersesion 2017 Travel Cost: $4,024.00 - airfare not included. &lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study***</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As of December 2014, 38 million people were displaced globally due to conflict, generalized violence or human rights violations. Migration and immigration are at the forefront of conversation throughout the world. How can we as designers contribute to the needs of displaced individuals? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Beginning with in depth research at homeless and refugee agencies we will start to determine the immediate needs of their clients. Through a variety of field trips we will gather information that will inform our designs. By interviewing and discussing the challenges displaced people face we will offer design solutions to address the relevant issues uncovered. We will initiate a dialogue that attempts to understand the needs of displaced people. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Prototypes will be formed for final critique. All disciplines encouraged to participate. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $30.00  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture Department;  Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will review the fundamentals of wood in architecture with a focus on wood materials and construction systems and lumber and timber structural analysis and design.  Work includes timber systems consisting of conventional framing trusses, laminates, built-up sections and connections. In addition, this course will review the principles of structural loads; gravity, lateral, live and dead.  The concept of lateral resistance through standard wood framing systems will be explored. Manufactured lumber has become a major part of today's wood construction industry and the design and detailing of these materials will be explored in depth. By the end of the course, students will be aware of the role of wood materials in architectural design and construction and be able to design and detail simple Lumber and Timber structural systems.  They will be able to proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis.   This course will provide the student with a good understanding of the material and the common structural and architectural systems used in today's practice.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Requirement: ARCH majors only.&lt;br&gt; Registration by the Architecture Department.&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Serious research and a specific preparation begins in this course, forming the theoretical basis for the creative development of the Degree Project (Spring, 6 credits). This is a period in which the nature of the work is clarified, a process is developed, possibilities are examined, and research and information gathering completed.  The research from this course acts as an armature, establishing the attitude, objectives, and significance of the thesis as an exploration of architectural ideas, and forming the underpinnings for the work of the coming semester.  The result of this effort, begun in the fall with DP prep and completed in the spring, is gathered together and reflected in the DP Book as part of the requirements for completion of Degree Project. The work is reviewed at the end of Wintersession; satisfactory completion of this course is a prerequisite for the Degree Project in the Spring semester.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department; course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Schedule to be determined with Advisor&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPIC IN ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on drawing topics pertaining to architecture. Drawing is treated as a space for architectural research and/or as an autonomous work of architecture. The notion that drawing serves architecture merely as representation is questioned and critiqued. The theoretical and technical focus on the process of drawing will cultivate and address issues that have for hundreds of years served as the core of the architecture discipline. Simultaneously, the research may allow for the generation or assimilation of ideas, cultures and knowledge from other fields into architecture. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Using the creative cultures of Germany, Netherlands and Belgium, students will use the experience of footwear design as a way to more deeply understand and expand their own personal design process. This course will inform through the practice of creative introspections inspired by Da Vinci's methods as well as from Northern European history design practice and cultural aesthetic. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;  There will be a series studio and factory visits within a variety of design fields supported by museum and gallery visits. Students will also use their sketchbooks as visual and reflective journals to practice insightful daily exercises to advance their design process and footwear designs. During the visit to Northern Europe we will have three presentations to share cultural explorations, process development and the progress of shoe designs. The final shoe design will represent the influence of these explorations and the manifestation of an expanded design methodology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies. &lt;br&gt; Wintersession 2017 Travel cost: $2,650.00 - airfare not included.&lt;br&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POROSITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this wintersession architectural design studio, we will explore the idea of architectural porosity by experiencing the fragmented reality's latent potential. Our architectural invention will aim at trans-position of the existing urban dead-end spaces to a reciprocal material mode by locating their constructive elements' affinities via porosity. We will understand these existing urban dead-end conditions as the analogue or miniature of the city to its larger scale and deeper complexity, which shares the exact same spirit of unidirectional urban development within the capitalism or the state power's desire. We will study both the larger urban system and the analogue you are working with. Porosity will help us to understand or research the potential collaborative relationship of each dead end's material properties and mental conditions, or projecting their reciprocal network, while at the same time porosity will also be the formal organization for spatializing and materializing the re-created construction to an autonomous architectural invention. We may say that in this studio the effect will be to reduce the distance between the analogue and the bigger city.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ASH MOUNTAINS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research seminar focuses on volcanoes as a medium to examine crossroads between architecture, landscape and geology. An increase in defensive urbanism from sea walls to riverine containment boundaries has accompanied the advance of climate adaption strategies in recent years. While visions of protective design promote the idea of keeping things out, volcanic phenomena, recalibrates our understanding that we in fact live above, amidst, and below moving matter in intermittent shift. Aimed at provoking new ways of associating design within and not against environmental change, the course will experiment with alternative relations between deep time and everyday life.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Students are invited to survey and inquire a volcanic scale of interest. Scales can range across time and space, from the volcanic slopes of Pinatubo, Philippines to Mauna Loa, Hawaii, all the way to the volcanic materiality of the Pantheon in Rome or Luis Barragan's urban development atop the lava fields of Mexico City. Through a series of workshops, discussions and tasks, students will combine and produce mixed media narratives to propose projective scenarios for inhabiting active grounds.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The research methodology will be divided into two parts: Substrate and Imagination. The first part consists of detailing what a substrate is and can be, as an expansion of site in a specific geographical, geomorphological, and cultural context. As the Substrate has been defined, student's will proceeded to propose alternative futures. Rigorous speculation and a critical stake on colonial modes of representation will inform the process behind these projective environments.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Computer skills such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are mandatory. Basic instruction in GIS will be provided. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100-$250</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Providence has 113 public parks, and many of them play a significant role in the life of the neighborhood. Over 50 of these parks have friends of the park organizations who coordinate programming. The Partners for Providence Parks brings together public, non-profit and private organizations to better coordinate the efforts for these great Public Spaces.  This course will study three of these parks in order to generate possible design build projects in partnership with the Parks Foundation.  The foundation has identified a couple areas of exploration; one will be to design and build  "Micro Free Libraries" (at the scale of a shrine) and the other will be to design food literacy structures (at the scale of a communal kitchen)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This course will explore both the scale of structures and the elements from which they could be composed. The concepts for the structure will be conceived through the design studio were the pedagogy is focused on the needs and possibilities of a particular community program and the technical demands of structure and material.  We will be developing schematic ideas for buildable structures with guidance of design professionals, members of the host community and the student themselves.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will explore the illustrative development of surface and and its relation to space. Wood construction, which is one of the oldest building materials, will be the focus. In the field of architecture, there is a renewed understanding of the sustainable properties of wood along with new means of prefabrication and joinery. Through international collaboration and sponsored research, the department of architecture has developed an expertise in new uses in wood.  We will focus the design build by exploring wood construction and prototyping in our studios and workshops.  In this Wintersession course we will develop a prefabricated wood system (a kit of parts) that can be multiplied, adapted, assembled and deployed in the specific conditions of the city parks and other community public spaces.  The component system will be designed to be deployed in different settings where prefabricated parts can be assembled in new and different ways. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This course would be open as a cross disciplinary course.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WRITING AS ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is writing about architecture? Do we write through / around / or with architecture? Can we make architecture through writing? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course is about writing as an architecture, writing as an architectural practice, and architecture as writing. What is the relationship between the act of writing and the making of architecture? We seek the creation of architecture without (necessarily) the physical tools we normally employ, such as model making and drawing. Writing as architecture is a project that can go beyond the traditional forms in which architecture is conceived, creating new and unexpected architectures made of both words and / or materials.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This is a seminar-based course, relying on the close reading of varied texts such as Nikolai Gogol's depictions of the grotesque urbanism of twentieth-century Russia, Lina Bo Bardi's historical manifestos for a new Brazilian architecture, Bernard Tschumi's concise and provocative 'advertisements' on architecture, and more. Throughout the course we will also have guest lectures on divergent architectural-writing practices, including topics like coding, translation, and the practice of writing in predominantly visual practices. The texts and lectures will support class discussions on the questions raised above, and will prompt the written work that students are asked to produce throughout the winter semester.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  We will be working collaboratively towards the execution of a printed class publication, with the help of the RISD Writing Center, and with the potential extension of course projects to the 2017 Work In Progress.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING GAMES WE PLAY/ PLAYING GAMES WE DRAW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals. (1) To give students an in depth survey of 3d modeling and hybrid digital drawing methods, with a focus on discovery. (2) To partake in group and individual exploration of a brief design problem based on the games we play. The course will focus a simple problem of representation. How can we represent the spaces in which we conduct play? Since we were toddlers, we have been engaging in play through various architectural spaces; playground, fields, pitches, game boards, video games, etc. This course will seek to better understand these play spaces through digital representation, and define the movements and rules that take place within these architectures. As new methods are introduced, we will be able to further refine our understanding of the places we are seeking to describe. Explorations will culminate in a curated set of rules and drawings that describe a new type of play-architecture, as well as a group gallery exhibition.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENSITIVE RESPONSES: EXPLORING DRAWINGS THROUGH OUR SENSES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How can you use your emotions and senses to create space? What design strategies would make you feel comfort and warmth, or on the contrary, fear and isolation?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   We spend our time trying to fit ourselves within the environments we coexist with, rather than allowing the space to coexist with us. Through lectures, class critiques, drawing and 3-dimensional modeling exercises, we will begin to understand the dichotomy between our emotions and senses in relation to the space we inhabit. Part one involves the investigation and analysis of your own emotions through stimulus activities, which will then be documented in three mixed-media drawings. The class will then shift gears to a three-dimensional object, using the previous analysis as a datum to create a probe that a person can occupy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;   The goal is to complete this class with a set of three drawings and a full scale 3-dimentional volume. Students will gain a better understanding of their emotional responses and of common spatial configurations. The modeling exercises will help materialize something as intangible as our emotions, within an architectural context. We will have three local site visits, emphasizing the architectural elements that impact the way we feel within a given space. There are many strategies architects use in order to alter the way we perceive depth, process scale, and isolate our senses. The assignments for this class will be a balancing act between fine arts, architectural design and human psychology -  similar to many practicing firms and existing spaces. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class will serve as an interface between the new technologies of digital media, and the old technologies of optics. New digital technologies will be given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses. Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class will encourage collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and will foster the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Elective: Open to senior, fifth-year, graduate.&lt;br&gt; Also offered as GLASS 7009.

Students will also propose a longer term investigation, that will develop in the form of a semester long project.  &lt;br&gt; We will explore both analog and digital technologies to develop the concepts presented during the semester, utilizing Final Cut, After Effects, Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Ableton Live and/or other programs for the production of texts. The course will have an interactive sound and image emphasis. Students will experiment with interactive text, visuals, and audio composition in the digital realm, placing emphasis on the effect and meaning transformation that occurs when texts are combined with visuals and audio material.  &lt;br&gt; The course will balance conceptual concerns related to content and structuring methodologies with artistic expression. Specific Aesthetic histories will be explored tracing the use of text in artistic practice including Concrete Poetry, the texts of Kurt Schwitters, Russian Constructivist posters, Fluxus poetic works, the Dada and Surrealist Word/Image, Magritte, Jenny Holtzer, Ed Ruscha, Barbara Kruger as well as other contemporary practitioners.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective, Open to senior, graduate.

It is a combined studio and seminar forum for Digital + Media first-year students. Participants become familiar with a vocabulary of multiple practices within digital media and, through a rigorous, hands-on approach, develop a thorough understanding of computational media as it applies to her/his individual creative practice. Students are introduced to a core set of methodologies and technologies from basic electronics and programming to interaction design to installation, and are encouraged to break comfort zones and practice through experimentation. Students conceptualize and discuss their studio-based work and their ongoing practice. Readings in critical cultural theory, media art theory, philosophy, semiotics and other areas further ground the conceptual approach of students in the Digital + Media department. The course is a mix of individual meetings, a required lecture and workshop series and group critiques. Some guest lecturers and visiting critics may also become involved with this class in terms of critical/research aspects. With a focus on studio experimentation and production, students will conceptualize and discuss their works-in-progress while beginning to work with new materials and systems in combination with a broad range media.

   <COURSEDESC>In this historical survey, we analyze the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. We examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged. We make connections across decades by focusing on the recurring themes of language, futurism, simulation, hyper-reality, transnationality and information.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MEDIA WRITTEN THESIS PREP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In  "On Permission to Write", essayist Cynthia Ozick distinguishes between the "good-citizen writer" and the "shaman-writer"  The first, she says, writes dutifully; the second, "obsessively", "torrentially", and most crucially, with self-given permission. For artists and designers who have, by and large, favored visual over written expression, obsession and torrent probably come more naturally in the studio than on the page. This course seeks to bring that same uninhibited, exploratory, and illuminating sensibility to the thesis, to suggest that writing is not a duty, but rather can be integral to studio practice. We will look at writing about one's work -- its art-historical, theoretical, and personal sources; its form and process; its motivation; its interpretation -- as a kind of translation from form to language (one that can be as individual and authentic as our chosen materials). The course will include writing exercises designed to help us think more deeply and coherently about our work and ideas, as well as discussion of assigned readings. The readings are exclusively written by artists and designers: criticism, manifestos, journal writings, and artist interviews - a selection intended to suggest that in permitting themselves to write, artists and designers establish artistic agency, lineage, and history itself through that writing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graduate major requirement, Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to second-year graduates&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHYSICAL COMPUTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Physical Computing is an introduction to low-level electronic technologies such as sensors, microcontrollers, display technologies and motors. We will review the basics of electricity and microcontrollers (one-chip computers). A wide range of sensors, and output technologies will be presented, and demonstrated so that students have a sense of currently available low-cost technologies that are available for artwork and their course work.  &lt;br&gt; The hardware on which the course will be based is low-cost wireless microcontroller modules and a basic array of sensors and interface tech. The modules can be used to record data from the body wirelessly, or to harvest user information from a gallery installation. The modules can also be used to drive output systems, such as displays, sound, or motors. Students will also be expected to pursue technology that interests them including specialized sensors and output devices.  &lt;br&gt; If there is class interest and time we can construct our own printed circuit boards, to show students how to "close the loop" between the roles of consumers and constructors of hardware based electronic systems.  &lt;br&gt;  Readings and discussions will interrogate some of the latest tech industry jargon such as the "Internet of Things" and the place that robots and automation might have in the future, as well as writings by artists working with technology. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; graduate level&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, fifth-year, space permitting. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course supports the exploration of theoretical, social, material, technical and contextual research and concerns in new media arts practice during the first year of the first year of the D + M MFA program. It is a combined studio and seminar forum for Digital + Media first-year students. Participants become familiar with a vocabulary of multiple practices within digital media and, through a rigorous, hands-on approach, develop a thorough understanding of computational media as it applies to her/his individual creative practice. Students are introduced to a core set of methodologies and technologies from basic electronics and programming to interaction design to installation, and are encouraged to break comfort zones and practice through experimentation. Students conceptualize and discuss their studio-based work and their ongoing practice. Readings in critical cultural theory, media art theory, philosophy, semiotics and other areas further ground the conceptual approach of students in the Digital + Media department. The course is a mix of individual meetings, a required lecture and workshop series and group critiques. Some guest lecturers and visiting critics may also become involved with this class in terms of critical/research aspects. With a focus on studio experimentation and production, students will conceptualize and discuss their works-in-progress while beginning to work with new materials and systems in combination with a broad range media. Each student will practice articulating their ongoing studio art process and work, and will contribute to the dialogue concerning the research and work of their classmates.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> Participants in the Technological Landscapes research group are passionate but critical observers of today's living environment in relation to ubiquitous, integrated, and emerging technologies. It is important that we draw inspiration not necessarily just from art, design, but from real-world events influenced or caused by technological advancement and/or failure.    This research group will foster a dynamic, and highly collaborative environment through discussions, readings and excursions. Participants are expected to drive and determine the focus and interests of the group through conversations and consensus. In turn this will feed each participant's artistic sensibility and will form the conceptual foundations necessary for building a strong critical art work. Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The projects, individual or collaborative, should be thought of on a scale of landscape physical or virtual. One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Please contact the instructor with any questions and for more details.&lt;br&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL + MEDIA THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As critical phenomenology, the aim of this course is to influence two acts, how to see and how to critique digital media, as extension of unresolved conceptual and aesthetic problems and as catapult for entirely original practice and possibility. The approach is the 'theoretical crit' that students write each week in response to readings, methods, problems, and works closely explored. As in contemporary art, new media's objects and theories are becoming increasingly interdependent. Thus, rather than using theory to evaluate artwork, we examine both work and theory, coming to contemporary, formal, critical, and instrumental voice through which to respond to assumptions and aspirations of each.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: INTERVENTIONS IN CAPITALISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Propaganda is a powerful tool for politicians, corporations, advertisers, cultural institutions, and anyone else who is looking to manipulate a story. But it is also a starting point for acts of subversion, humor, and many forms of creative resistance. This research group will assist artists in attempting to find political and imaginative expression in pieces of culture that are often regarded as anti-creative. &lt;BR&gt;  From data mining to resource extraction, everything seems to become a series data points in vast demographic and economic rating systems. We are bombarded with an environment having little or no value for individual creative exchange. The missing variable in all of these equations is the freedom and importance of the single thinking human who is disregarded in these culture-as-market movements. The goal of this studio is to find intuitive ways to re-purpose this environment through guerilla communication, activist art, and the creative re-use of spin control techniques.&lt;BR&gt;  Potential areas of investigation may include: wearable computing, physical computing, interactive performance, tactical media, art science collaboration, material science, smart materials, artificial life and serious game design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Permission of instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to graduate students and senior and fifth-year undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Fee: $200.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DATA OBJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a class about how code allows humans to understand complexity.  As an extension of our ideas, code allows us to interact with data beyond the scope of normal perception.  Yet coding alone cannot account for our innate drive to perceive nuance and meaning in complexity.  It is in respect to both these approaches that we address the relevant languages, processes, and theory.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Sources of data will include: biometry, social media, computer vision, text, audio, the audience, and hardcoded data.  Students will gain the skills to make interactive tools, displays, environments and systems. The course will consist of examinations of creative precedent in contemporary art and design and conceptual context from neuroscience, epistemology and philosophy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;    Students will use their own laptops and are encouraged to bring in alternative hardware/sensors.  The principle languages used will be Processing and Arduino.  No prior knowledge required but previous exposure to coding will allow students to go further with the presented material.  &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $200.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to all students&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course embraces the concept of digital light projection as a broad field of practice. Beginning with the camera obscura, this experimental and multidisciplinary course will involve a range of interdisciplinary individual and collaborative exercises, experiments, workshops, lectures, readings, discussions and projects that explore digital light projection-site-specific, LED related practices, immersive video and light projection installations, interactive, and choreographic theater related projection work-that continue to this day and shape the parameters of visual perception and communication. Deconstructing the concept of the screen, students are encouraged to bring in their expertise and explore the concept of the screen through investigating projection in sculptural/architectural installation contexts in public and private spaces. Video projection mapping, Arduino, and After Effects are used to shape visual elements for light projection. The potential for inventing new methods of manipulating light will be encouraged.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $200.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to all students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this class, students will create their own games from scratch, while learning how to analyze games from the perspective of storytelling, game mechanics, user interface and informative user experience. Although we will discuss everything from board games to virtual reality, this course will mainly focus on the design and impact of video games and games informed by digital technologies. Students will use the flexibility of Processing to explore both traditional (keyboard and mouse) and non-traditional (audio, tracking) controls.&lt;BR&gt;  No programming experience is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to all students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PANTS ON FIRE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Pants On Fire will scrutinize everything from pseudoscience and pseudonyms to catfishing and cover-ups. We'll discuss where to delineate divisions between faker, forger, fraud, and felon; how to collect -- and create -- and implement convincing evidence; and how deception can serve as a tool for revealing the truth. Students will critically engage with and examine the process of crafting narratives through strategic and selective displays of information. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will work throughout the course to develop their own narrative, persona, or myth as well as a rich network of supporting artifacts. Assignments will emphasize real-world experimentation, interventions, and performance. These weekly assignments, complemented by corresponding lectures, screenings, readings, and discussions, will continue to develop and advance the ongoing narrative. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;   After an initial inquiry into codes of behavior and narrative construction, we'll turn our focus to examining and crafting personas. We'll talk about cons, science fiction, pseudoscience, magic, the neuroscience of deception, selective attention, the issues and ethics of identity, conspiracy theories, and unexplained phenomena. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  We'll focus on using narrative to create and embody loaded context and concepts to bolster the appearance of authority. Successfully skewing reality requires a deep understanding of the systems in play, so research methodology will be emphasized. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This is not necessarily a performance art class. The focus is on the surrounding/peripheral artifacts that support a story/situation/dialog; delivery is secondary. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Transparency offers both the ability to look at and look through media.  Reflection, refraction, projection, and absorption are just the starting points for a dialogue involving the material and representational implications of painting and glass.  Through hands on interface between these two disciplines we will strive to create alternative possibilities for aiding and altering vision. The class structure will promote collaboration between students with differing skills and technical backgrounds. The class will solicit active exchange and crossover all semester long.  Independent research and collaborative studio work will be asked of everyone.   Readings and lectures will cover theories and artists surrounding the topics of vision, imaging, projection, representation, and transparency.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE: THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $25.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Instructor permission required. Also offered as LAEL-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm. MML &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Directing class, students are encouraged to go beyond the first instinct or idea, and to develop a project to its fullest potential, particularly with respect to meaning and to potential modes of execution. Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective.

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR STUDIO:OPEN MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This path, within the senior studio options, allows for the exploration of a broad range of hybrid practices.  Through the structural support of this year-long studio, students will produce a project that synthesizes their understanding of and aspirations for media art practice.  Works produced use media as their point of departure, but may take a variety of forms including performance, installation, public art, intervention, networked/collaborative production, print publication, activism, etc.  The course prepares students to work with depth in their use of media and as contemporary artists in a complex art world, in which media is often only one component in a larger project.&lt;BR&gt; Students receive weekly individual guidance from the instructor and peers, as well as two critiques by prominent working artists or related practitioners.  During the spring semester, each student explores the notion of distribution intensively, resulting in the crafting of individualized forms of presentation.  Each student also develops a portfolio of their work, focused on communicating their core interests to a defined group.  Class meetings are devoted to presentations of related artists works, individual meetings and group critique.  Fall semester includes field trips to events in the NY/New England area.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: Varies considerably with production design.

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed as an introduction to the 113-year history of the projected moving image (film, animation, and video). Artistic expression in these forms will be emphasized. Students discover new areas of interest while watching carefully selected examples of films and videos. During all classes, students will view films representing different styles and periods of filmmaking. About half of the classes are devoted to contemporary films. Critical thinking will be encouraged and fostered during classroom discussions. Clear expression of these thoughts will be developed through assigned readings and weekly writing assignments. During the semester, students learn about specific artists, schools of filmmaking, genres, and fields within the history of the film, animation, and video. Students also develop a common language by learning the meaning and proper usage of a glossary of common film terms. At select classes, film artists are present to introduce and discuss their work. Other guests include improvisational musicians who accompany silent films.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Registration priority to FAV majors&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER ANIMATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;  Major elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY CINEMA PRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Intro Film explores techniques of live action 16MM film production using Bolex cameras and flatbed editing tables. Technical concerns such as exposure, focus, depth of field, and basic editing conventions are covered. Aesthetic concerns such as composition, movement, editing rhythms, and the filmmaker's intention are discussed and critiqued. Students complete three individual assignments outside of class, and four in-class exercises in pairs or groups. The individual assignments encourage creative use of editing techniques such as traditional match-cutting, graphic match-cutting, and cross-cutting or parallel editing. The first individual project is silent, but for those that follow, students create soundtracks using elements such as effects, music, ambient sound, and voiceover.  Screenings in class include student rushes, works in progress, and finished films. In addition, a variety of short films are screened and discussed that relate to many of the techniques and aesthetic considerations explored throughout the semester.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $220.00  Deposit: $150.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by FAV department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required for nonmajors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A Collaborative Study Project (CSP) allows two students to work collaboratively to complete a faculty supervised project of independent study. &lt;br&gt; Usually, a CSP is supervised by two faculty members, but with approval it may be supervised by one faculty member. Its purpose is to meet individual student needs by providing an alternative to regularly offered courses, though it is not a substitute for a course if that course is regularly offered.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMATION INTEGRATION/INSTALLATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio investigates the use of animation as an art form integrated into a cross-disciplinary practice using installation, performance and interactivity. This is different from traditional animation filmmaking in that students are instead exploring variations of the constructed cinematic object and the engagement of the human body as an active participant in the cinematic schema. The student uses the tenets of animation to consider the (de/re)construction of sequential image, identities of transmission and reception, the context of the projected image and light, the monitor as receptacle, motorized optical machines, environment and location. The course includes lectures, demonstrations, project workshops and studio practice. Emphasis is placed upon the conceptual, material, practical and creative approaches to reconsidering and re-making what animation is and can be. The course culminates with final projects. Prior animation experience is not necessary.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in visualizing, and also to bolster students' confidence in their ability to write small programs to accomplish useful goals. The class will use Python; a general-purpose object-oriented interpreted language one can use for countless standalone projects or scripting applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.&lt;BR&gt; Also offered as IDISC-1539. Register into the course for which credit is desired.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Junior, Senior&lt;br&gt; Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world.

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assign¬ments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assign¬ments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action.

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assign¬ments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assign¬ments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMBIENT INTERFACES: ACTIVATED OBJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a practical and conceptual exploration into electronic sensors, processors and actuators in the context of interactive art and design. Students will turn everyday objects into "ambient interfaces" or "responsive systems" that respond to conditions of the human body, data networks, and the environment. Contemporary works of art and design - from kinetic sculpture and sound art to installation, architecture and product design - will be examined through readings and presentations. Open-source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with fundamentals of electronic circuitry. Emphasis is given to the development of creative projects (individual or collaborative), followed by an iterative implementation process (planning, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining). The course is structured around a series of tutorials and exercises, culminating in a final project. Students also present work-in-progress and prototypes during class reviews to receive qualitative feedback from the class and the instructor. Participants will engage with physical computing conceptually and technically in their studio work and are encouraged to leverage their individual backgrounds to excel in the respective context. It is encourage that students bring their own laptop. No prior programming or electronics experience is required to take the course. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FIGURE MODELING MARATHON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This intensive studio is based on the premise that study is an abstractive process. We will begin at a very basic level to define features of this process with exercises in form and small studies of posed models.  We'll use oil-based "Clean Clay", first unsupported, then over armatures, and gradually work up to 7/8 scale for portraits and 1/2 scale for figures.  While the yield will be three well-resolved portraits and two figures, both studied and invented, our underlying goal is the development of form consciousness, a notion of what organic form is, the idea of its integrity.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; To handle the spatial reckoning rigors of this class, students must possess solid drawing skills. They must have earned a grade of B or better in Foundation Drawing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The 6-credit class meets four days a week, Monday-Thursday, 1-6pm, for six weeks.  Students must be prepared to dedicate Friday and one day each weekend for additional, scheduled model sessions.  They must be able to carry on development and completion of assignments during hours outside class time.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As there will be insufficient time for mold-making or casting, students may choose to take away all finished works and/or provide a blank CD for transfer of photo documentation made by the instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated cost of materials: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ITALY:(IN)VISIBLE VENICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course presents the opportunity for a cultural and literary interrogation of Venice, in situ in combination with an immersive studio course. This 3-credit  Non-Major Studio (NMSE) is integrated with a mandatory/concurrent 3-credit Liberal Arts (LAS) component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A city of paradoxes or merely contradictions? American historian Thomas F. Madden describes Venice as "a city without land, an empire without borders."  French philosopher Régis Debray, on the other hand, calls it "a kind of Euro-Disney for snobs," whereas Italian novelist Italo Calvino treats it as a paradigmatic point of intersection between death and desire, and so the quintessence of every city on earth.  Venice's status as off-shore metropolis at the top of the Adriatic - a marshy haven from invading "barbarians" that has conquered, traded with and been dominated by its antagonists, including the sea over more than a millennium - makes it one of the most intriguing and atypical cities in Europe, if not the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take LAS-E723. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Material cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt; Wintersession 2017 Travel cost: $3,975.00 - airfare included&lt;br&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ARGENTINA: SUDAMERICA HI/LOW TECH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>SUDAMERICA HI/LOW TECH is a travel course designed as an immersive experience into material culture through the making with electronics and physical computing. Latin America has a long-standing and unrivaled history of hybridity that began over 500 years ago and persists until today. Contemporary Argentina is not an exception, and exists within globalizing processes of cross-cultural contacts that create world markets for money and material goods, migrants, and information. This course will provide a comprehensive exposure for recognizing the nature and value of "a world of sciences and arts" multiple scientific, technological, and artistic traditions adapted to local materials, regional needs, resources, and interests.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Centralized in Buenos Aires city, with our headquarter studio at the local makerspace, Espacio Nixso, this course is a hands-on workshop which will introduce the fundamentals of DIY electronic circuits, embedded programming, sensor signal processing, simple mechanisms, and time-based behavior; along with an in-depth investigation into the forms uses, interpretations, and meanings of objects, products, images, and environments in everyday Argentina. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Besides our partnership with the local community at Espacio Nixso, during this course we will be working closely with two very different Material Libraries. The first one dedicated to the collection of industrial solid wastes located in Avellaneda, one of the foremost wholesale and, industrial centers of Argentina, situated within, the grater Buenos Aires metropolitan area. The, other material library is located in Oberá, Province of Misiones, in the northeastern corner, of the country, about 700 miles from Buenos, Aires. This library collects regional materials, (organic and locally manufactured) such as wood, minerals, metals, textiles, and clay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Students will attend field trips to museums, local informal markets, milongas, popular and folklore music shows, visits to different worker, cooperatives, among others daily field trips. The studio will also have a strong component into reading discussions and lectures, as well as weekly studio visits and talks from renown local artists, designer, and scholars. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Students will keep an active travel journal and sketchbook in response to site visits, assigned readings, and short assignments. These materials combined with an immersion in the Argentinian lifestyle will inform the final project - an interactive object examining the relationship between hi and low technologies, knowledges, and materials. The final projects will be exhibit at final review with guest critics and open to the general public.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.

   <COURSETITLE>L'ARTISTA IN CITTA: THE ARTIST IN THE CITY: PROVIDENCE AND ROME</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will begin in Providence during the first six weeks of spring semester, include a study-travel component to Rome during March break and conclude during the last six weeks of the semester in Providence. In this travel/study course, students will explore a variety of ways to observe, document and respond to their surroundings in Providence.  From the beginning of spring semester 2017 until March break, students will meet Thursdays from 8 am -1 pm. During this time before the study-travel component, students will be expected to 1) investigate their environment in Providence, 2) gain valuable experiences drawing on-site and in public, 3) develop drawing approaches to discover how visual aspects like space and mark convey meaning, and 4) become more cognizant of the layers of their environment (spatial, personal, collective, cultural, historical, ecological). Drawing in Providence in February/March will introduce students to the pressures and pleasures of drawing from life to equip them to draw while traveling and to develop the skills, insights and fluency needed to be responsive and observant. Before and during their time in Italy, students will experiment with a variety of visual approaches and processes, and begin to notice the peculiarities of their own relationships to the space and history of the cities. Class time, homework assignments and critiques will be devoted to helping students maximize the complexity, subtlety and distinctiveness of their description of space as a way to understand and express their relationship to that space. Although initial emphasis will be placed on perceptual drawing, the goal of this deep immersion into observational, on-site drawing is to discover relationships to and between the two cities.  Professor Zlotsky's students will travel with Professor Suzanne Scanlan and students enrolled in her Spring 2017 art history course, The Grand Tour. Students in the two courses will share some activities (museums, day trips to Pompeii, Herculaneum and Ostia [this list of day trips is tentative]) as well as stay in the same accommodations in Rome.  When both sets of professors and students travel to the same location, the drawing students will receive an introduction from Professor Scanlan before embarking on their own responsive drawing research and investigation.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   After returning from Italy, students will complete an individually directed drawing project that chronicles an important aspect of their relationship to Providence.  These projects will be shaped by a personal and intellectual discovery process leading to a work or works centered around issues of visibility, connection, history and movement. After returning from Rome,  the class will meet every other Thursdays during class time to critique works-in-process.  Work completed will be exhibited in the Waterman Building exhibition space during the last week of the semester.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   &lt;I&gt;Thursdaays 8 am -1 pm until March break.  Additional meeting TBA the week before break. During March break, full time participation in Rome from the Friday before March break to the last Sunday of March break. After returning to Providence, the class will meet every other Thursday. &lt;br&gt; Additionally, students will be expected to learn a small vocabulary of Italian phrases to help them negotiate  museums, restaurants, streets and shops. The lab fee will cover air fare, transportation to/from airport, transportation within Italy, museum admission and hotel accommodations. Students are required to purchase art materials and meals. &lt;br&gt; Estimated travel cost:  To be determined&lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Witness trees, as designated by the National Park Service, are long-standing trees that have "witnessed" key events, trends, and people in history. In this joint studio/liberal arts course, students have the unique opportunity to study and work with a fallen witness tree, shipped to RISD from a national historic site. The course will involve three components: 1) a field trip to the tree's site at the beginning of the semester; 2) classroom-based exploration of American history, memory, landscape, and material culture; and 3) studio-based building of a series of objects from the tree's wood, in response to both the site and students' classroom study. Overall, the course will explore both how material artifacts shape historical understanding and how historical knowledge can create meaningful design. Wood this year has been designated from the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site in Kinderhook, New York. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Students will receive 3 credits in Furniture elective and 3 credits in HPSS, for a total of 6 credits&lt;br&gt; A single fee of $100.00 will be charged for your concurrent registration in HPSS S732/FURN 2451 courses.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Long known as the "Beehive" of industry, Providence RI is one of the most diverse manufacturing hubs in the US.  Although today's global market continues to absorb these resources, Providence has retained a highly skilled manufacturing center that is eager to work with the creative arts. This rare resource provides designers the unique ability to work locally with manufacturing re-sources from traditional lost wax casting to emerging manufacturing technologies such as laser cutting, multi-axis cnc, and rapid prototyping. Throughout the course we will visit manufacturing, marketing, and retail facilities to develop a working understanding of production processes and methods available to you and how best to effectively implement these resources into your work as a designer/artist.  The studio course will conclude with each student presenting a finished production ready object in multiples along with supporting marketing materials. By approaching this class from a design, manufacturing, and marketing perspective students will acquire a practical knowledge of production strategies essential to the success of a designer today. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIGHTING DESIGN 101</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $50.00 - $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;Elective for Majors and Non-Majors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques for example crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way through out the entire process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   There is a possibility that some of the work created in this course will be part of a public exhibition. In order to consider work from this course for a public exhibition, a high level of execution and professionalism is expected. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fee: $125.00&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class  serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses.  Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise.&lt;br&gt; Course also offered as D+M 7009.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF GLASS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for junior BFA.GLASS students&lt;br&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of department head or instructor required &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' and designers' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>&lt;B&gt; Public Art: History, Theory, and Practice&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; This course offers the opportunity to discover the creative and career possibilities in the growing interdisciplinary field of public art and public practice. During the first half of the course, students research and present aspects of each weekly topic, including: pivotal events and artworks that formed the history of public art from the early 20th century to the present; individual artist's work and approaches to site-specificity; current debates around defining the public, public space, and community; temporary vs. permanent work; controversies in public art; memorials, monuments, and anti-monuments; a case study of design team practice in a public/private development; public art administration models, among other topics. During the second half, students work both individually and collaboratively on proposals and projects: a proposal for a memorial; proposals for a specific site in Providence; and temporary artworks sited in Providence.&lt;br&gt;  This is a collaborative course with Brown University's Program in Public Humanities. In the fall the course is on the Brown campus and on Brown's academic schedule. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Note: Note: This is a collaborative course with Brown University's Program in Public Humanities. For 2016 Fall the course is on the Brown campus and on Brown's academic schedule. The location is 357 Benefit Street, second floor seminar room.  There are 6 openings for RISD graduate students within the 15 total openings.&lt;br&gt; Contact Info: janetzweig@me.com&lt;br&gt; Graduate elective - studio.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of "humanitarian help" across the world. Whether they are designing refugee camps, village schools, water filtration systems, or textiles, they are seen to be critical in confronting challenges of poverty. Yet as form-givers, designers and artists not only make physical objects, but also shape our understanding of the problem at hand as well as the profile of the person in need. This power to represent, to define both the subject and the context, demands that designer and artist should not only be technically proficient and aesthetically capable, but also be able to think about the ethics of intervention.&lt;br&gt;   Whose convenience do we design for? What critical aspects of the situation, be they historical, cultural, linguistic, geopolitical, do we censor with our designs? Do we make others' problems appear in need of our solutions? If we take these questions as a starting point, what sort of knowledge, what sort of sensibility is needed to lean to talk, to see, to translate, across difference, without turning whom we seek to help into convenient caricatures? Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions, leaving larger political and policy discussions for other disciplines? Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself.&lt;br&gt;   This course asks these hard questions and unpacks them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study. This is not a "how-to" course. Nor will we use ready-made definitions of ethics to endorse convenient and familiar ways of working. This is a course about thinking. We slowly shape an understanding of ethics as a way of introducing reflective friction in our modes of operation and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use. Course material includes mind-opening historical and theoretical texts, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO LANGUAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This combination studio/seminar course explores the relationship between art and language on multiple scales. We collectively examine - through in-class discussions, lectures, readings, and critique of studio assignments - how our relationships to language make possible an aesthetics of communication, a space where visual and verbal intersections speak of interactions between cultures. Lectures present the work of artists who use text, translation, voice, and language learning as strategies to parlay their socio-linguistic perceptions into agency. Critique of student work produced in response to assignments focuses on an exploration of language within and around each student's art practice. This course is recommended for those who speak more than one language or are interested in multiple Englishes and intercultural communication as material, subject, and foundation for creative excavation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate Elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS' WRITINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores the various ways modern and contemporary artists have written about their work from the 1950s to the present. By examining statements, journals, notebooks, interviews, diaries, essays, and critical texts by a variety of artists - spanning Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, and Jack Tworkov through to Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, and Eva Hesse - as well as more recent figures such as Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker, Fred Wilson, and the Critical Art Ensemble, the differing genres that artists have used to describe their work and that of others begins to emerge. Specific consideration is given to the ways in which these literary forms structure the content and meanings of artists' work. The course is constructed around in-class discussion of assigned texts, slide lectures, and visits to each student's studio. The seminar aims to extend the range of texts currently read by students, and additionally serves as a springboard for the development of the graduate thesis.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on the graduate level inquiry of wood-based construction designs and commensurate skills. Lighting and upholstery techniques as well as outside vendor protocols may be employed depending on the graduate student's design needs. Graduate students develop a multi-lateral skill set applicable to their area of study. Thesis concepts are often explored within this class. Students concentrate, in sequence, six weeks of studio-based learning of numerous techniques and skills followed by six weeks of a dedicated, full-scale, designed and executed piece. Located in the Center for Integrated Technologies (CIT), the Graduate Studies Wood Studio focuses on contemporary and traditional joinery, shaping, and bent lamination construction techniques. Surface treatments and finishing methods for metal and wood also will be covered throughout this class. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN AND THE DEVELOPING WORLD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students interested in exploring the role art and design can play in addressing social justice issues in vulnerable, under-resourced and often still-developing regions of the world. The course frames the international development debate and offers a critical look at changing attitudes in development theory over the past five decades. It explores some of the most innovative initiatives, especially those employing art and design in their strategies; and it examines what strategies communities themselves have used - those which often fall well below the radar screen of top-down international structures and programs. The seminar situates students' interests within the complexities and responsibilities that come with working in foreign cultures and discusses such engagement from ethical, sociological, political, communication, and consensus-building standpoints while underscoring the need for - and difficulties in achieving - critical social impact assessment.     &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ORIGIN POINT: GRADUATE THESIS IDEATION WORKSHOPS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The purpose of this seminar is to unearth a direction - an origin point - for your graduate thesis and to jump-start the writing process for the Master's written document. Organized as a series of writing intensive workshops, this forum will enable you to explore relevant ideas, themes, core values, and to conduct research in support of the inquiry process. The process involves seeking out and scrutinizing various angles of your perspective as an artist / designer. You will write from these angles to discover the emerging aspects of solutions that matter. Each class will suggest a specific theme or principle of inflection to precipitate what is needed for the work's progress. Included will be several forms of writing: profile, review, narrative essay, poem, report, extended caption, as well as several levels of research: archival, bibliographic, fieldwork, and interview. Emphasis will also be on maps of meaning that will be used as a way to further processes of ideation and understanding. At the conclusion of the seminar you will have a conceptual focus for your thesis that is clearly formulated visually and verbally. With this is place, the summer months can then be used productively to further the breadth and depth of this initial idea through open-ended exploration and self-generated work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;br&gt; Available to first-year graduate students only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GROUP CRITIQUE / CRITICAL DIALOGUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course serves as a forum for extended group critiques of the ongoing and self-initiated projects of its participants. While different disciplines have differing formats for critique, its practice in this class is not taken for granted. The course speculates on critique as a form - the crit, critique, and criticality as techniques. We trace our current conceptions of critique back to historic precedents in Critical Theory, the Situationist International, and Institutional Critique, and we examine how those strategies bear out today.&lt;br&gt;   In general, studio critiques are open-ended, generous, and rigorous analyses among peers. Critiques are a means of examining the conscious and unconscious intentions in your work and understanding how those intentions are read by a viewer. Through group critiques students develop critical skills that help them articulate the conceptual and formal premises of their work. The goals of this course are to foster a cogent and critical understanding of your practice, to aid you in the elaboration and illumination of your ideas and ongoing work, and to provide a site where a culture of critical inquiry and conversation across disciplines can take place.&lt;br&gt;   The seminar portion of the class includes examinations of practitioners tailored to fit the interests of participating students. In addition we examine readings by Friedrich Nietzsche, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Jacques Rancière, Peggy Phalen, Juli Carson, Andrea Fraser, Alexander Alberro, and others.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - studio&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The goal of this research is to help you develop and refine your ability to contextualize different aspects of your work and to articulate the interventions you intend to make by making it. Although writing is a regular and important component of the course, this is not a thesis-writing course. It is, rather, a course in which the thinking, writing, and making you do should contribute to the shape of the degree project/thesis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>v.1 is RISD's new graduate student-run publication (first issue to launch in May 2016). It is written, edited, designed, illustrated, and produced by RISD graduate students in all disciplines, in the context of this full-year course, with additional contributions from the graduate community at large. (The class meets biweekly in Fall and Spring, for a total of 3 credits. It is expected that students will enroll in both semesters.) The course is composed of two overlapping parts: 1.) a seminar investigating experimental contemporary art, design, cultural, and scholarly publications (in print, online, and live) that feature writing by artists and designers (think Design Observer, Dot Dot Dot, Triple Canopy, Cabinet, F.R. David, Mousse, Creative Time Reports, and Journal for Artistic Research, to name a few); and 2.) a studio in which the class becomes the v.1 staff-envisioning and making this annual view into what matters to our graduate community and the world beyond. The course combines guest lectures, seminar-style discussions of readings, workshop-style discussions of student writings, presentations of annotated bibliographies and submissions, hands-on editorial work, peer review, and ongoing feedback from the instructor. Artists and designers are contributing to cultural discourse like never before, and writing today takes many forms-scholarly, journalistic, critical, experimental, electronic, image- or design-driven, or hybrid. Together we develop not just a publication (whose form and content will change year to year, hence always being "volume 1"), but significant relationships between writing, art and design practice, and contributing to public discourse.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We explore the many materials we use as artists and consumers - how they are formed, extracted, developed, circulated, and used, and how we think about them. We look at the physical world through three lenses: science/production, theory, and art practice. These three approaches run concurrently throughout the semester so that students are simultaneously investigating, reading, and making work. The course has films, guest speakers, readings, participant presentations, course resources, and field trips.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How do you transform an existing text and/or piece of music into a world for performance? How do you design a space to tell a story? This studio explores the process of transformation and storytelling to create scenic designs for performance. Students create three projects during this course: a project for a proscenium theater, a thrust stage, and a flexible "black box" space. During this course students investigate the relationship between scenic design and existing theater architecture as well as the relationship between the audience and performance. Emphasis is given to the examination of the text or source material, the formulation of design ideas, and the visual expression of those ideas. Students acquire skills in research, drawing, and model-making for the theatrical design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - studio&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LATE MODERNISM/POST MODERNISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>With the rise of post-war movements such as the New York School, critical writing in the United States attained a certain urgency. How to define the radical meanings of mid-century art? This class considers the varied responses of Clement Greenberg, Harold Rosenberg, Meyer Schapiro, Leo Steinberg and others, and how their essays and reviews either refined pre-existing formalist strategies or turned to philosophical models such Marxism or existentialism. As their positions became increasingly entrenched in the late modernist period, a certain fallout ensued with the result that academically trained writers such Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, and Craig Owens eventually questioned once cornerstone beliefs in originality and the artist's subjectivity. Others, such as Michael Fried, Philip Leider, and William Rubin, remained devoted to formalist criteria. In a post-modern era where little or no critical consensus prevailed, a rich, diverse body of discourse emerged that is examined in depth through these and other key critics such as Arthur C. Danto, bell hooks, Cornell West, and Dave Hickey.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MULTI-DISCIPLINARY GRADUATE FINE ARTS SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines a breadth of critical and aesthetic issues relevant to a diverse group of innovative and genre-blending emerging artists about to enter into the continuum of contemporary Fine Arts praxis. Through readings, lectures, and class discussions, students in this weekly seminar explore the ideas and approaches manifest in the contemporary art world. Open to students from all disciplines with a Fine Arts practice, the class engages in discursive conversation, writing, and thinking about contemporary artistic practice in the expanded field - one that traverses disciplines and media. Student-generated writing, research, and studio practice contribute to the cultivation of a shared conceptual grammar that extends the limits of the experimental extremity of our practice. Related readings include canonical art historical texts and contemporary art criticism, fiction, and fact. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT NEXT?(MAKING A) LIVING AS AN ARTIST</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;B&gt;What Next? (Making a) Living as an Artist&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  For this Professional Practices course, we explore the practical possibilities for your life after art school. Emphasis is on balancing your artistic practice with the financial demands of everyday life, on integrating your career path(s) with your artistic values and integrity, on developing realistic goals and strategies, and on finding "branching paths" that open new prospects.&lt;BR&gt;   Various avenues are explored, such as: exhibiting in galleries and museums, starting a business, working on commission, art writing, social practice, and forming a collective, a publication, or an independent gallery. Current financial, practical, and ethical ramifications of each of these avenues are considered. We discuss what matters when deciding where, geographically, to begin your career. &lt;BR&gt;   The course provides a number of skills: creating proposals, presentations, artists' statements, and resumes; and obtaining grants, residencies, commissions, art-related employment, studio space, and representation. Also touched upon are art law, copyright, budgeting, and taxes for artists. &lt;BR&gt;   There are guest speakers from galleries, public art agencies, design businesses, and a trip to New York City. We meet RISD graduate alumni who are currently developing their careers as artists and designers, and hear about their paths from graduation to living as artists.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH FOR ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In art and design, inquiry, discovery, and awareness are essential to contextualizing one's practice, focusing one's creativity, and ethically and meaningfully situating one's work in the world. At the same time, "research" refers to a wide range of disciplinary theories, approaches, and projects. This course aims to foster new levels of research literacy through weekly presentation and discussion of actual research issues faced by working artists, designers, and scholars at RISD. Through shared investigation of research experiences and challenges, students learn more about various methods of inquiry (e.g., practice-based, archival, ethnographic, sociological, scientific, digital, etc.), engage with current issues of research practice, and work toward developing appropriate applications and potential lines of inquiry for their own degree work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIODESIGN STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores aspects of human knowledge of living systems providing a research-based approach to such topics as Biodesign, Biomimicry in Materials, and the cognitive phenomena of Biophyllia. The affinity we have as humans to natural living systems is in everything: from the spaces we inhabit to the metaphors we employ in order to understand complexity in general. Using the facilities and resources of the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab, graduate students create opportunities to experiment, observe, and learn about the networked aspects of living materials and processes. &lt;BR&gt;   One course objective is to establish bridges between art and design practices and scientific avenues of knowledge that seek to understand and represent properties of living systems. In the process of making these connections, a critical approach is taken to what we think of as knowledge and its communication.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - studio&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' and designers' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course also functions as a gateway to Co-Works, RISD's cross-departmental fab lab and experimental workspace; successful completion of the workshop grants access beyond the time frame of the course.  &lt;br&gt; Co-Works features digital tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, 4-axis CNC mill, plotter cutter, CNC hot wire foam cutter, CNC embroidery machine, UV printer that applies color to 3D surfaces, and related software.  Co-Works also includes more "traditional" fabrication technologies such as vacuum formers, large format 2D printing, industrial sewing machines, and sergers.  Through technical demos and class projects, students are trained in the proper use of many of these tools as time and interest dictates.  &lt;BR&gt; The course explores the theoretical implications of this technology and situates it within the context of contemporary art and design practices. Through slide presentations, readings, class discussions, and visiting artist lectures, students are encouraged to think critically about the role of digital tools in contemporary art and design and in their own practices.  Students develop hybrid approaches incorporating both "traditional" and "new" processes.  Class projects encourage experimentation, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration as well as provide opportunities for individual exploration.  No prior experience with 3D modeling or digital fabrication is required.  Participation from all majors and departments is strongly encouraged.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course is open to all graduate students.

   <COURSEDESC>Film and graphic design share an omnivorousness that devours all other media, and achieving mastery in either can fill a lifetime. Not coincidentally, similar questions are central to both forms: the careful deployment and control of image, color, text, tone, pacing, editing, communication, history, taste. the list of overlaps is long.  &lt;br&gt; Through a series of small exercises and short readings, culminating in a self-initiated multi-week project, this class seeks to offer a route into exploratory filmmaking that builds on the training and knowledge of a graphic designer. Skills will be learned through demonstrations and collaborative problem solving. The presumption is that projects will be executed in a film format, but this is not a requirement. Emphasis will be on finding a way to address problem solving in an unfamiliar time-based medium in a way that works for you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop will use the processing programming language to introduce students to programming concepts. Students will not only learn the fundamentals of the processing language but will research contemporary working methods around programming and explore the ways in which algorithms affect the design process. The aim of this workshop is for students to develop procedural literacy and to open their design work to indeterminacy, interactivity, generative processes, participatory working methods, and new opportunities afforded by technology in general.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective,Graphic Design majors, non-majors by Dept Permission &lt;br&gt;&lt;i/&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Photography plays an important role in the field of graphic design -- within publications, posters, electronic media, etc. Because of the camera's availability and fairly inexpensive cost, photography has become one of the most popular hobbies in the world. Although he/she is in possession of such a device, the average person is not entirely aware of certain image manipulations and other concepts used by the graphic designer. This four-week workshop introduces designers to the lighting studio and the many uses of the camera in creating design artifacts.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective, Graphic Design majors, non-majors by Dept Permission&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Today, we take the computer for granted. Yet for 500 years, the most popular method for word processing (or typesetting) was letterpress printing. Students will be introduced to the Type Shop through the techniques and procedures for setting and printing metal and wood type on the Vandercook proofing presses. Engaging in this historic craft, newly developed skills will be transformed into contemporary results. Exercises in form, counterform, repetition, texture, color, and transparency will be explored. Experiments will result in projects such as a poster, broadside, ex libris, or small book. Specifications on paper selection will be discussed and samples of letterpressed books will be shown for inspiration.  &lt;i&gt;Major elective, Graphic Design majors; non-majors by Dept Permission&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Requirement, Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department;course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students should complete the Design Studio track with a developed sense of self, and able to start framing questions and lines of inquiries of their own. End forms will be more emphasized than in Design Studio 1 and 2, in part as evidence that craft and working methods are sufficiently evolved. The twice-a-week format is intended for juniors or advanced designers who have completed the first two semesters of Design Studio or an equivalent "design principles" track.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications.&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Design is an ever-expanding field that demands students be accustomed to constant change and requires the development of confidence and core competencies for life-long practice. Students will learn to identify design opportunities and areas of inquiry within question-based units framed by the faculty team. &lt;BR&gt;  Each unit will vary in length, and will begin with a particular question to kick-off the process. For each unit, students will move through research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping and will be asked to communicate their findings. Units will increase in complexity over the four semesters, and are sequenced to move from a guided process to more open, self-generated methodologies. Units will be inquiry-based, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes to open questions. &lt;BR&gt;  By the end of the year, each student should be in tune with his or her own working methods and will have the ability to frame projects independently and with self determination. Inherent in the course format is a kind of elasticity and nimbleness that should allow for group projects, social &amp; cultural engagement, and formal investigations instigated through a variety of faculty-posed questions. &lt;BR&gt;  Some examples of the questions (prompts) students receive might be: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?  or How can you prevent people from texting while driving? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Requirement, 3-year MFA Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department;course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course is based on the premise that the narrative shaping of information is fundamental to human communication. As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Design is an ever-expanding field that demands students be accustomed to constant change and requires the development of confidence and core competencies for life-long practice. Students will learn to identify design opportunities and areas of inquiry within question-based units framed by the faculty team.&lt;br&gt;   Each unit will vary in length, and will begin with a particular question to kick-off the process. For each unit, students will move through research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping and will be asked to communicate their findings. Units will increase in complexity over the four semesters, and are sequenced to move from a guided process to more open, self-generated methodologies. Units will be inquiry-based, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes to open questions. &lt;br&gt;  By the end of the year, each student should be in tune with his or her own working methods and will have the ability to frame projects independently and with self determination. Inherent in the course format is a kind of elasticity and nimbleness that should allow for group projects, social &amp; cultural engagement, and formal investigations instigated through a variety of faculty-posed questions. &lt;br&gt;  Some examples of the questions (prompts) students receive might be: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?  or How can you prevent people from texting while driving? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement: 3-year GRAPH MFA students Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications.&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate  Students Only. Graphic Design Majors Only or by special permission if space permits&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FORMS AND SYSTEMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>System thinking reflects the fact that human beings are intrinsically organizers and pattern seekers due to an apparent drive within us toward wholeness and integration, toward a sense of order, harmony and unity in everything. It's therefore no surprise that system thinking plays a role in every part of design, without exception.&lt;BR&gt;  This course unpacks that notion of system: 1) as a way of looking at an object and its interaction among parts (e.g., pattern, grid, proportion, symmetry; rhythm, narrative, information architecture, networking, etc.); 2) as an inquiry that reflects the process for design (such as in formulating rules for a kit of parts), and of design methods (to conceptualize, to generate means for innovation, to cope with change, and to embrace chance and synchronicity).&lt;BR&gt;   While systems theory opens up to a vast territory of potential interest (e.g., social, cultural, environmental, etc.) we will focus on the dynamics of the visual language and the process of design to broaden awareness and deepen insight into the nature of complexity. All assignments remain flexible to allow for personal interests, needs, means and use of tools, and facilitate individual inquiries including degree project and graduate thesis work.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective;Graphic Design majors only,&lt;br&gt; Open to Junior and above&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Typography, the physical shaping of language, resides at the center of the discipline of graphic design. Typography I is the first in a sequence of three courses that covers the fundamentals of typographic practice, both as a technical skill and an expressive medium. This course is an introduction to the basic principles of typography-its theory, practice, technology, and history-through the study of letterforms, page composition, proportion, hierarchy, contrast, type identification and classification, and questions of legibility and aesthetics.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY IN 3D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The use of typography in the 3D space is a compelling one. With both a strong formal dimension and an informational function, typography will provide a coherent program with a real sense of order. If it is applied with a comprehensive system, this sense of unity allows for better communication. The typography display in the space is built with different parts related to one another by a system. In order to understand the nature of a very well organized typographic program, our point of view must be fundamentally structural. Such an approach allows us to discern the sophisticated underlying relationship between parts which creates a sense of wholeness.  &lt;BR&gt; This Cross-disciplinary course will offer the students of Interior Architecture and Graphic Design the opportunity of working with typography in 3 Dimensional Space.&lt;BR&gt;   Students will apply the use of proportion, hierarchy, and legibility in two aspects of the 3D space: A Wayfinding project and a Museum Exhibition. &lt;BR&gt;   The course will explore the methodology required to work with typographic systems in the 3 Dimensional environment, applying the narrative aspect of information. Specific attention will be devoted to exploring the methodology of designing in different scales and the ability to translate 2 dimensional content to a 3 Dimensional display. Studies will include setting text in small and big scales, the use of grids, and the application of a comprehensive system.   &lt;BR&gt; This course will be concerned with the process which controls the structure and properties of applying big scale typography and further students understanding of how applying information typographically can challenge a space. Through formal, geometric, and spatial analytic processes, students will build systems with two considerations: The interdisciplinary planning and design process between an Architect and a Graphic Designer as well as the application of a Sign System within the Adaptive Reuse project. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Also listed as INTAR 3198.

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTAL PUBLISHING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Publishing has never been a fixed notion. "What is publishing today?" remains a relevant inquiry, but with an increasingly expanded field of response, as platforms, channels and modes of production mutate and multiply. Let's begin with the post, exposing its origins as a physical note publicly nailed to a piece of wood. Its descendants persist today, plainly visible on the wall, in the feed and in the stream as traces of a deeper history of documents - the scriptural economy.   &lt;BR&gt; Is posting (always) publishing? We'll examine substrate, blankness and the possibility of saying nothing as a post-media publishing strategy. And as certain legacies recede (privacy, authorship, copyright), how is publishing still "making public?" Let's unpack (and entangle) these and other ways to explore the public circulation of work in a post-digital space. We'll draw trajectories to and from the emergence of the networked artist in the 20th century, into the last twenty years, and particularly around the last two, as self-publishing becomes more and more inseparable from the artist's ambient practice (and work) itself. &lt;BR&gt;   The semester will be devoted to the creation of our own performing publishing studio, disseminating work as a highly diffused, ongoing performance, rather than discrete events. The development of publishing manifestos and projects, working in public, research-based exploration, non-traditional tools and platforms, experimentation and collaboration will be encouraged. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graphic Design majors only; open to seniors and graduate students &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>X,Y, AND Z</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will involve a range of collaborative exercises, inquiries, experiments, lectures, readings, screenings, site visits, and projects, that explore graphic design as a multidimensional and spatial discipline. 3D, not 2D. Graphic design as object, as projection, as display, as gauge, as structure, as installation, as sound, as architecture. Not just the X and Y, but also the Z axis. The course's subtitle is "Graphic Design in Space", a literal example being Carl Sagan's "Pioneer Plaque", the sum of humankind and space travel etched in pictographic form onto a pair of 9 × 6 inch aluminium plaques attached to NASA's Pioneer 10 probe on its 1972 mission to planet Jupiter. We will also investigate more terrestrial, yet equally literal, types of space and how they relate to the human body: pages, screens, rooms, buildings, and cities. A wide range of periods, fields, and figures will be surveyed: from the likes of Leon Battista Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albrecht Dürer, to Le Corbusier, Charles and Ray Eames, and Tauba Auerbach. Ultimately, we'll consider graphic design as orthographic: an anthropomorphic system, both dimensional and semiotic, that operates within, embodies, and interprets space. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Open to senior and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As technologies advance, the integration of the physical and digital becomes more common. Screens are integrated into space, objects gain intelligence, places respond to us, and XD is quickly developing formulas to address these new opportunities. XD integrates communication and the built environment, shaping experiences which orient, inform, educate, or delight an audience. This course not only asks how we can best guide meaning within the XD practice, but asks how we can keep graphic design's strongest objectives at the forefront of our own practice, helping to shape the discipline in the future. How can we blend design disciplines to orchestrate spatially located experience? How can we synthesize image, word, sound, built structure, human movement, and audience contribution into impactful moments? The course will cover experiential, conditional, and participatory design techniques and pull in some cognitive psychology, behavioral economics, and sociology to better understand audience motivation. Project prompts will allow for a broad range of subject matter. Scale of projects will range from handheld to inhabitable, favoring human scale and slightly larger. Project content will range from complete narratives to crowd authored content. Project completion will range from prototypes/proposals to final installations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors; non-majors by Dept Permission&lt;br&gt; Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes.

   <COURSETITLE>BOOKMAKER: EXPLORING HYBRID MATERIALS, METHODS AND IDEAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an exciting time for book makers. The designer encapsulates numerous roles in the creation of a publication: content generator, typographer, printer, binder, editor and publisher. Gutenberg may have started the revolution in the 1400s, but the form of the book is anything but antiquated. With ever-changing technologies and sophisticated materials, the potential for the book and its distribution has only expanded.  &lt;BR&gt; Through a series of exploratory exercises including hybrid forms of printing and binding, students will continually use content as the primary consideration as they challenge historical precedents and traditions. Artists such as H N Werkman, Alfred Tolmer, the Italian Futurists,  David Pearson, Sara DeBondt, Julia Hasting, Irma Boom, and others provide differing models and perspectives on the form of the book.  &lt;BR&gt; Students will visit printing and binding sites to explore possibilities, experiment with various output devices - including digital printers, silkscreen, letterpress and polymer technologies, laser cutting, both traditional and experimental materials, and bindings to position the book into contemporary hands. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective: Graphic Design majors; non-majors by Dept permission.&lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Charts and graphs have an indisputable aura of objectivity and yet, much like statistics, they can use this power to either elucidate or mislead. What makes an information graphic 'trustworthy' and how do designers know that their work is telling the 'whole story'? In this course we will deal with the mechanics of collecting &amp; processing data from the local environment and the larger world. Eschewing the expected line graphs and pie charts, students will explore different ways of communicating the data's meaning in a quantitatively rigorous and visually engaging way. Projects will involve the use of scripting languages, web scraping, databases, and other numerical tools to transform data into something that is understood rather than simply 'seen'. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to Graphic Design majors only, Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPUTER UTOPIAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The goal of this studio is to reimagine the personal computer. &lt;BR&gt;  Three decades ago, the Macintosh dropped a sci-fi bomb on pop culture. It advertised a utopic vision of human-computer creativity to mass audiences. By remixing military-industrial-academic fragments, a product company sold the dream of new humanism. This decade, the planet is bursting with smartphones; billions of people will carry globally-networked pocket computers, each outfitted with sensors that datify the material world. We now have quantities, rates, and kinds of data unlike anything humankind has ever seen. Individual biological minds can't reason at network scale, so we're teaching fields of computers to do it instead.  &lt;BR&gt; If the data center is today's mainframe, is there a Macintosh hiding in the next decade? If your phone's camera is the next mouse, what will it click on? As machine learning reinvents humanism, what are 21st century creative tools? What do network literacy and 21st century citizenship look like? Is the programmer/user dichotomy destroyable? How much of this is just a design problem? &lt;BR&gt; We'll explore these topics with studio work and seminar-style discussion. Studio work will include creation of mockups, videos, webmedia, interaction design, and beyond. Prototypes and design fictions are welcome. Programming experience is not explicitly required. Sincere eagerness to rigorously engage and reorient computer culture is a must. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;br&gt; Graphic design majors only &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SITE SPECIFIC UX</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>For many living in cities, everyday life is interwoven with digital and network related experiences. These experiences often carry with them particular local, site-specific design challenges. This course begins with a question: How can User Experience Design (UX) help local users better engage with their environments and each other?  Beginning with a site in Providence, R.I., the course will utilize the principles of UX, including user research, rapid prototyping and testing, to create designs that address real challenges for local users. Key topics and areas addressed will include site specificity and program, user and site research methodologies, behavioral psychology, communications strategy, the politics of interface design, testing and iterative design methods. Course participants will create working prototypes to be tested by users in conjunction with final design proposals.  Works may range in scale and form, from paper to devices to built environments. No previous coding experience is required. Depending on feasibility, prototypes or final designs may be deployed on site. &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;I&gt; Major elective, Graphic Design Seniors and above; non-majors by Dept Permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EDITORIAL DESIGN FOR THE SCREEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How can you draw on your foundations in graphic design to make reading experiences for the screen? What aspects of the craft translate, and what needs fresh exploration? This class covers basic HTML/CSS, wireframes, and flow diagrams, but it is not about "designing and coding a website." Students will learn to compose dynamic forms, tell engaging stories, and make meaning in digital environments. After experimenting with a series of form-led studies, the course turns to narrative design on screen. What are the components of a story? What are the needs and expectations of digital readers/viewers, and how can we design reading experiences that both serve and stir them? Where is the overlap between reader experience and user experience, between graphic design and product design? The semester's work not only engages the challenges that editorial web designers and digital storytellers in the industry face today, but asserts that designers should continue to re-think and re-assert their practice, whatever the future brings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Major elective; Graphic Design majors only &lt;br&gt; Open to seniors and above  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C503. Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology across Asia, Africa and the Americas will be explored utilizing the RISD Museum of Art with frequent visits to the textile and costume collections. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Students will also have opportunities to examine various methods of textile display, analysis and storage appropriate to items of cultural heritage via case studies of specific objects in the RISD Museum.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be preregistered by the department&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IDENTITY IN FLUX: PHOTO PORTRAITURE FROM DAGUERROTYPE TO SELFIE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the history of photographic portraiture since the "invention" of the medium in the 1830s up to the present day. Particular attention is given to exploring the ways that identity is created, reinforced, or deconstructed through the limits and capacity of photography. How does photography transform the way identity is constructed through imagery in the early years of its history? How has photography shaped the formation of subjectivity in portraiture? In what ways does photography challenge or reinforce cultural and political hegemony by "representing" a person? How have digital photography and social media transformed the ways that an identity is constructed and shared by others? To answer these questions, examples of photo portraiture, from vernacular to artistic modes and spanning the globe, will be assessed. Each class will focus on theoretical debates on identity and subjectivity in relation to the given topic, with an interdisciplinary approach incorporating art history, cultural studies, critical theory, memory studies, postcolonial theory, and area studies. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.</COURSEDESC>

We will read interviews with them and analyses of their work, watch documentary films, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role autobiographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Cindy Sherman, Ana Mendieta, Faith Ringgold, Marina Abramovic, Shirin Neshat, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Maya Deren, Frida Kahlo, Leonora Carrington, Agnes Varda, and Francesca Woodman. Students will do weekly readings; write weekly papers, as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

It will also focus on the range of issues that museums in general are currently addressing such as ethics, provenance, audience, and architecture. There will be visits to storage areas with curators to understand the scope of the collection, as well as sessions on topics such as conservation, education, installation, and exhibition development. Written assignments will include preparing catalogue entries for recent acquisitions, developing gallery guides, analyzing current exhibitions and/or devising proposals for reinstallation of the permanent collection. The course is designed particularly for those students who have had little behind-the-scenes experience in museums.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as GRAD 500G 01 with limited seating for graduate students desiring graduate seminar credit.

   <COURSEDESC>French Surrealism played an important role in the development of 20th-century European and American art.  The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORIES OF PHOTOGRAPHY II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Part II of a two-semester course that will survey major topics in the Histories of Photography. Emphasis will be given to the diverse cultural uses of photography from its invention to the present day.  Such uses include: the illustrated press; amateur photography; studio photography; industrial; advertising, and fashion photography; political and social propaganda; educational and documentary photography; and photography as a medium of artistic expression.  Much attention will be paid to how photographs construct histories, as well as being constructed by them.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Required&lt;br&gt; Liberal Arts Elective credit (LAEL)for majors as well as nonmajors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>METHODOLOGY/HISTORIOGRAPHY: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassaï's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMMES FATALES &amp; DOMESTIC NUNS: IMAGES OF WOMEN IN 19th and 20th CENTURY WESTERN ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

Readings will include selections from Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and take into account return stories such as the Odyssey.  Art with Trojan iconography will be explored from ancient vase-paintings and sculptures through Renaissance and Baroque depictions, up to a contemporary graphic novelization and a brief discussion of films on the subject.  Major themes include the interaction of art and literature, and the mutability of an established narrative at the hands of subsequent creators.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCOCO ROCKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A key moment and place in the history of design, eighteenth-century art was innovative and rich in criticism, especially in France. Favored themes in the graphic arts and sculpture include gallantry (fetes galantes), eroticism, and domesticity. French art dealers were responsible for new designs for furniture and decorative arts; architects developed utopian projects; and seamstresses launched extravagant fashion trends. We will examine how rococo came to be the dominant artistic trend in all Europe and the kinds of controversy that it generated from the mid-century on. Rococo Rocks will provide analytical tools for understanding the visual arts within their social and critical contexts including the Enlightenment. We will navigate between genres and media, assess how works of art were then perceived, and discuss the position of women (whether mothers, wives, or artists). We will also study the ramifications of rococo?s continuing curve into twentieth-century art from Art Nouveau to Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons.&lt;BR&gt;   Visits to several departments of the RISD Museum are planned as well as to the Hay Library where we will study original eighteenth-century illustrations. Students? final projects consist in designing a rococo-inspired object in any medium (painting, sculpture, textile, print, or drawing) accompanied by an artist?s statement.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RITUAL PERFORMANCE IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores how art articulated the many rituals that permeated the Italian society from ca. 1350 to 1550. Ephemeral art and fragile objects that were only sporadically displayed (processional ones, for example) are rarely discussed in art history. Well-orchestrated events for birth, marriage and death were held in domestic or outdoor settings; citywide processions meant to ward off the plague or to honor a local saint, and political events such as princely entries or funerals flaunted colorful paraphernalia such as precious textiles, costumes, flags, statues, and decorated tapers. These gatherings often staged the performance of music, chanting and prayers, or religious drama. The art of public ritual not only created authority and expressed devotion but it also asserted one's rank in society, and maintained social order. To understand these phenomena, we will examine inter-disciplinary methodologies in art history from material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. One field trip to Boston is planned.</COURSEDESC>

The early wooden buildings are represented in relief and paintings, as well as elaborately replicated within the ancient cave monasteries across India. This course traces the Indian architectural tradition, its transformation into a symbolic vocabulary for a new structure, the Hindu temple, and the development of the temple in India from ca. 500-1500 A.D. Students will be encouraged to explore the social, historical, and symbolic frames for this architecture. While introducing students to the remarkable variety of India's temple architecture, its multiple forms and uses, class discussions will also address broader issues of how architecture can be designed to compress meaning while accommodating multiple agendas of use.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course investigates the role of the artist on The Grand Tour, a cultural pilgrimage through France and Italy made by British aristocrats during the 18th century. Improved infrastructure for tourism and the excavation of antiquities in Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum opened up new markets for artists and offered unique opportunities for them to capitalize on their study and training in Italy. Artists set up studios and workshops in Rome where tourists commissioned portraits, prints, sculpture and decorative objects. Eventually, study on the Grand Tour became an essential component of an artist's education and practice.  Students will examine a variety of artworks produced during this pivotal era (and into the 19th and 20th centuries), both in Italy and at the RISD Museum, that represent the dynamic cross-cultural relationships between tourists and artists.  The goal of this course is to connect students with a transitional period that solidified links between critical making and art-historical scholarship.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;  There is a &lt;B&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/B&gt; trip to Rome over Spring Break.

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY AND MILITARISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography became especially popular as a vernacular and political medium around the time of the Crimean War in the nineteenth century. Since then, photography has been a critical medium that represents, commemorates, propagates, opposes, and complicates war and militarism across the globe. Histories of photography in the twentieth and twenty-first century have also unfolded through colonization, genocide, war, liberation, globalization, and war on terror. Militarism has thus been crucial to the medium's history: photography does not merely re-present the militarized life-in-the-making; it is an integral part of it. This course examines the ways in which the subject of photography has emerged through not only war but also what we will call "everyday militarism." Organized thematically according to photographic subjects, this course will closely investigate selected bodies of photographic work with readings on war, atrocities, subjectivity, ethics, and iconicity. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  (This seminar is recommended for concentrators in History of Art and Visual Culture and for students especially interested in drawing.) &lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will explore artworks and art-collectives which aim to share in a social activity since the 1990s.  Nicolas Bourriaud's theory argued in &lt;I&gt;Relational Aesthetics&lt;/I&gt; (1998, English translation 2002), as well as those of his critics will provide context.  Additionally we will examine public-facing, artist-run projects, with roots not only in everyday life but also in the specifics of local communities as we chart art and activism in contemporary social environments. The course will conclude by investigating the artist-as-entrepreneur model, and its place within social innovation and the cultural sector.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will survey the emergence of an avant-garde in the United States during and after World War II.  The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ART OF ART CONSERVATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How does a museum preserve its art collection? How do art and science reinforce each other in this field?  Does the approach to the conservation of ancient art differ from that of the conservation of contemporary art?  How and why do materials composing visual art deteriorate?  Which environmental factors adversely affect organic and inorganic materials first or fastest?  In this course, the student will gain an understanding for the five agents of deterioration, for issues of physical and chemical stability regarding organic and inorganic materials chosen by artists over the millennia, as well as how the care and handling of art differs in some respects for a museum than for a working artist.   Frequent visits through the museum exhibits, storage, and the conservation lab will demonstrate key concepts covered in the class.  Ethical issues regarding the determination of the original intent of any given artist as well as ethical issues regarding forgeries and looted art will be discussed.  Assignments will focus on the RISD Art Museum's collection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Restricted to HAVC concentrators or MA candidates in Museum Education&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course will explore the approaches and contexts of Leonardo da Vinci's draftsmanship. Studying primarily some of his surviving 6000 drawings and notes, the course will locate his aesthetic and analytical processes and contexts for a broad range of projects, such as paintings, sculptures, treatise literature, machines, weapons, maps, festivals, built environments, and studies of natural philosophy. We will also examine theoretical pursuits in the liberal and technical arts by Leonardo and his contemporaries, and their assessments of visual art as a science, and studies of natural science as a systematic art. Particularly informative will be Leonardo's responses to contemporary trends, to artisanal traditions, to the antique, to members of princely courts and republics, and more generally to investigative and inventive strategies.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Junior and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Each kind of writing about art demonstrates (or "performs") certain skills and syntaxes to a historically situated audience. Students will inquire into many and diverse rhetorics (or "performance strategies"), from key texts in academic art history to blogs and videos, critical exhibition reviews to socio-theoretical manifestos about art and culture. Students will apply writing techniques to works of art / design / architecture / visual culture that sustain their interests.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Economic, social, and cultural institutions, forms of entertainment, and communal relations that enriched daily life in Istanbul are addressed. This look at the pleasures of the city is counterbalanced by an examination of the vicissitudes of violence, disease, and natural disasters which ravaged the residents of Istanbul across the Ottoman centuries.  The last part of the class addresses the transformation and modernization of Istanbul in the nineteenth century and its place in the Republic of Turkey in the twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergradutes&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This experimental course offers students the opportunity to seriously explore some topic or question in history, philosophy, or one of the social sciences, which has a bearing on their degree project. Students will be guided through the process of formulating a research project, identifying the relevant literature, critically reading that literature, and working out how the HPSS material (content and/or methodology) can deepen and enrich their studio practice. We'll look at some artists and designers who have made these sorts of connections and but spend most of the time in discussion of student work. Coursework will be tailored to the needs of individual participants. To obtain permission to register for the course, send an email to the instructor with the following information: your name, major, year in school (junior, senior, graduate student), and a description of (a) your studio degree project, as you currently conceive of it, and (b) the area, topic, or question in history, philosophy, or the social sciences that you want to explore. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to juniors, seniors, 5th year, and graduate students.

   <COURSEDESC>This course looks at key issues relating to migration, displacement and refugeeism in the world today. It frames these issues in terms of the factors which force movements and restrict the movement of people across national boundaries. It considers both the causes and consequences of such movements in relation to legal, political, economic, social and cultural factors.  It looks at the images of citizen, nation and state that are constructed through the regulation of national boundaries, and compares these with the goals, identities and cultural processes of the people who move or are across regulated borders. In working out how to think about people who live at the edge of conventional social science categories we will reconsider such basic concepts as ethnicity, identity, nation, culture and homeland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Religion has long been a part of human life. Prehistoric burials include utensils and companions (sacrifice) for life in another world. Early writings pray for divine intercession or advise how to win divine favor.  Are beliefs such as these in survival after death and in supernatural beings reasonable?  Philosophy of religion asks this of these beliefs and others: Is belief based on experience (mysticism) and not argument reasonable?  Can the divine be proved to exist by argument, or proved not to exist (or care) by the prevalence of suffering?  Does the supernatural intervene in nature (miracles)? These and other questions will be examined through reading classic and contemporary writings, lectures, discussion, and student presentations.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PSYCHOLOGY OF EVIL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evil has long been a topic of study for theologians and philosophers, but has only recently been studied by psychologists. Although evil is an inherently subjective topic, we will attempt to take an objective, scientific approach to understanding why people engage in evil behavior. Thus, we will begin by attempting to suspend the notion that we can divide the world into good and evil, and instead understand the situational and psychological factors that could lead anyone to harm others. Specifically, we will focus on classic psychological studies that show how everyday people can be led to act in deplorable ways by manipulating the situational circumstances. We will also discuss how inter-group processes can lead to conflict and large scale acts of violence like war and genocide. Finally, we will study the nature of the psychopathic personality in order to better understand those individuals who feel no guilt or remorse for harming others (e.g., brutal dictators and serial killers). This is a very interactive class and will require you to contribute in discussion and prepare an in-depth presentation on an area of your own interest related to the psychology of evil.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the form and function of the human body, with a focus on the musculoskeletal system and surface form. Each week, we will cover a different area of the body, working our way through the trunk and limbs to the neck and head. For each area, we will first consider the anatomical structure, including the bones, muscles, nerves, arteries and veins. We will then study the function, including movement, systems and processes. Each area will be further explored through common injuries and syndromes with an anatomical basis, which are illustrative of function through dysfunction. We will discuss treatments with an anatomical basis, including typical surgical approaches and procedures, and the design of prosthetics. Through this course, we will demystify and develop an appreciation for the wondrous  complexity of the human body and its role in art and design. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will explore questions of sexuality formation in a sociological but not a biological sense and also look at the ways in which sexuality and gender intersect. Some knowledge of Western history will be very useful (but not formally required) for this course. Readings will be extensive. Attendance and active vocal participation are required, as are exams and an out-of-class essay paper. Sophomore and above.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Socrates described philosophy as an intellectual preparation for death.  He recognized that how we react to, think about, and cope with finality tells us a great deal of what we think about the core of our existence.  Philosophers have been divided between a "bald scenario" that death is nothing but the end of our material existence to which we are limited, and the more reassuring view that death is a door to another personal plane of existence.  Death is nothing vs. death is everything.  We will examine these phenomena from philosophical points of view through reflection primarily on philosophical works but will include religious sources and literary works.  While philosophers have primarily focused understandably on the individual confronting death, we will constantly place these questions and their answers within interpersonal and social spheres of consideration.  We will focus on: What is Death? The role of death in the meaning of life; personal survival in various scenarios; ethical issues surrounding suicide, euthanasia, and other voluntary ending of life.  We will look at a few of the social practices surrounding death and examine their meaning and functionality. Intensive reading, writing, and participation in seminar format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

Beginning with an introduction to the historical Buddha and the basic principles of his teaching, the course will briefly examine the main branches of Buddhism that were established after the Buddha's death.  With this as our foundation, we will then look at how Buddhist principles are put into practice in different societies.  The course will focus on how Buddhism in practice (like all religions) is always part of broader cultural processes, with distinctive characteristics and significance in different societies.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING AND MESSAGE: INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF SIGNS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We live amid a world of signs without which we could scarcely communicate or find our way through life.  The theory of signs, or semiotics, seeks to understand the nature of signs as vehicles of meaning in our perceptions and messages we send and receive in our spoken, textual, and visual communications.  This course moves from the analysis of signs and communication to a critical examination of the extension of semiotics to the surface and hidden meanings of dreams, handwriting, literary and art works.  At each step, we will endeavor to test the theories "in practice," to carefully evaluate their merits and limitations.  Through this, semiotics will emerge as a humanistic discipline that underwrites our critical and creative understanding of the world as well as funds our creative efforts to make the world anew.  Problem-based, discussion and lecture oriented with quizzes, practice-assignments, and short papers.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

While the templates for creating new works were discarded over time, the music of Middles Ages, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Modern periods is still with us. This course aims to foster listening imaginatively to feel the music in its historical setting not just by learning what to listen for, but also in understanding its internal organization and how it related to the cultures in which it flourished. Class will involve some group singing, performances, listening, lecture and discussion. The course uses quizzes and exams to test your grasp of the material and requires several short papers.  No prior musical experience or training is required. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Philosophy after Alexander the Great differed from what had gone before. Gone with Alexander were the small, self-governing communities in which each citizen had a place and a role to play. Secure in such communities, citizens had begun to philosophize in a disinterested search for knowledge. The conquests of Alexander brought into being a world-empire extending from Greece to India, Egypt to Kazakhstan. There were not citizens of this empire but unconnected and atomistic subjects of a foreign bureaucracy whose lives had been uprooted from all vital community. In such circumstances, people began to look to philosophy for answers to new questions: questions about their place in the world and the meaning of their lives. This course will examine the alternative communities that philosophy after Alexander offered to a vast, disenfranchised, and multi-ethnic population, preparing the ground for the new world-religions of Christianity and Islam that were to follow.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This introductory course provides a broad overview of the major content areas within the field of psychology (e.g., physiological, developmental, social and cognitive psychology) and will introduce you to the psychological theories and research used to understand human behavior. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including how people learn, process and store information, why people possess distinct personalities, how social situations and cultural norms affect our behavior, how we grow and develop throughout our lives, etc.  Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the merit of classic psychological theory and research in understanding people's thoughts, feelings and actions in real world situations. This course will provide a broad knowledge base for those interested in taking upper level psychology classes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for Undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Composed of a mix of lectures and discussions, this course begins with a series of foundational lectures on important events and themes in Middle Eastern history prior to 1800 (such as the emergence of three monotheistic religions in the Middle East - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the rise, formation, and expansion of Islamic States in the early-modern period such as the Ottoman and Safavid/Persian Empires).  Moving quickly into the modern period, this course focuses in equal measure on the Arab Middle East, Iran, and Turkey.  The historical roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict are also addressed.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: MATRIX OF WISDOM: PHILOSOPHY &amp; SCI-FI</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Philosophy, the quest for wisdom, seeks answers to life's deepest and most enduring questions.  How should we live?  What is the truth?  What is real? What and who are we in a universe of things unlike ourselves?  At its core, philosophy is a discursive, argumentative probing that pokes at our fundamental assumptions about the world.  The philosophical mind, of course, welcomes the challenge.  In addition to philosophers raising these questions, fiction has been a vehicle for raising these issues and challenging the status quo mindset of its readers.  Science fiction in particular, has long been occupied with questions regarding man's place in the universe and the limits and potentials of science.  While such philosophical probity rarely makes for great television viewing, there are a few shows, such as Star Trek, The X-Files and others, that are distinguished by their consistent philosophical texts in conjunction with the study and discussion of selected episodes from these extraordinary television series.  Participation, several short papers and group presentations are required.</COURSEDESC>

In a profoundly significant sense, each of these was or is British.  In many areas, a few islands off the coast of Europe known as the British Isles have managed to exert a powerful influence over much of European and Global history.  So much so that one wag, paraphrasing Thomas Hobbes (an Englishman) claimed that life in a state of nature was "nasty, short, and British."  We will pay close attention to the major currents of Modern British history including: industrialization, social customs, Anglo-Celtic interactions and the formation of a national British identity, overseas ventures, class conflict, sexual politics, and democratization.

Some films, and other creative expressions, reflect an inherent endorsement or criticism of the politics contemporary to them.  We will examine social critics' roles in some of the influential movements of the West in the 20th century--the Russian Revolution, German Nazism, the New Deal, World War Two, the Cold War and Third World Liberation movements.  Requirements include readings and screenings from each of the eras covered, written assignments and exams, and participation in class discussions.

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will examine many of the ethical, social and philosophical issues raised by ongoing developments in the brain sciences. With improved understanding of how the brain works comes new powers for understanding, monitoring, and manipulating human cognitive, emotional and behavioral functioning; such new powers have potentially profound implications for the law, social policy, clinical practice, and personal experience. Topics to be covered will include: moral judgment and decision making, freedom of the will, moral and legal responsibility, use of psychopharmacology for enhancement of mood and cognition, the neural basis of pro-social and anti-social behavior, neuroimaging and privacy, the use of neuroimaging data in courts of law (e.g., to assess truth-telling and the accuracy of memory), brain injury and brain death, the development of neurotechnologies, and the importance of ethical and social guidelines.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course is an introduction to studies of the plant kingdom: its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips and outdoor class assignments, will focus on observation of plant morphology,  adaptations to environmental conditions, as well as observation of plants as they transition out of dormancy. Students will learn to identify plants through recognition of morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Documentation of observations, through the use of field journals, will reinforce the importance of scientific record-keeping.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

It also examines individual leadership potential by exploring how personal affinities can be focused and developed into effective strategies for solving problems, advancing ideas, and making change. Finally, it considers ethics, especially looking at the ways leadership can solve human problems. While primarily focused on public issues, this course will consider leadership in all economic spheres, and will look at the ways artists and designers practice leadership. In addition to reading, classroom discussion, and writing assignments, students will complete a community-based project in Providence. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Witness trees, as designated by the National Park Service, are long-standing trees that have "witnessed" key events, trends, and people in history. In this joint studio/liberal arts course, students have the unique opportunity to study and work with a fallen witness tree, shipped to RISD from a national historic site. The course will involve three components: 1) a field trip to the tree's site at the beginning of the semester; 2)classroom-based exploration of American history, memory, landscape, and material culture; and 3) studio-based building of a series of objects from the tree's wood, in response to both the site and students' classroom study. Overall, the course will explore both how material artifacts shape historical understanding and how historical knowledge can create meaningful design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Students will receive 3 credits in Furniture and 3 credits in HPSS, for a total of 6 credits.&lt;br&gt;  A single fee of $100.00 will be charged for your concurrent registration&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Providence is a dynamic city, with a complex history and a wealth of individuals and community organizations working to make the city a better place to live and work.  This course looks at Providence and its neighborhoods through the stories of people involved in making change happen.  It is designed to introduce students to processes of community engagement through the collection and presentation of oral histories.   Students will identify an individual or organization working on a project of interest to them and, through a series of oral history interviews, learn how individuals work to bring about change in complex economic, social, and cultural circumstance.  The course will focus on learning about community engagement and development, recording and editing oral history interviews with key players involved in change, and developing a final project based on these interviews that can contribute to the work of the organization or change agent.  It will involve the exploration of unfamiliar neighborhoods and issues, significant out of class work setting up and conducting oral history interviews, and close attention to the language people use to express themselves.  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The various ways "meaning" can be construed, both objectively and subjectively, in everyday life and in the philosophical arena will be explored. Literature, film, and philosophical texts will be used as vehicles to illuminate how reflection, experience, and transitions through life's stages influence assignment of value to one's existence.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMINIST THEORY AND ACTIVISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Some complain that feminist theory is "too academic," that it has no ties to social justice or activism. On the other hand, there are those in the academy who accuse gender/women's studies of not being sufficiently academic, of not being intellectually rigorous. With those two stereotypes in mind, we will read a variety of feminist theorists, some generally thought of as "academic," and some generally seen as "activist." Can academic theory be useful to political and social activists? Can activism inform academic theorizing?  With those questions in mind, we will look particularly at feminist theories and activism as they seek to counter, contextualize, and respond to war and other manifestations of violence; theories and activism around reproductive rights and justice; theories and activism addressing environmental justice and ecofeminism; and theories and activism around bodies and their relationships to the other issues we will examine. Throughout the course, we will keep in mind art's place within feminist theory and activism.</COURSEDESC>

We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In most advanced cultures of the world, the passion for sports has reached into many and unexpected aspects of society.  As participants or observers, we all, at one time or another, recognize the power of sports as spectacle, distraction or metaphor.  This course will examine the evolution of sport from competition among individual athletes in the ancient world through the rise of team sports in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It will then consider the influence of sports on language, politics, gender identity, art and architecture, literature, media, and apparel, among others.  Sports inevitably have an interrelation with class, race, and nationalism; and they have developed their own myth &amp; ritual &amp; hagiography, aesthetics, economy, cult of celebrity and statistical idiom.  There will be readings, assigned papers, classroom presentations, an exam and field trips to local sports events.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HAVC C503.

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to explore the relationship between sacred "texts" (including those that have been transmitted verbally for generations) and the images that are associated with them and/or inspired artists in their traditional contexts. We will look at the cultural context of sacred narratives in such communities as the Kwakwaka, the Hopi, the Maya and other Mexican communities, the Dogon, Australian traditional aboriginal groups, and other Pacific communities, time permitting. Topics will include sacred texts and landscape, sacred narratives and the notion of a person, sacred texts and contemporary arts, and other related topics. The course will require a final research project.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HAVC C504. Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL INEQUALITY, LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will explore the interdisciplinary subjects of global environmental justice, environmental racism, and other environmental inequalities. The primary goal of this course is for students to comprehend the multiplicity of critical issues, debates, and responses within global and local environmental justice. We will discuss and analyze environmental justice as a movement that involves marginalized communities in diverse ways in a globalized world. Using case studies, this course will consider examples of toxic distribution and exposure, accidents and disasters, regulatory failures, barriers to political participation, and the commodification of land and labor. The course will identify contemporary responses to environmental inequalities including grassroots local and international advocacy, climate justice, food justice, indigenous rights, ecofeminism, and Julian Agyeman's concept of "just sustainabilities." The class will travel to a unique brownfields and envrionmental justice restoration site on a Native American reservation in the Hudson Valley.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HOW TO DO THINGS WITH ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing on Searle's book Speech Acts and Ian Hacking's Social Construction of What?, this course will engage students, as a class, in the creative development of a theory of art acts.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;BR&gt; Our exploration will have three stages. First, we will consider the theory of speech acts and theories of social construction as models for doing such things with works of art, as expressing feelings, documenting facts, raising consciousness, or asking questions. Second, students will research and present for discussion and analysis chosen examples of art acts, making use of the RISD Museum as well as the internet and the RISD Library. And finally, each student will make a work whose presentation constitutes an art act. In this way, theory will inform interpretation and making; and interpretation and making will inform theory.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RUSSIA: PAST AND PRESENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to introduce students to the history and culture of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union.  The themes that will be developed in the course include: the historical process of imperial formation, transformation, and collapse; the spatial dimension in Russian imperial history; Islam in Russia; reform, modernization, and "westernization" in the Russian context; migration and human mobility; and political violence and revolution.  The question of Russian "national" identity, both historically and today, will be an over-arching theme of this course.  From a methodological perspective, therefore, the themes and topics addressed in this course are designed to help students contextualize contemporary economic, political, and social developments in the Russian Federation. &lt;BR&gt;      This course is organized around assigned readings and in-class discussions designed to isolate and illuminate the various scholarly and disciplinary elements embedded in RISD's art and design curriculum.  In combination with engaged reading of the assigned textbook for the course and the content provided through "mini-lectures", films, videos, and literary works will serve to extend the imaginary and visual dimensions of the course.  The reading and discussion of historically-based works of literature within the context of Russian history as well as the viewing and discussion of a film on contemporary Russia will, therefore, help elucidate and humanize the various themes developed in the course.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

After a design object is absorbed into the production process, global supply chains are involved in the global system of organizations, people, processes, and resources that transform raw materials into finished products. Additionally, this complex process and network is responsible for delivering finished products to consumers and the disposal of related waste. In this course, we will first lay a foundation for understanding global supply chains, drawing from political science, economics, and management. Next, we will engage in critical analysis of the process and network with respect to issues that include human rights, gender, the environment, and labor standards. We will correspondingly examine the roles of actors such as governments, firms, consumers, international organization, and non-governmental organizations involved in global supply chains.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will move between science, art, and everyday innovation and explore their resonances and differences. We will ask: Why and how do we innovate? What does it mean to innovate? What are the historical and geographic conditions, and the tools and technologies that enable innovation? In this day and age of celebration of entrepreneurial activity and creative collaborations: we ask who is read as innovative and what are the limits of the innovative endeavor? &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the study of behavior and mental processes, psychology allows us to better understand how people think, feel and act. This introductory course provides a broad overview of the major content areas within the field of psychology (e.g., physiological, developmental, social and cognitive psychology) and will introduce you to the psychological theories and research used to understand human behavior. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including how people learn, process and store information, why people possess distinct personalities, how social situations and cultural norms affect our behavior, how we grow and develop throughout our lives, etc.  Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the merit of classic psychological theory and research in understanding people's thoughts, feelings and actions in real world situations. This course will provide a broad knowledge base for those interested in taking upper level psychology classes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for Undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Is there such thing as a 'Neo-Avant Garde'? Hal Foster argues that throughout history, artistic 'avant-gardes'have been brought on by societal upheavals. Artists often take on the role of activists, using their abilities to translate stories visually to inform the public about socio-political issues. In this class, we will be looking at artists that have used their platform as makers and creators to advocate for social change. This class will be broken down into three sections: Politics, Appropriation, and Mediation. Students will research how they compose themselves and how they react to their surroundings. Weekly readings will be discussed in class, as well as used to initiate 'debates'. Students are also expected to research contemporary artists that address issues regarding issues surrounding class, race, and gender to bring to class discussions. Readings include excerpts from Angela Davis' 'Abolition Democracy', and Robert Klanten's 'Art &amp; Agenda: Political Art and Activism' as well as other assorted readings.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for Undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course offers an overview of the interdisciplinary field of environmental psychology. We will explore the dynamic relationships between people and places in order to understand how our behavior and cultural values shape our environment, and how in turn, our surroundings affect us. Using the lens of environments where we live, work and play, we will examine the everyday experience of different types of places including the home, institutional settings, public space, and play spaces. Attention will be placed upon social and spatial inequalities, local and global relations, and intersections of race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and power. We will explore psychological questions of perception, place identity, culture, place attachment, cognition, and the meaning of spaces through readings, film, visual exercises, and environmental analysis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as APPAR 2494 for Apparel majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications I is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on design research methods. Together, we will spend the fall semester casting about, planning and prototyping towards some kind of design proposal or product for execution in the spring. We think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. On the tool for design side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We use writing to help clarify and crystalize the thesis plan. On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of writing and how to think about what they want and need. We talk about the thesis as a tool for explaining the design but also as a tool for helping you advance your career goals. At the end of the course,you will have a partially complete draft of your thesis. which will set you up for an excellent spring. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Must also register for ID 247G &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design department; course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Together, we will spend the spring semester finishing the thesis and thesis book that you proposed at the end of Graduate Thesis Communications I. We continue to think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. For this course, we put more emphasis on the communication aspect.&lt;br&gt;   Together, we will continue to refine and strengthen the manner by which you explain your thesis to yourself and others. We will think about audience, voice, structure, and form. We will explore different ways of communicating the same idea in different contexts and mediums (visual, oral, written). We will examine how to share our work and with whom.&lt;br&gt;  At the end of the course, you will have a complete thesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Course Goals/Learning Outcomes There are two main goals for this course. 1. Become a better communicator. 2. Finish your thesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   The first will involve spending time thinking about what it means to you to be a better writer, and practicing the skills needed to make that happen. The second is pretty straightforward.&lt;br&gt;   Course Organization/Method of Instruction We will run this studio as a workshop of peers, working in teams of one and providing one another with assistance and support. This is a highly collaborative class and the exercises and work that we do will shift and respond to the needs of the group. We expect you to take the lead in identifying your needs and goals and in supporting your peers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, ID graduate students only&lt;br&gt; Must also register for ID 248G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are using in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt;  Course Goals/Learning Outcomes There are three main goals for this course. 1. To become a better writer. 2. To become a better presenter. 3. To develop writing and speaking towards becoming a better designer.     All will involve spending time thinking about what it means to you to be better at these things, and practicing the skills needed to make that happen. &lt;I&gt;Graduate major reuirement; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WOOD I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Philosophically, the ID Department believes that students become better designers when they have an intimate knowledge of a range of natural and synthetic materials. In this course, students will learn about the properties of natural wood and engineered wood-based materials, investigate the related technical processes, and evaluate how this information is both connected to and influenced by the design process. Students will work with materials directly and master skills needed to manipulate these materials. They will develop projects that allow them to engage in the design and development process, promote creativity, problem solving, and the correct use of materials. Facility procedures, safety, and care and use of tools and equipment will be stressed. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this class we practice a variety of digital and freehand methods of design exploration and visual communication used by designers. These sketching and rendering skills are ideal for anyone who has to understand and resolve form while communicating ideas within interdisciplinary environments. We will focus on the redesign of a few objects, starting with some sketching from the ideation phase through to a final solution that describes the aesthetic and emotive intents, as well as demonstrates knowledge of functional or unique manufacturing requirements. The class is built on the belief that strong two-dimensional skills remain the essential tool for product designers.  &lt;BR&gt;  Students attending the first module will be required to participate in the final critique on the final day of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt;  This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor-- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business&lt;BR&gt;  The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  This course will consist of a series of lectures, readings and case studies from the Harvard Business School.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WKSHP: DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this class we practice a variety of digital and freehand methods of design exploration and visual communication used by designers. These sketching and rendering skills are ideal for anyone who has to understand and resolve form while communicating ideas within interdisciplinary environments. We will focus on the redesign of a few objects, starting with some sketching from the ideation phase through to a final solution that describes the aesthetic and emotive intents, as well as demonstrates knowledge of functional or unique manufacturing requirements. The class is built on the belief that strong two-dimensional skills remain the essential tool for product designers.  &lt;BR&gt;  Students attending the first module will be required to participate in the final critique on the final day of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this hands-on course, students will learn the basics of Processing, an open-source coding language that combines computer programming with form, motion and interaction. Students will learn the fundamentals of Processing to create interactive graphics and visualize data in a collaborative workshop setting. By the end of the four-week module, students will have learned to design, implement, and trouble-shoot their code, providing a solid foundation that will allow them to continue their learning after the class ends.  &lt;BR&gt; Students will be required to participate in the "laptop farm" group exhibition on the final day of the semester.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS COMMUNICATIONS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications II is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio courses which focus on completing your thesis. Together, we will spend the spring semester finishing the thesis and thesis book that you proposed at the end of Graduate Thesis Communications I. We continue to think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. For this course, we put more emphasis on the communication aspect.&lt;br&gt;   Together, we will continue to refine and strengthen the manner by which you explain your thesis to yourself and others. We will think about audience, voice, structure, and form. We will explore different ways of communicating the same idea in different contexts and mediums (visual, oral, written). We will examine how to share our work and with whom.&lt;br&gt;  At the end of the course, you will have a complete thesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Course Goals/Learning Outcomes There are two main goals for this course. 1. Become a better communicator. 2. Finish your thesis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   The first will involve spending time thinking about what it means to you to be a better writer, and practicing the skills needed to make that happen. The second is pretty straightforward.&lt;br&gt;   Course Organization/Method of Instruction We will run this studio as a workshop of peers, working in teams of one and providing one another with assistance and support. This is a highly collaborative class and the exercises and work that we do will shift and respond to the needs of the group. We expect you to take the lead in identifying your needs and goals and in supporting your peers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, ID graduate students only&lt;br&gt; Must also register for ID 248G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are using in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt;  Course Goals/Learning Outcomes There are three main goals for this course. 1. To become a better writer. 2. To become a better presenter. 3. To develop writing and speaking towards becoming a better designer.     All will involve spending time thinking about what it means to you to be better at these things, and practicing the skills needed to make that happen. &lt;I&gt;Graduate major reuirement; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The aim of the course is to open a window on the complex and multifaceted present design environment. A preliminary overview about the major historic design movements will be followed by an extensive description of the design's state of the art together with a spot on the latest trends. Students will be invited to think and tinker, learning how to approach a design project, how to formulate proper research questions and how to use analog and digital prototyping to experiment, validate and communicate their own ideas. They will also initiate a dialogue with forms, functions, and interactions, defining the borders of the design activity and the actual role of designers. The main goal of the course is to get students familiar with the design vocabulary and with the basic tools involved in design processes.   &lt;br&gt; Areas covered: Ideas and concepts creation, quantitative and qualitative research, sketch models making, digital fabrication, physical computing, project's narrative and storytelling.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to ID Graduate Majors only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN FICTION-RAPID PROTOTYPING WITH TEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There is an element of fiction in all design work and design is always about the future - it imagines the time when the objects and services we make become available to users - but design fiction goes further. Design fiction is a genre of experimental and speculative design that uses the tools and techniques of storytelling to develop conceptual prototypes of near future ideas.   &lt;BR&gt; Writing is cheap. It takes moments to describe an object that could take hours or months to build. This allows you to prototype ideas quickly, lightly testing and discarding so that only a much more promising subset of ideas makes it to the physical creation stage.  &lt;BR&gt; Drawing from the techniques of science fiction and the foresight community, we will explore how world and scenario-building can be used to enrich our designs. We will experiment with the tools of fiction and genre to examine our ideas from new angles and to find new ways of presenting our concepts to an audience. We will also consider the pitfalls and shortcomings of the approach.  &lt;BR&gt; At the end of the course, we will present a series of near-future prototypes for better living in strange new worlds.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSEDESC>This class will cover basic camera optics and lighting techniques necessary to generate high quality digital images for either print or digital portfolio applications. The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MISSION: MATERIALIZING SOCIAL MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From an Instagram food post to paying our friends for last night's pizza run via Venmo, social media has become the transcendental interface to our alternate personas, the facilitator of distant relations and hypocrisies, and one of the defining symbiotic/parasitic relationships of our time. Even in this day and age where social media encompasses our daily living, the boundaries, repercussions and future manifestations of the relationships occurring within it are still undefined. `Mission' focuses on the observation, study, and speculation of social media as undefined networks which house relationships between man-man, man-machine, &amp; man and self. These relationship studies will manifest themselves in the form of writings and multi-dimensional maps which will give way to designs portraying the understanding and control of such affinities. `Mission' will give students (Mission Personnel) the ability to express/explore their own experiences and interest within the under explored digital society. This course is designed for students with interests in systems thinking, speculation, multi-dimensional representations, and critical theory. &lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN FOR FICTIONAL LIFE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will read great works of literature and create designs that are inspired by fictional worlds, respond to them, and bring them closer to our own. Students will conduct writing of their own, read short stories, and design a final project inspired by one piece of fiction. The course challenges students to think how fiction has a place within our world, and how the issues authors are working out in their texts are design challenges. How are the struggles the fictional characters face related to issues facing our own clients, family, friends, and world? How can we think of the novel as a design, and what lessons can be learned from literary structures to enhance our own design practice?  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This is a reading, writing, and making intensive class and students are expected to engage thoughtfully with the assigned material. We will use the literary concepts of style, setting, character, metaphor, allegory and symbolism as design prompts, and respond to a number of texts throughout the course. Ultimately students will choose one novel to work from as their final project and will create a product based on that novel. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIOPHILIC TINY HOUSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will design and build a full scale model of a tiny house that is 150 square feet using the principles of biophilic design and human factors. Students will focus on the interior space of the house in order to explore the connection and placement of objects that create a unified habitable space. The objects and furniture must be able to store flat, move, transform, or serve multiple functions. We will enact tiny house scenarios (prior to building) in class and study our own behaviors/habits with mapping exercises - to determine adequate minimum requirements for living. In order to accomplish this, we will begin by studying the philosophy of Victor Papanek, followed by a brief survey of architecture, and precedent studies of tiny houses. There will also be a detailed investigation of human factors, biophilic design and biomimetic design. The tiny house will be designed and constructed to meet the specific needs of an assigned client of instructor's choosing. Students will be encouraged to build their tiny house mock-ups using recycled, cardboard and alternative materials. This is an opportunity for students to come up with daring ideas and to push the limits of what is perceived as a functional living space. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in visualizing, and also to bolster students' confidence in their ability to write small programs to accomplish useful goals. The class will use Python; a general-purpose object-oriented interpreted language one can use for countless standalone projects or scripting applications. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.&lt;BR&gt; Also offered as FAV-1539.

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is visual communication: meaning made visible. Visual thinking, the creative process by which all successful illustration is created, constitutes the development of an articulate imagination through thorough, iterative exploration of ideas. This class emphasizes process over finish, idea over application and significance over style-exploring both ways of seeing and ways of showing. Coursework will encourage conceptual invention and application fundamental to an understanding of what the practice of illustration is and can be. The object of the course is to strengthen the students' inventive talents and interpretive skills - and thereby to augment their ability to articulate complex ideas with clarity, eloquence and power.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated  manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. Emphasis is placed on Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with a critical brief to be handed in upon exiting the class. Additionally there are weekly readings, 2 tests, and a longer research project. There is no textbook for this class. However, students will be able to access study images and readings through Artstor and on RISD Digication.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Rather it will seek to provoke insights that are best expressed visually and verbally, as humor. Humor as the means, not the end, of the illustrative gesture. A funny-bone to pick.&lt;BR&gt; Assignments will include inversions of expectation, the uses of the inappropriate, the various guises of the satirical, of parody, single frame cartoons, black comedy. Wit. ("Wit" is merely insight made delightful). These will seek to elicit from the student a series of illustrations that will be as self-descriptive as any portfolio, as definitive as any 'style'. Humor is intensely idiosyncratic, personal. But when it 'works', when it achieves its audience, it is a particularly intimate and effective means of communication. In other words, illustration.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;br&gt;  This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT'S YOUR STORY?</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When we choose a story to read, retell, or illustrate, that choice reveals something about ourselves. What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING WITH COLOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Color is arguably the single most expressive and mysterious tool available to the artist. However, many artists who are skilled in black and white drawing have difficulty when they turn their hand to color. Crayon creates a bridge, which is at once less intimidating than more traditional media, while at the same time capable of producing highly sophisticated imagery. Through classroom exercises an awareness of the transformative power of color is awoken. Limited color underdrawings are further developed with multiple layers of color. The use of warm and cool color relationships as well as the exploration of polarities of color, in order to create rich, dramatic effects, is examined in depth.&lt;br&gt; Class work gives the student the opportunity to work from the live model.  For homework, the student is encouraged to engage in subject matter which has personal significance, perhaps something one had always wanted to create but hadn't had the opportunity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Throughout history, the natural environment has been a subject of charm and awe for the artist, from the delicately painted frescoes in ancient Roman homes to the 16th century, when the landscape transcended the role of 'background', and gained momentum as a sublime subject in its own right. This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>At their very core, all books convey a sequence of ideas, but the execution varies widely from one volume to another. In this course, juniors and seniors strive to extend this concept outside of traditional book parameters to achieve their own creative interpretation. Working from their own themes, students mold an innovative presentation of images and concepts in two dimensions or three, using concrete depictions or abstract forms in the construction of their own unique artist's book. Assignments include the study of different folds, narrative problems, poetic counting, lost and found, and a free project of the student's choice. Students are encouraged to continue their own media that might include painting, construction, printmaking, etc. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to play is a complex activity that is at the core of human learning. From Monopoly to poker, Doom to the baseball diamond, games allow us to explore social interactions, take risks, set goals, develop skills and expand our imaginations while entertaining us without serious consequences. What makes a game fun? Or memorable? In this class, we will explore the intersections of learning, experimentation, and play. In our constructed projects, we will search for innovative ways to expand or reinvent game traditions. Through individual and collaborative projects, we will examine how game mechanics (rules/systems) thoughtfully combined with game aesthetics (visuals/story) can be used to craft engaging, memorable and informative user/player experiences. Our goal is to develop primarily non-digital games that are conceptually innovative responses to various questions you pose related to play. Quality assurance and usability concerns will be explored through focus group play tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>COWORKS: 3-D ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While most illustrations are flat, working in three dimensions allows for the engagement of a whole new range of material and conceptual possibilities. Whether using traditional materials or digital technologies, sculpture is enormously nuanced in what it can suggest. In this class we will examine how objects and various sculptural strategies can be used to convey complex concepts and ideas. A survey of contemporary sculpture and 3D illustration will provide plenty of conceptual, process and material exploration. The class is offered in conjunction with RISD CoWorks to promote experimentation, interdisciplinarity, and access to advanced technologies. Projects are structured to introduce you to a variety of materials and methods of working, including paper manipulation, box making, character design, model-making, 3D printing, and lazer-cutting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Additionally students will learn how to light and photograph three-dimensional work for reproduction or portfolio. The class promotes development of personal expression, strong conceptual solutions, excellent craftsmanship and good design. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PROJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to bring a creative project to a full and successful level of finish is often neglected in the academic environment, but is an essential professional skill. This course requires that students meet goals they set for themselves through individualized projects, but that they meet them fully with the highest degree of resolution and polish. In a written proposal, each student will present his or her project for the semester: a graphic novel, a series of paintings or drawings, a children's book, a suite of prints or posters. Work may be in any medium, in any format and on any theme, but these parameters must be clearly established at the outset. Work on the project will be conducted in the studio during class time and outside of class, and will be focused on full realization of a finished product that meets the specific standards established in the original proposal. Consistency and quality of execution will be the goal, and less successful or preliminary pieces will be re-worked to elevate them to the level of the project as a whole. Students will have one-on-one crits each week and group crits as needed. Finally, students will mount a professional-level juried exhibition of the completed projects in the ISB gallery, with an emphasis  on presentation, marketing and a public opening.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration seniors; open to Illustration juniors and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FANTASY PAINTING: THE STUFF THAT DREAMS ARE MADE OF</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From the disturbingly exotic pictures of the Underworld by Hieronymus Bosch and the twisted visual puzzles of M.C. Escher, to the mid-20th Century comic characters of Stan Lee and classic 1950's science fiction films, fantasy images provide a rich source of inspiration for the contemporary artist/illustrator. In this course, we will study the art of Surrealist artists such as Magritte and Max Ernst, the unique fruit and vegetable portraits of Archimboldo, investigate the abstract dream imagery of Hilma Af Klint and Carl Jung, and the seminal graphic novels of Sue Coe (Porkopolis) and Art Spiegelman (Maus). We will interpret text and film as we create our own fantasy paintings working with appropriated imagery, collage, and painting mediums such as oil, acrylic, gouache and watercolor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING II: THE ARTICULATE FIGURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>This course will continue the study of color organization and use of the oil medium begun in the fall semester, with increased emphasis on compositional structure and adjustment. Assignments will feature imaginative or hybrid compositions, combining observed and invented components. Using principles of color, directional light and spatial structure to solidify atmospheric unity, we will explore the implication and construction of narrative.  Work in class will solidify the student's ability to evoke volume, space and light.  We will examine the breadth of creative choice in representational color use to illuminate the expressive qualities of various options. &lt;BR&gt;   Students will study the role for color in directing the viewer's navigation of a composite subject, or imbuing a simple image with depth and complexity. Color design is introduced as an abstract structure that underlies figurative imagery, providing an important expressive subtext. Quick compositional studies in casein or gouache of a work in progress will be used to focus atmospheric and spatial effect. The historical development of  color use in painting and cultural associations of style will be explored in slide lectures and experimentation.   &lt;BR&gt; A capstone assignment will tie the principles of color and composition to a large narrative painting combining diverse imagery from reference and imagination, and emphasizing clarity and subtlety of structure in service of personally determined content.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Portraiture in oils doesn't simply begin and end with a likeness. In this class we will explore ideas and techniques employed by great painters since the Renaissance to create truly lifelike representations. We will begin with limited color underpaintings and thereby establish the basic image which frees us up to explore color through glazing. As the semester progresses we will move on to opaque painting techniques and finally to thickly applied paint using the palette knife. Emphasis is placed on color mixing and the use of a limited palette. We will examine how color can convey life and how this can be achieved through the use of subtle warm and cool color relationships.&lt;br&gt; Although the assignments are essentially figure and portrait related, the student is given great latitude in the choice of subject and how it is handled.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SILKSCREENED POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since before the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsides" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors sophomore and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course (previously entitled "The Art of Communicating Science") invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. &lt;BR&gt; Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed  for a public space or public interaction. The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;br&gt; Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912 and will receive 3 elective plus 3 LAEL credits.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISIBLE CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A society's history is written in its stones. From the dystopias of Gotham City or Grand Theft Auto, the hive mind of the Borg and the ecstatic asceticism of the Shakers, to the suburban conformity of Levittown and the Sphinx half buried in sand, every city, every society, is an embodiment of ideas, history, geography, and beliefs. Each built environment has its own logic, both architectural and cultural. With some provocative writings about the phenomenon of the city as inspiration, you will be asked to conceptualize a place and bring it to life visually. The essence of a city - its buildings, pathways, public and private spaces - depends on how you define the character of its people, its government, its history, its geographic siting and even its language.&lt;BR&gt; After defining a back-story in broad strokes, you will begin researching the implications of those choices visually. Working from thumbnails and sketches to finished conceptualization, you will explore compelling physical and conceptual viewpoints, with a variety of possibilities in the use of media and technique. Rather than limiting ourselves to purely pragmatic architecture, the class will be searching for imaginative visualizations, where form becomes poetic metaphor suggestive of narrative.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE TWO-LEGGED PRINT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is meant to give students an understanding of the process of serigraphy.  Using the basic American T-shirt as the format, emphasis will be on creating and developing a concept: learning and implementing the techniques of silk-screen in order to produce wearable illustration.  The course will also include historical and contemporary issues on the phenomenon of the printed shirt, including uses ranging from social protest to advertising and the use of the body as a substrate for images.  A variety of techniques will explore everything from simple handmade stencils to the use of photo/computer technology to create individual designs.  Assignments will be given through the developmental phase, and in-class critiques will play an important role in determining the final product.  By the end of the semester, students will also investigate the business/commercial side of silk-screening, including at-home studio setup, recordkeeping and selling the product.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Weekly assignments combine illustration objectives with a playful spirit of exploring materials for its own sake. Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.   &lt;BR&gt; Techniques with paper pulp, polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (as low-relief and over armatures). Scavenged objects and supplies to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations are another way to create images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished with mixed media, collage and other treatments that unify the whole. Idea and technique come together so these illustrations will be anything but shallow.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we examine gender -- not your biologically assigned equipment, but those social constructs that shape and define what is male, what is female and what is that less absolute space between and beyond. Weekly assignments often begin by reviewing the traditional role of women and men in American culture but through a contemporary lens, examining the astoundingly colorful range of gender and sex identities that cannot be limited to simply pink and blue. We'll turn stereotypes inside out, flip popular icons upside down, and rework familiar images from hallowed museums. We'll search for fresh depictions of abstract concepts like conception, contraception, relationships, power, etc. This course offers equal opportunity for XX's, XY's and those outside the binary..&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;BR&gt; Open to everyone during Wintersession&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WRAPAROUNDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It may not be wise to judge a book by its cover; illustrators can clearly be judged by theirs. The creation of a successful book jacket requires conceptual flare, illustrative dexterity and design sensitivity- in addition to a dramatic imagination. The jacket illustration must, like a poster, arrest the attention of passers-by; it must also, like a work of art, convey subtleties specific to the work it encloses. It must resolve visually the paradox of being both carnival barker and intimate confidante at the same time.  This course will require the student to construct a portfolio of solutions in various genres of publishing: Mystery, Science Fiction, Literature, Non-Fiction, Biography, etc. Particular attention will be given to the successful integration of type and image essential to each genre. Such work may serve as the nucleus of a larger portfolio requisite for freelance work in this field, or as an adjunct to a professional portfolio of editorial illustration.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORKING ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a survey course designed to enable students to develop a wide body of work in three-dimensional moving art pieces. Students are exposed to a large range of types of movement and the challenges inherent in getting those movements to operate smoothly. The pieces are made from a wide range of materials, including but not limited to wood, cardboard, wire, metal, plastic, Sculpey, and paint. &lt;br&gt; There are three elements in each project: the idea, mechanism and surface treatment. Assignments will be given based on the mechanism. Students bring the subject and story to the piece. The mechanisms covered include: action/ reaction, balance/ counter balance, whirlygig, cams and cranks, motion-triggered lights and sound.  Molds will be incorporated into the assignments. All projects are painted. &lt;br&gt; This course requires students to develop a working knowledge of a range of tools, from simple hand tools to more complex tools available in our wood shop. Exercises and focused workshops on tool usage will be a fundamental part of the class.  Prior experience with tools is helpful but not necessary. &lt;br&gt; The class culminates with a "Come Play With Us" show of students' completed projects. Elementary school children and the RISD Community are invited to play with the pieces, with an emphasis on fun. The projects have to work; they need to be built to withstand all types of child's play.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE VISUAL ESSAY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will a create comprehensive visual essay on a topic that they propose. Participants will engage in extensive investigation and create a series of images that explore, reveal, and/or explain a particular subject or concept. Emphasis will be placed on the development of content through research, and the organization of consistent refined works through presentations that synthesize ideas as pictorial or graphic imagery that may include or refer to textual information. Final presentations may be printed, digital, exhibited as originals or include cross-platform or time-based imagery.  A wide range of commercial applications and opportunities will be explored. &lt;br&gt; The semester will begin with short projects that introduce useful skills and approaches. The remainder of the term will focus on a single conceptual endeavor. Contemporary and historical examples of visual essay will be examined and discussed. Student research may lead beyond campus. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustrators invent all the time: a "concept" is nothing more than invention. This course aims to expand the illustrator's definition of and capacity for invention, both on the page and beyond. The object of invention herein is delight. Students in this course will conceive and develop three distinct projects - the for children, the second for adults, the third at the student's discretion. Each project in development will test its premise: it will expose inspiration to proof. The ultimate criterion for success, whatever form the project has taken, will be, "Is it delightful?". If an invention is both original and delightful it may well have commercial potential; while this is not the object of the course, commercial potential will of course be considered. Classes will ideally be of seminar size. They will consist of speculation, discussion, suggestion and critique: skull sessions. Such dialogue is essential to the generation and development of both premise and project; it will comprise the majority of class time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Changing Narrative will explore the challenges and possibilities of innovative storytelling structure: non-linear, interactive, multimedia. In this class, students will create inventive work at the intersection of physical and digital media, the old and the new. Students will be introduced to classic dramatic structures across cultures-Asian Kishotenketsu, Freytag's pyramid, Shakespearean tragedy-and learn fundamental digital skills via class demonstrations and exercises. Drawing from these patterns and tools, students will then seek to unveil new storytelling possibilities granted by modern technology (computer animation, touch screen interaction, hypermedia) to traditional artforms (illustration, comics, gaming). What happens when a comic's panel starts to move? Where does a story go if the reader is allowed to make decisions? Students will investigate these creative avenues and create playful, hybrid stories.&lt;BR&gt;   Along the course of the semester, assignments will notably include short-form animated illustrations, experiments with gamebooks and cartoon strips, culminating in a final, long-form narrative project.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LARGE WOODCUT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the world's first print technique, woodcut had a profound affect on the development of all printing -especially the Japanese woodblock process which has influenced so many artists. It uses minimal technology, requiring only a sturdy table, a few simple cutting and inking tools, and a wooden spoon to print the block. Despite the simplicity of the medium, resulting prints are as individual as the artist who makes them. An artist is able to make many identical prints of their image, which makes woodcut a great tool for experimenting with your ideas. Whether you enjoy work with a bold graphic quality or a delicate organic line, woodcut is an ideal medium for those that enjoy the physicality of materials. The class will cover the basics of woodcut prints to gain an understanding of the three components of this process: color separation, carving, and printing. Participants will learn about the required materials and tools, how to safely and effectively cut an image into the woodblock, and how to print it. The class will focus on how to organize and print large scale, complex, nuanced multicolored woodcuts. Reduction and multi-block techniques will be shown as a means of developing personal imagery. This one-of-a- kind course gives students a traditional printmaking skill that is environmentally friendly, can be done at home, on any scale.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMALIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Animals have enjoyed a prominent place in art for as long as humans have been creating it, beginning with the caves in Lascaux. Along the way they have figured prominently in myths fables and allegories, enjoyed starring roles in a wealth of picture books, and appeared as frequent players in visual metaphors employed by editorial illustrators. This course will provide opportunities for students to engage with any of these forms and also find their own approach to working with representations of animal life.  There will be in-depth exploration of creature anthropomorphism and its uses- from social and political satire to its capabilities in a wide range of storytelling methods. From JJ Granville to Spiegelman's Maus, to children's book greats like Richard Scarry and Arthur Geisert, the human-animal/animal-human is an enduring motif that will continue to be reinvented and expanded upon. Students will have the ability to channel projects and assignments towards formats of their choosing - including painting and other gallery-based practices, children's publishing, artist books, comics and zines. &lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ILLUSTRATIVE TYPOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustrated typography and hand lettering are enjoying a wonderfully prominent place in the visual landscape of design, publishing  and illustration, and have become an increasingly vital part of many illustrator's professional portfolios. What can illustrated type and it's particular characteristics provide as an alternative to established typefaces? How does an illustrator find the right balance between form and function, expression and readability? This course will provide the opportunity to employ drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, photography, digital tools and other media in the creation of unique letterforms. Students will be encouraged to experiment with non-traditional materials -including three-dimensional ones. Beginning with an introduction to basic typographic elements, terminology, and font families, students will move into creating their own unique lettering for projects including posters, book covers, and packaging.  Typography will be the central focus, but students will have leeway as to the degree with which it is integrated with other illustrative imagery. Along with these projects students will create a complete unique typeface over the course of the semester. Relevant issues related to hand drawn text-type for comics, picture books, and graphic novels - including appropriateness, readability and voice, will also be covered.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURING SOUND: MUSIC + ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration, along with painting, printmaking and many other visual art practices, is continually intertwined with music. From illustrators collaborating on videos, packaging and promotion, to creating graphic novel and picture biographies of musicians and musical movements, the tradition of connecting the visual to the acoustic has a rich history. &lt;BR&gt;   Music will always need to be celebrated larger and in a more tactile way than on a screen-we are seeing the enduring inventiveness of the gig poster, and even the 12" LP cover is still alive as a canvas. Projects in this class will explore promotional, interpretive, and investigative approaches as they relate to musicians, lyrics and titles, as well as parallels between music and visual art. Students will have the chance to interpret musical works in a number of ways, including through narrative approaches, using sculpture, animation and GIFs, and other less conventional means.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be exploration of analogous aspects of music and visual art-sound and color, time based works, performative aspects and related ideas (e.g.: the movements of the hand while drawing/painting as analogous to playing an instrument). There will be some focus too, on genres and movements where music and art have close relationships, ie: psychedelia, pop and op art, comics and set design.  Lectures and discussion will also be devoted to learning about artists who create both visual and musical work.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students take on the role of the reportage illustrator and visual essayist by developing a series of images in a sketchbook journal, on site, with emphasis on observation, documentation and investigation of non-fiction subject matter. Finished art will be created for a number of the investigative assignments as well as a completed stand-alone visual essay of a self-generated topic. The long tradition of illustrative reporting will be examined and discussed, as will the contemporary manifestations of journalistic art in print and in digital formats. Emphasis is placed on authorship, concept, and drawing skill development afforded by working on site are also a focus.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors sophomore and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAGON CONCEPT &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, IN 3-D MIXED MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course begins with the investigation of dragons, compelling monstrous and mythological creatures found throughout the history of art in various cultures. Students will research historic forms and consider the purposes dragons and other monsters serve, in preparation for designing and building their own "dragon." Various theories of aesthetics relating to sculpture will be presented. Demonstrations will show how readily available non-toxic materials like cardboard, wire, wood, plaster, papier-mâché and cloth can be transformed into evocative forms, with much time devoted to experiments with materials, paints, patinas, and finishes. A premise of the class is that working in three dimensions exposes previously unrecognized opportunities and weaknesses, and creates new paths for learning. At the end of the semester, each student should have a superbly conceived and crafted object that expresses their own individual vision. Emphasis will be placed on how well the object succeeds in fulfilling or illustrating a storyline or narrative developed by the student.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the major architectural personalities working in Europe (Italy, France, England, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands) and in North America in the period 1800 to 2010.  Areas of study will include an examination of adaptive reuse related issues that will be studied in the context of their social, political, technological, and economic circumstances, as they pertain to the design culture of the period. Special emphasis will be given to interior renovations, additions, transformations and other interventions of adaptive reuse.  Other areas of study will include the development of architectural drawing, and the way in which designs often evolved through committees, or ongoing consultations among patrons, designers, administrators, and scholars. Attention will also be given to design theory, and the doctrines relating to site, orientation, proportion, decorum, and the commercial design market.&lt;BR&gt; This course will be conducted in seminar form with discourse and discussions at the graduate level.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major Requirement: MDes&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE FOR NON-MAJORS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is primarily intended to provide some insight into the design objectives of the studio projects of the undergraduate and graduate degree programs of Interior Architecture at RISD.  As a studio introduction to Interior Architecture for non-majors, the course will focus on the spatial design concerns of the department focusing on how one carves, creates and occupies built space. Projects will explore the realm of work that begins with an architectural volume and transforms it from the ill-used or obsolete, to new purpose and viability, presented in drawings and models.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY IN 3D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The use of typography in the 3D space is a compelling one. With both a strong formal dimension and an informational function, typography will provide a coherent program with a real sense of order. If it is applied with a comprehensive system, this sense of unity allows for better communication. The typography display in the space is built with different parts related to one another by a system. In order to understand the nature of a very well organized typographic program, our point of view must be fundamentally structural. Such an approach allows us to discern the sophisticated underlying relationship between parts which creates a sense of wholeness.  &lt;BR&gt; This Cross-disciplinary course will offer the students of Interior Architecture and Graphic Design the opportunity of working with typography in 3 Dimensional Space.&lt;BR&gt;   Students will apply the use of proportion, hierarchy, and legibility in two aspects of the 3D space: A Wayfinding project and a Museum Exhibition. &lt;BR&gt;   The course will explore the methodology required to work with typographic systems in the 3 Dimensional environment, applying the narrative aspect of information. Specific attention will be devoted to exploring the methodology of designing in different scales and the ability to translate 2 dimensional content to a 3 Dimensional display. Studies will include setting text in small and big scales, the use of grids, and the application of a comprehensive system.   &lt;BR&gt; This course will be concerned with the process which controls the structure and properties of applying big scale typography and further students understanding of how applying information typographically can challenge a space. &lt;br&gt; Through formal, geometric, and spatial analytic processes, students will build systems with two considerations: The interdisciplinary planning and design process between an Architect and a Graphic Designer as well as the application of a Sign System within the Adaptive Reuse project. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Also offered as GRAPH 3198. Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;br&gt; Major elective: BFA, MDes, MA, restricted to Seniors and Grads only&lt;br&gt; INTAR and GRAPH majors only, others by permission of instructor &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BREAKING THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN ART AND ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Sculpture to me is like poetry, and architecture is like prose. - Maya Lin &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Art can be defined as something visible or invisible that expresses the imagination and creativity. Architecture is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings. How can art create conversations with its surrounding architecture? And how can artists and designers get involved between art and architecture? Our goal is to look at the possibility of pushing the boundaries between art and architecture through installation art which represents the intersection of those two disciplines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This class will start with case studies including works by James Turrell, Gordon Matta-Clark and Doho Suh in order to understand how artists use architectural features to let space create emotional experiences. This class will help students to recognize and utilize various architectural elements such as sound, lighting, materiality, structure and human activities. Then students will be given an interior space to spatially analyze experience as a process to explore multi-sensory programs. Final outcomes will be a collaborative full-scale installation in an enclosed room. This course will provide an opportunity for students to do a mock-up installation for RISD Dorner Prize 2017. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $70.00  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERPRET: REINTERPRET</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Born out of the Surrealist movement, exquisite corpse is a game in which participants draw on a piece of paper, then fold it to conceal a portion of the drawing. The paper is then passed to the next player who adds to the drawing without seeing the rest of the image. This continues with the paper being passed to multiple players, each building on the partially hidden preceding piece. The result is a product that is wholly unexpected that transcends individual ownership.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    In this class, we will explore the dynamics of how an idea is manifested, communicated, interpreted, and reinterpreted across disciplines, individuals, and cultures. Students will be given an abstract concept at the beginning of Wintersession and asked to translate it into a physical form. Through a series of exquisite corpse-inspired model-making exercises, each piece will change hands multiple times, allowing for concepts to be reinterpreted, expressed, and elaborated upon, eventually culminating in a collaborative, yet individualized, work. Because this is a cross-disciplinary course, the classroom will act as a laboratory in which students are highly encouraged to collaborate with each other and experiment with unfamiliar materials and making techniques. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Senior J+M Degree Project students focus on a clearly defined, individually chosen, subject of inquiry for 12 weeks. Seniors are required to take full responsibility for the evolution and articulation of their creative practice. Two faculty serve as DP advisors, meeting weekly with students, to discuss and facilitate the progress of their work. Writing exercises are incorporated into the class to support the relationship between writing and their studio practice. Although seniors must be self-reflective in identifying the individual impulses and motivations in their work, emphasis in review and discussion begins to shift from the voice of the personal to that of the greater collective, context, and role of the audience. The DP culminates in an exhibition at Woods-Gerry Gallery on the RISD campus. Graduation requirements include: CV, professionally documented digital portfolio, artist postcard, and artist/degree project statement.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department; course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FINDINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The word 'findings' has multiple meanings. It is commonly used to 	describe the outcome of research, investigation or a discovery however 	it also refers to the small tools and various materials used by an 	artisan: a jeweler's findings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This course combines investigation and discovery with learning and practising some basic skills and techniques for jewellery making that serve as a starting point for experimentation. It offers an introduction to jewellery making and thinking and looks at the way content and  ideas have developed within jewellery practice from historical examples to the work of contemporary jewellery artists. Students are invited to explore the language of jewellery with an open mind and an adventurous attitude through a series of assignments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The philosophy we will work from is Thinking Through Making which encourages students to integrate making and thinking and to allow the making process to contribute to their work in a substantial way. It aims to let coincidence and 'happy accidents' influence the way the work develops as an alternative to a more planned and controlled way of working. Basic skills and techniques that are taught include saw cutting, drilling, riveting, soldering, hammering. These can be applied to a diverse range of materials  and processes. The emphasis of the course will gradually shift during the 5 weeks from practical and technical to more experimental and conceptual.Part of the course will be guided by working on a number of briefs, after which the students will have the opportunity to develop their own project.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;   We will use Providence as a site to conduct field work, mining it for material by searching, collecting and documenting. The findings that result from this field work serve as a starting point for the student's  individual or collaborative investigation and translation of the language of jewelry. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will explore the physical and mental experience of creating jewelry pieces. Students will be challenged to recognize the creative value of putting materials and their material interaction at the center of their process for making jewelry. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the experience of a `material' in a deep and profound way, outside of ones prejudice and "Pre-perceptions". Students will have the opportunity to work with a broad range of materials: from traditional materials to non-precious, found, or even waste materials. You will be motivated to approach each material as if this was the first time that you have encountered it. This will enable the possibility to "re-learn", to absorb its unique qualities, and find ones boundaries through a truly creative and active dialogue with it. By the end of the course, students will develop and create a series of jewelry that ultimately reflect ones own unique and creative language.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MOLTEN METAL: SOLDERING, ALLOYING, AND CASTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class is an introduction to metalworking with a focus on the liquid state. Soldering, a method for bonding pieces of metal, is the result of a carefully controlled melt. Beginning with this useful technique, students in this class will experience how the temporary liquid state of metal affects its later solid state. Through careful calculations, documented experiments with casting, alloying, and fusing, and readings about the history of these processes, students will build a well-rounded understanding of metal's behavior. They will be expected to reasonably predict the outcomes of altered processes and find ways to apply this knowledge to the design and construction of jewelry and small vessels. Project designs should bring technical knowledge together with concept and considerations of scale, weight, balance, symmetry, use, and wearability.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students are encouraged to seek answers to question that arise in their process and to share all findings with the class. As a group, this class will build a body of knowledge about how metal behaves. This course will focus on metals that are suited to the jewelry studio and its equipment - combinations of silver, copper, gold, zinc (a component of brass), tin (a component of bronze), and nickel are possible.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599. Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm. MML &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURE AND WORD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A workshop-style course which combines English with a studio project for students with an interest in children's picture books.  Students will learn to develop storytelling skills (imagination, language, plot, character, and voice) and illustration techniques (characterization, setting, page, layout) by studying picture books and completing writing and illustration assignments.  For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*GUYANA: ART &amp; SCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation, located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. More specifically, this course offers RISD students the opportunity to visit a biological hotspot and consider its role in society; participate in conservation science field research; interact cross-culturally; and develop their communication skills. Taught collaboratively, this course emphasizes the importance of connecting ideas, information, and methodologies across the arts, humanities, and sciences, with an emphasis on biology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will spend the first week of the course at RISD, the next 3.5 weeks in Guyana and the last half week at RISD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take both LAEL-LE97 and LAS-E717. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits as identified by each subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies. &lt;br&gt; Wintersession 2017 Travel Cost: $3,750.00 - airfare included&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRECOCITY &amp; INNOCENCE: NARRATING CHILDREN'S CONSCIOUS IN 19TH &amp; 20TH CENTURY LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While children have long been objects of literary representation, the practice of depicting children's consciousness in imaginary literature intended for adults and the advent of literature devoted to captivating the imaginations of children both have relatively recent origins in the nineteenth century. In this course, we will read poems, short stories, and novels that privilege youthful subjectivity between 1850 and 1950 alongside contemporaneous debates about childhood, (im)maturity, and coming of age. We will ask what is at stake in the modern/ist enthusiasm for rendering children's minds in fiction. To what cultural, political, and discursive uses were children put during this period? What sorts of desires, aspirations, beliefs, and anxieties are disclosed by texts that emphasize "underage" modes of thinking and feeling? How can we understand the significance of childish fears, longings, capacities,and limitations within transatlantic culture in the decades leading up to and immediately following the turn of the twentieth century? We will consider the relationships between childhood and social institutions such as slavery, boarding school, and organized religion, examining how race, gender, socioeconomic status, and geography influenced (and often determined) the experience and duration of childhood in the United States and Britain. Throughout the semester, current theoretical frameworks such as queer temporalities, minor affect, and dependency will orient our discussions of the time and space inhabited by children, and nurtured or vitiated by their guardians, from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The game is afoot, so it is time to rely on the little grey cells. In this course we will examine the development of the detective novel in its three primary manifestations - the private eye novel, the procedural novel, and the amateur investigation. We will start out with some classic texts from Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, and Georges Simenon, then move to contemporary texts, paying particular attention to the way the genre adapts culturally as it moves from Europe and North America into Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The final project will be a collaborative writing project that will result in the class creating its own detective novel. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The word "liary" references the seven volumes of Anais Nin's diaries, which, upon their publication, were denounced by Nin's friends as utter fiction, as the "liary."  This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Photography and Literature are often seen as separate, yet kindred, disciplines, each working to depict, contest, alter, and reframe that which we think of as reality. This course will explore various ideas about the melding of photography and literature by looking at texts that work to create dialogue between the two mediums, as well as theoretical writings that offer ways of contemplating such fusions.  We will study texts by writers/photographers such as: Walker Evans, James Agee, W.G. Sebald, Sigmund Freud, Roland Barthes, Teju Cole, John Berger, Sophie Calle, Paul Auster, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Lance Olsen.  Students will write several short essays about the readings, as well as a longer project, which will combine photography and writing.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Can we prove that ghosts exist? Are aliens going to invade the earth? Will technology destroy humankind? What are scientists *really* experimenting on their laboratories? For centuries writers have explored the weird side of science in literature, exposing a cultural discomfort with scientific advancements and human interventions in nature. From Dr, Jekyll to Dr. Evil, scientists become villains threatening the population with their amoral desire to wield power over human life through experiments in bizarre pseudo-sciences such as mesmerism, vivification, parapsychology, and artificial intelligence. In this course we will read a variety of texts about these fascinating villains and the "weird sciences" they practice.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will be an intense and focused examination of Black filmmaking in the USA.  The critical journey will start with early 20th-century films, including those of Oscar Micheaux.  We will then continue on to so-called Race films, marching through the L.A. Rebellion/Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers and Blaxploitation films.  We will end with current independents, exclusive of Spike Lee and Lee Daniels.  We will analyze form, content and theoretical interventions in order to sketch, if not fill in, an artistic, cultural, and political practice that remains in the literal shadows of Hollywood and White film hegemony. You MUST be prepared to screen many films, read critical and theoretical essays, and write thoughtful, cogent papers that will help us center filmmaking practices that are too often decentered.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Berry has developed what William Least Heat Moon calls a "deep map" in a very specific region of Kentucky, moving through time to reveal changing land use and loss of (agri)culture. We will be reading Berry's work and posing questions about human responsibility and our own relationships to land and home. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO NONFICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>So much of the writing we encounter in the world falls under the umbrella of "nonfiction": memoirs, magazine articles, op-eds, travel narratives, celebrity profiles, true crime stories, biographies, personal essays, restaurant reviews, and more. This course offers an immersive introduction to the genre through reading, writing, and peer-editing assignments. Students will experiment with a number of different forms, including criticism, interviews, personal essays, and reportage. And they will also read the work of authors ranging from all-time masters like George Orwell and Joan Didion, to more contemporary luminaries like Roxane Gay, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Sherman Alexie. By the end of the term, students will have not only gained a firm understanding of a branch of literature sometimes called the "art of fact," they will have also generated a substantial nonfiction portfolio of their own.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In somewhat antithetical ways, Bertolt Brecht (Germany, 1898-1956) and Dario Fo (Italy, b. 1926)undertook the task of transforming the modern theater into a platform for radical social and political change during the first and second halves, respectively, of the twentieth century. This course will offer an introduction to both the theories and major works of Brecht and Fo.  Works by Brecht will include the theoretical treatise A Little Organum for the Theater, and plays such as Mother Courage and Her Children, The Life of Galileo, The Three-Penny Opera, St. Joan of the Stockyards, and The Good Woman of Sezuan.  From Fo's work we will read Tricks of the Trade, which relates his theories of theatrical performance, and the plays Mistero Buffo, Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Can't Pay? Won't Pay!, and Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221. Register into the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the vast, variegated field of critical theory. We will study the concepts, questions, and debates that have been central to understandings of modern culture. In order to do so, we will explore key contributions in psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonial studies. As we explore this wide range of approaches, we will interrogate how thinkers have imagined and reimagined terms like "art," "reading," "subjectivity," "modern," "discipline," "culture," "power," "technology," "sovereignty" and "nature," among others. And as we build this critical lexicon, we will examine the social institutions and intellectual formations that shape each debate. What kinds of knowledge does critical theory produce, and what are their blindspots? What forms of personhood and community do these theories outline, and in whose interests? What kinds of insights become visible when we examine conflicting theories together? Thinkers include Adorno, Agamben, Althusser, Barthes, Benjamin, Benveniste, Bhabha, Butler, Chow, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Freud, Gramsci, Hall, Haraway, Irigaray, Jameson, Lacan, Latour, Levi-Strauss, Lukacs, Marx, Ranciere, Said, Saussure, Spivak, Terranova, Willliams, and others. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RHETORICS OF NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have not only shaped contemporary culture; they have also shaped how we talk about culture, as well as how we talk about bodies and communities. Is there progressive potential in the trend toward computerization? Or contrarily, in what ways might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This writing workshop will ask you to employ the tenets of transgender self-creation into textual production.  You will be spending 11 weeks with one particular book with the intent to create a "transgendered" version by identifying and imagining all the ways through which a body can be added to, subtracted from, and generally modified in service of an authentic self that has been embedded, misplaced, mourned, repressed, or otherwise dispossessed.  Such a project necessitates thinking about the book as flesh.  You will be asked to develop an intimacy with the book that will allow you to give it a different and differently true contours. &lt;br&lt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LAS OPEN SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The LAS Open Seminar is devoted to the development of undergraduate and graduate degree projects that engage the discipline of literary arts and studies, and involves the writing of a longer, research-based project (thesis, artist's statement, creative work, etc).   This engagement may take a variety of different forms, including a direct referencing or interaction with literary texts or issues; a focus on textuality and/or narrativity; a concern with research and the mechanics of writing a longer project.   Therefore, as the course title indicates, the seminar has an open structure to accommodate our ability to address and foster each student's interests and concerns.  As the semester progresses, we will move from a discussion of texts that introduce key concepts in the framing of interdisciplinary projects to group analyses and the workshopping of each student's project.  In the first part of the semester, we will discuss a number of conceptual tenets that will ground our theorization of the artistic process, including issues of intentionality and audience; issues of translation and interdisciplinarity; and the relation of form to content.  The second part of the semester will be organized and driven by group analyses of the degree and related written project of each class member. &lt;BR&gt;  (Note that the course is only open to Juniors, Seniors, 5th Years and Graduate Students.) &lt;I&gt;For permission to enroll in this course, please contact the instructor, Dr. Patricia Barbeito pbarbeit@risd.edu &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY VISIONARIES: D.H. LAWRENCE AND FLANNERY O'CONNOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will explore two controversial and influential writers who struggled to illuminate possibilities for reformation and redemption in the rapidly changing world of the early to mid twentieth century. The British D. H. Lawrence and the American Flannery O'Connor both held religious and philosophical views that informed their writing. Lawrence's lamentation for the separation of people from the earth and the decline of powerful patriarchal spiritual leaders in a corrupt materialistic culture underlies his investigation into human relationships in the Modernist era. O'Connor's Roman Catholicism-with its emphasis on the concept of redemptive grace-provides the backdrop for her exploration into the problematic civilization of the post-World War II era. Lawrence often focuses on the British working class while O'Connor centers on the idiosyncratic population of the American south. Studying these two writers side by side should reveal the fascinating ways in which seemingly diverse writers converge to enlighten readers. We will read texts such as Lawrence's &lt;i&gt;Sons and Lovers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Complete Collected Short Stories&lt;/i&gt; and O'Connor's &lt;i&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Other Stories&lt;/i&gt;. Students will keep journals, write two papers, and take mid-term and final exams.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IRISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Ireland has a long history of literature, stretching from pre-Christian epics through monastic manuscripts right up to the thriving contemporary scene. While there are many important Irish writers before the beginning of the twentieth century, clearly the birth of the Abbey theatre and the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the prose of James Joyce created reverberations still felt in Ireland today. Using Joyce, Synge, and Yeats as a beginning point, in this seminar we will look at a series of contemporary Irish writers whose work builds upon the foundation established in the early years of the twentieth century. One of the themes we will return to again and again in this course is the theme of loss - loss of language, loss of sovereignty, loss of loved ones.  What does Stephen mean when he says, "History is a Nightmare from which I am trying to awake"?  Why is Yeats left in "the foul rag and bone shop of the heart"?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a writer of historical fiction, I am drawn to set stories in the past for many reasons: fascination with another world or way of life, a desire to understand today's world through a study of the past, the desire to time-travel and experience another world through fiction. Students are invited to bring their passions and interests to the table in this course that will combine two disciplines, the study of history and the literary arts. Short works of historical fiction and discussions of craft specific to historical fiction will be read and discussed. Research techniques and resources will be examined. Students will produce one work of historical analysis that relies on the use of primary and secondary sources. The latter half of the semester will be focused on producing and workshopping fiction set in the past. The course assumes a familiarity with the writing of short fiction and the basic elements of craft. Previous courses in creative writing are preferred but not required; registration is by permission of the instructor and based on the submission of a creative writing sample.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above.

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: FAMILY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of Anna Karenina reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GREEN CULTURAL STUDIES FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Broadly defined, a green cultural studies approach asks questions about how the more-than-human other is produced and represented in texts. Furthermore, a green cultural studies approach seeks to explore the stakes and consequences of these productions and representations. In this seminar we will concentrate on discerning and analyzing discourses of nature present in films produced in North America in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Possible topics for consideration include: nature documentaries and other representations of the animal, the aesthetics of landscape cinematography, the symbolic role(s) of wilderness, the presence and consequences of environmental rhetoric, gendered encounters with the natural world, narratives of environmental apocalypse and/or toxicity, environmental justice, and cyborgs and other modified or transgenic organisms. To contextualize our primary texts in the films we will read articles on ecocritical theory and methodology, on film theory and philosophy, and on relevant environmental issues. Throughout the semester each student will do independent research. This research, shared with the class on a regular basis, will serve as the foundation for a final essay of at least twenty-five pages.  Open to sophomore and above</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: NOIR GOES GLOBAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Noir crime fiction and film have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity around the world: from Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling Millennium trilogy to the rise of Havana Noir.   Why this fascination with all things noir?  Like classic noir, these new crime fictions from around the world serve to "unleash demons..bottled up in the national psyche,"  but, more particularly, they do so at a time when the very notion of a national psyche is being redefined under the pressures of globalization.  Combining gritty realism, moral complexity and striking visual and literary styles, these texts adopt and parody some of the main conventions of classic noir crime traditions in order to comment on the effects of globalization and its neoliberal corporate underpinnings.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Professional actor/director Fred Sullivan (Trinity Repertory Company resident artist and RISD Acting Workshop instructor)  will guide a company of student actors, designers, stage managers, and construction crew through a workshop process of producing a live play for the stage, culminating in a weekend of public performances of the production. Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

We will discuss reasons why these works have a distinguished place in the American literary canon and consider whether or not they will be perceived as literary masterpieces in the new millennium.  If time permits, the class will meet the standards of literary excellence we develop during the course. Students will keep journals and write two papers, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation, located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. More specifically, this course offers RISD students the opportunity to visit a biological hotspot and consider its role in society; participate in conservation science field research; interact cross-culturally; and develop their communication skills. Taught collaboratively, this course emphasizes the importance of connecting ideas, information, and methodologies across the arts, humanities, and sciences, with an emphasis on biology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will spend the first week of the course at RISD, the next 3.5 weeks in Guyana and the last half week at RISD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take both LAEL-LE97 and LAS-E717. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits as identified by each subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration.

   <COURSEDESC>Since the early Hollywood years, films have played a major role in the way American mainstream culture inscribes queerness: the many and diverse queer communities, identities, and experiences. This course begins with an examination of earlier representations of queerness in Hollywood films, tracing queer cinematic images throughout the early 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  We will screen queer films such as Nazimova's &lt;i&gt; Salome (1922) &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; The Killing of Sister George (1968) &lt;/i&gt; to analyze their representations of queer identity and examine what they signify to us today.  Our examination of queer film will address the following questions: What is gay or lesbian film?  What is a queer film? What are the ways in which the discourses of race, gender, and sexuality are interrelated and deployed?  The latter half of the course also will examine selected films and documentaries from the new emerging queer cinema and a selection of film shorts that are currently running in queer film festivals.</COURSEDESC>

But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will provide students with a foundation in modern and contemporary North American poetry. We will explore poetry as a vehicle for self-expression, thought experiment, political transformation, and world-building, and as a thing in its own right. What do poetic forms have to do with the ways that communities, selves, rights, nation-states and worlds have been reimagined in the modern period? Schools and movements will include: Imagism, Objectivism, the Harlem Renaissance, the Confessionalists, the Black Mountain School, the Beats, the New York School, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, Conceptualism, Flarf, and experiments in New Media. We will also read from poets who seem to exceed easy categorization-Kathy Acker, Amiri Baraka, Sarah Blake, Cathy Park Hong, Susan Howe, Pamela Lu, Nathaniel Mackey, Fred Moten, Claudia Rankine, Lisa Robertson, Juliana Spahr and John Yau, among others. Rather than represent the range of practices that mark any historical moment, our goal throughout will be to trace particular lines, affiliations and antagonisms across moments within twentieth- and twenty-first century North American verse.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This 3-credit  Non-Major Studio (NMSE) is integrated with a mandatory/concurrent 3-credit Liberal Arts (LAS) component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A city of paradoxes or merely contradictions? American historian Thomas F. Madden describes Venice as "a city without land, an empire without borders."  French philosopher Régis Debray, on the other hand, calls it "a kind of Euro-Disney for snobs," whereas Italian novelist Italo Calvino treats it as a paradigmatic point of intersection between death and desire, and so the quintessence of every city on earth.  Venice's status as off-shore metropolis at the top of the Adriatic - a marshy haven from invading "barbarians" that has conquered, traded with and been dominated by its antagonists, including the sea over more than a millennium - makes it one of the most intriguing and atypical cities in Europe, if not the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take NMSE-0723-01.

In this class, we will examine how narratives of eco-disaster ask us to imagine the relationship between humans and their environment, and we will also investigate how historical disaster fictions have shaped contemporary depictions of environmental catastrophe.  What role do concerns of race, class, and gender play in the rhetoric of natural disasters?  We will consider both historical disaster narratives like Robert Barr's &lt;I&gt;The Doom of London&lt;/I&gt; and Richard Jefferies's &lt;I&gt;After London&lt;/I&gt;, as well as more contemporary fictions including Rachel Carson's &lt;I&gt;Silent Spring&lt;/I&gt;, Don Delillo's &lt;I&gt;White Noise&lt;/I&gt;, and the 2013 film &lt;I&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/I&gt;.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIVING WASTE LANDS: TRASH, ENERGY, AND SUSTAINABILITY IN FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In 1858, Edmund Dixon noted that even if you could "annihilate" all of Earth's garbage, sending it "off to the moon," the results would be disastrous, eventually leading to "utter sterility, famine, and the death of the human race."  For Dixon, trash was inescapable but necessary, simultaneously contaminating and valuable.  Waste underscores the limits of urban sustainability, and utopian visions of cities often depict an (almost) closed system, with a purpose for everything discarded and unused.  In this course, we will ask: How have writers and artists imagined the function of trash in society?  What can garbage tell us about a place?  How do the principles of thermodynamics shape the way that we think about waste?  In considering such questions, we will look at historical and contemporary works, including Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, Vivan Sundaram's Trash, and Lucy Walker's documentary Waste Land. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will provide an overview of the literature of South America from the mid-nineteenth century to the present. Focusing on literary texts from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, we will investigate how writers assimilated and modified the European literary tradition, creating works that, notwithstanding some of their "universal" themes, incorporate questions particular to South America. These questions include: can we speak of unity in the context of South America's various literary productions? How has European literature influenced South American writers, and how have they incorporated and challenged it? How do they address politics, questions of gender, race, and class? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this course we will take the legacy of The Arabian Nights as the foundation for our investigation of the ways that stories work on audiences-from stopping serial killers to calling attention to sexual violence.  We will investigate ways that 20th century artists including Salman Rushdie, Marc Chagall, A.S. Byatt, and Walt Disney have made use of this story in their own ways for their own persuasive ends. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Martin Scorsese offers an epilogue to an era in The Last Waltz (The Band, 1978). Madonna sells herself in Truth or Dare (1991) and Metallica undergoes group therapy in Some Kind of Monster (2004). Rock documentaries are as much about the social and political state of America as they are about music and musicians. In this course, we will explore the visual language and cultural history of the rockumentary film genre. Topics for discussion will include: documentary and cinema Veriti narrative forms; the troubled notion of documentary "truth"; music as commercial product; fandom and the cult of celebrity; and the rise of MTV. Students should be prepared to participate in class discussion, attend film screenings, complete critical readings, and hone their analytical writing skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores both the conflicted subject position of American Indians in popular culture as well as the manner in which American Indians inscribe their own subjectivity in films and literature. America Indians have been portrayed in a variety of different and often contradictory ways in American popular culture: from primtive savages to symbols of intuitive wisdom, from tragic figures that embody the loss of a culture and land, to hardy survivors. American Indian writers and filmmakers address these images in their current works.  This class will begin with a study of visual representations of Indians in paintings, photographs, popular cultural images, ethnographic films.  We will then focus on the novels and films made by prominent American Indians. Our inquiry will address Indian subjectivity and the manner in which American Indian writers inscribe the postmodern condition How do the experiences of this varied group of authors and filmmakers - all of whom are mixed-blood and vary in the degree of familiarity with their native culture-- interrogate existing stereotypes and beliefs about native peoples?  Further topics of discussion will include: the inclusion of trickster strategies and Indian humor;the relationship of narrative strategies  to oral traditions; the different community experiences of American Indians; and the construction and deconstruction of the self in novels/films. Finally, we will also attempt to formulate our own definition of what encompasses American Indian literature as well as its placement within the American literary canon.</COURSEDESC>

The term usually implies a system of interrelated cultural and natural forces operating within a context of a defined scale or disciplinary boundaries.  In this course we examine and discuss the foundational definitions of the term landscape and the theoretical stances that are active in the creation of contemporary landscape architecture, land art and other creative disciplines. Writing assignments will be based upon fundamental texts, direct experience, and contemporary projects. Weekly readings will be discussed and diagrammed in class for content and structure. Students will produce a series of  five short (2 to 3 page) analytical essays and case studies. There will be weekly discussion sections with course TAs to review readings, two field assignments, and one field trip to the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to qualified undergraduates and non-majors by instructor permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops the different levels of dexterity and control in the construction of architectural drawing. The pedagogy allows for students to build a basic understanding of orthographic drawing typologies and traditional drawing methods while preparing them for more complex hybridized drawing methods. A parallel segment of the course addresses freehand representation, developing observation and translation tools necessary to design. Through these multiple approaches, drawing is developed as a tool to transform conceptual ideas into tangible form. The class will be taught as a series of lectures that discuss both why and how we draw accompanied by skill building workshops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Autodesk 3ds Max Design program will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00  &lt;i&gt;Elective; LDAR majors only, Open to ARCH + INTAR by permission of instructor&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do these words mean and what is their relationship to each other in the architectural design disciplines? Each word is packed with complex and evolving meanings that reflect the state of human knowledge about the environments in which we live and in which we intervene. Each word reflects our understanding of systems, physical, cultural and social, biotic and abiotic, as well as our aspirations to conserve, restore, or reshape those systems. Each word is ubiquitous in the contemporary quest to construct a sustainable, resilient future.  But do we really understand what they mean? Are they critically interdependent or can they be considered separately?&lt;br&gt; This studio will examine these questions with the twin objectives of establishing an evolving and dynamic understanding of the terms and generating working methods that respond to the complexities of scale encountered in the landscape. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This final core studio stresses large-scale design and planning issues, complex sites, and urban conditions. The city is a living organism which evolves in a particular locale with a particular form due to a combination of environmental and cultural factors. These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux.

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since it's creation over 100 years ago, landscape architecture has expanded beyond horticultural preoccupations to a discipline that engages natural, political and cultural systems to build ecological and social resilience.  This professional practice seminar explores contemporary practices of landscape architecture through the exploration of six current trends in practice: operating, researching, engaging, constructing, programming, and sustaining.  These topics are explored and discussed through student research initiatives, in-class lectures, readings, case study presentations from a wide range of practitioners, office visits, and site visits.  The goal of the course is to expose students to the variety of ways to practice landscape architecture today.  Students are encouraged to ask questions, bring their own experiences to class, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.  &lt;br&gt; Please see 2014 class blog for student content and writing samples: http://principlesofpractice2014.tumblr.com&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing.&lt;BR&gt; An essential ingredient in the course involves the Medium. While we will discuss "medium" as it relates to the "message" (MacLuhan), we will also medium within themes of workflow production and the experimentation process, and the conveyance of the artists' intent. Another essential ingredient is Process, (or evidence of a process). This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. Lastly, Corroboration as a separate theme will highlight the expected mutual reinforcement that takes place between visceral representation and quantitative infographic overlays.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Major Elective;Open to ARCH and LDAR majors; Open to others by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH METHODS FOR DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar introduces a spectrum of research methodologies meaningful to design disciplines focusing on the intersection of the human, built and natural worlds - approaches stemming for the social sciences, environmental sciences, and design practice.  Students will work through a variety of written and visual means to explore differences between, and uses of, quantitative and qualitative data collection, analysis, interpretation, and application.  Methods to be explored include Grounded Theory, Phenomenological Inquiry, Participatory approaches, Ethnography, Comparative approaches, Case Study, Postmodern Critical Theory, Systems Theory, survey, narrative, typologies, experimentation, modeling, matrices, mapping, design as research, and social and environmental impact assessment and evaluation.  Special attention will be paid to issues of causality, generalization, values and ethics.  &lt;BR&gt;  The class will be organized around a set of related issues water, ground and poverty, with a focus on the city of Providence.  There will be two phases of research with the class participants determining the over-riding research question. Each phase will involve teamwork where teams will utilize different research methodologies to examine the same basic question, and will include written and visual documentation, analysis and interpretation.  At the end of each phase, students will explore the differences between the various methodologies and their outcomes and discuss when and how certain approaches and their combination may be more or less effective as part of the practice, critique and scholarship of design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This graduate seminar meets two days a week, three hours each.  It is required for all first-year students in Landscape Architecture. &lt;BR&gt; Open to Graduate Level only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEB ECOLAB</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Increasingly, consumers are not only interested in the fad of "green building" strategies, but are more and more conscious of their part in stewardship of their natural environment and its connections to the greater whole. As designers of the built environment, it is up to us to help bring the conversation to the table and spearhead the research and experiments that will propel our environmental stewardship forward and inspire others. As a whole, we are becoming more educated and aware of the ecologies surrounding us and the dialogue between these elements in relationship. This course is an exploration of how we can bring these relationships to the surface and experiment to assist their natural functions through what we design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   A 2009 New York Times article, "Some buildings not living up to green label", documented considerable problem of nominal ecological buildings. Many landlords and businessmen just use LEED certification as their promotional tools. Virtually, most LEED buildings were well considered enough to pass the standards for being certified without thinking real value of ecological designs. One of the dominant problem for green buildings programs is treating buildings in isolation from their urban contexts. Architecture by itself can be a solution for ecological design when only considering inside of the building. However, it would have enormous effect when they communicate with the urban contexts and forces such as wind, sunlight, humidity, and hydrology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course will focus on a reassessment of the built world on environmentally conscious terms. We will rethink the lens in which we see buildings and inhabitable spaces to better serve the natural environment through stewardship. This will range from facade treatment of structures to a systematic approach to urban design in experimental projects. Digital modeling programs such as Ecotect and Autodesk Plug-ins will allow us to test our projects with real world parameters, and physical models will speak to the function of hydrological and mechanical systems and operations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   No matter your program of study, this course will be a laboratory in which you may experiment and study sustainable infrastructures in mediums of your choice. Between case studies, precedent presentations, and small design charrettes, we will explore how to improve your designs within the larger context of the natural environment.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HUMAN BODY IN A LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a short course designed to compliment students' representation of the ongoing or finished projects, designed to help students to better understand and learn how to apply human body scale to their practice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   Why is this important? Throughout the history of human civilizations people were capable of building environment suitable for living long before they invented mathematics, geometry and universal measurement system. Architecture and landscape have always been in a close connection and relation to a human body - and a human body has been one of the most interesting subjects of study in Western culture.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;bR&gt;   It is impossible to imagine a space without relating it to the human body. In the beginning of LDAR program at RISD all students take measurements of their bodies and then use them to measure heights, lengths, widths of streets, buildings, landscapes. They intuitively understand strong relation of a body to a landscape, because human beings perceive their surroundings from their eye level, from their own height, therefore, architects design from the same point of view. However, when it comes to representation, students often forget about this relationship. Not only drawing a figure in a section enhances its artistic value, not only it makes it clearer to readers of the draft, but it also helps the designers themselves to feel how the space works, to predict how it would work for one, two, twenty people at the site.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This class is specifically geared towards students who want to learn to analyze scale and be able to use drawn human figure in their everyday practice. Students who have little background in technical, artistic, traditional or digital drawing or who wish to expand these skills will benefit from this class. The first half of the course will be dedicated to studying of basics of human ergonomics and its elementary application to students' work. Practical assignments will help students to analyze and realize the scale of their environment just by observing it. In the second half of the course, after gaining experience in drawing and scaling human figures in multiple techniques students will be able to apply gained knowledge and skills to a studio project or to future portfolio pieces.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $70.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PORTABLE LANDSCAPES: A 21ST CENTURY PATTERN BOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Pattern Book historically represents the value structure of its author. Alternately a polemic, a catalog, or a system, it is at once both cultural commentary and navigation toolkit. In a digital age, traditional print forms of the pattern book may open up or give way to digital dissemination --through website, blog, Instagram, or other modes. The intention of the pattern book is typically to make ideas more accessible to a wider audience. This has never been more possible than today.  But to whom is our work intended to speak? How? And why? What are the implications of the form moving forward, whether rooted in a traditional mode or reinvented? How can the pattern book be deployed in a way that asks us to, or demands that we, reinvent ourselves? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The authors' choices and representations offer specific critique within a contemporary landscape, while providing an attitude and direction that has the potential to shape future contexts. Students are asked first to understand, through research, the historical modus operandi of their selected model. This is followed by each individual's definition of their own intended working space, within the broader framework of the pattern book as a working structure. The process is completed with a new pattern book, populated with seed examples of art or design in their set mode, tailored to a specific target audience, which could form the basis for future explorations. The final project will combine the acts of art, design, commentary, and storytelling in proportion to the author's intended message.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This course operates primarily as a seminar, but will incorporate studio work in the final project to a degree in accordance with the students stated intention. Students will each create a pattern book that stands on its own, but we will also investigate the possibility of viewing the collected student works as they form a larger whole.&lt;BR&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR HONORS INTERDISCIPLINARY CRITIQUE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course in which first-semester seniors who have already demonstrated unusual commitment, ambition and initiative within their majors will pursue and discuss independent work in a setting that reflects, as closely as possible, the interdisciplinary conversation that actually takes place around advanced art practice today. The course is intended to allow those working within medium-specific vocabularies to test how their work will make meaning in an art world in which a variety of disciplinary histories and conventions coexist, clash, and inform one another, as well as to provide an opportunity for students whose work bridges two or more disciplines (or involves performance/new genres/post-studio approaches) to learn from one another and from faculty capable of addressing all of these sorts of practices. This is a demanding critique course with additional seminar components (readings, screenings, discussions, slide presentations, etc.), and as such students can expect a workload equivalent to a core studio requirement within their major.&lt;br&gt;  Acceptance into the course will be based on a GPA of 3.25 or greater as well as the recommendation of faculty and department heads from the student's major and on review of previous work. Candidates will be identified in discussions between the instructor and department heads during the preceding spring semester. Successful completion of ARTH-H490/PAINT-4507 (Contemporary Art &amp; its Discourses) or equivalent coursework is a prerequisite, ensuring students have a shared understanding of the art historical context for interdisciplinary. The maximum enrollment is limited to seminar-size (c. 15 students) in order to provide sufficient attention to each student's work in group and individual critiques while still allowing for seminar-style discussions Instructor permission required.</COURSEDESC>

Students will be exposed to a wide range of viewpoints and discourse on contemporary art issues as defined by the interests of three different, practicing critics. Each critic will become part of the RISD community for approximately one month, conducting 3 sessions on campus and one in New York or Boston. On-campus meetings will consist of lectures, reading and writing assignments, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits. Off-campus trips will include visits to museums, galleries and artist studios. Small groups of students will be expected to lead several classes.

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at two phenomena, the academy and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices from the 1990s to the present.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide array of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting -- but not its most traditional conventions.  With a deep engagement in process and informed by readings and targeted artists and art historical movements, students will explore materiality and visual culture. Shopping for "art supplies" will take place as much at Home Depot as at Utrecht. Employing the recycled and trash, the found and gathered, and the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning.  From duct tape to cotton balls soaked in acrylic paint -- one finds context, from varying thicknesses of rope dipped in polymer mediums to woven plastic shopping bags -- one finds structure, and from paint squirted from plastic ketchup bottles to fake fur -- one finds attitude.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course open to all majors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLOR STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio-based course will provide the foundation necessary to understand basic color theory and practice in painting, art, and design. An historical and cultural perspective will be introduced to inform ongoing color studies executed in the studio. Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Open to all majors&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will examine a series of canonical readings of contemporary art, focusing primarily on key writings published in the journal October and the magazine Artforum since 1975. We will engage in detail with such overarching critical concepts as postmodernism, neo-avant-garde, site-specificity, and relational aesthetics. We will also examine readings that draw on concepts such as the fetish, the abject, the informe, the gaze, primitivism, and postcolonialism.

The goal is not only to introduce and familiarize, but also to collectively and actively generate possibilities for and within the medium. Six overlapping nodes, or case studies, each accompanied by readings and a list of relevant artists, guide our investigation: Endings and Beginnings, Monochromania, Photoshop Killed the Photographer Killed the Painter, Market Mechanisms (and Academic Exercises), Regional Painting, and Narrative. When possible, current exhibitions will be discussed.  The course will be seminar style sessions interspersed with critique and discussion of the work of enrolled students.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective, Painting seniors only&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt;Elective; Senior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLAGE BARRAGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Photoshop to CGI, hip-hop samples to pop-up ads, collage has become a ubiquitous force in our lives. Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque coined the term 'collage' in the early 20th century to describe their experiments in reconfiguring the detritus of everyday life. Surrealists, Pop Artists and political radicals alike have since embraced the technique as a way to reorder the material world. Now, collage is our de-facto mode of presenting verbal and visual information,so omnipresent as to be practically invisible. This course will give the technique its due, examining its historical roots and touching upon the aesthetic influence of collage in literature,film, music and dance. We will move through modes of image making: collaging with cut paper, experimenting with color, utilizing unorthodox materials and engaging in collaboration. Students will develop their own sensibilities and goals within this open-ended technique. Get ready to cut up and reassemble anything you can get your hands on! Let's re-radicalize this age-old process.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as in direct processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques.

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be designed to develop confidence and experience with paint and painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques. No prior painting experience is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STRATEGIES FOR PERSONAL NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As visual artists, we each have different experiences and life events unique to our own circumstances, yet we wish to communicate them to a broader audience - even a universal one. How can one effectively do this? How can we use our own personal histories as a generative machine for art making? In this course we will consider the various ways in which students can communicate the intricacies of personal narratives through the visual languages of drawing and painting. This class will closely examine the relationship of these mediums to film, with its capacity to synthesize narratives and visual images. Weekly screenings will supplement readings, writing exercises, museum visits, in class slide lectures, assignments and individual meetings. Students will pursue themes of time, memory, intimacy, myth, and perspective, all as a means of communicating their individual experiences through the practices of drawing and painting. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACTION: THEN AND NOW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> What did it mean to make a black square painting in 1915? What does it mean to make the same painting today? Abstraction, once thought to be and exhausted language, has experienced a profound resurgence in contemporary art making. This studio-seminar course examines the rich history of abstraction through exploring stylistic and thematic concerns of key movements in abstract art. Studio production is balanced with generative readings, discussions, and lectures to create a space where art making and critical thinking work hand-in-hand to deepen our grasp of the material. We will work on paper, vellum and canvas; utilizing a variety of media including graphite, charcoal, collage material, gouache, and acrylic paint.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   This course presents a historically rooted introduction to contemporary abstraction that begins in the 1950s and continues through the present day. Rather than a strictly chronological survey, we'll examine specific moments, shifting political trends, popular culture, and theoretical frameworks that continue to inform contemporary practice and criticism. We'll begin by identifying key figures within well established Modern and Postmodern art movements, paying special attention to shifting relationships between form and content in our studio assignments to develop and expand our visual vocabulary. We'll then proceed by looking at artistic practices and curatorial attempts that sought to reroute the linear trajectories of late modernism. We'll draw on these practices that critique conventional notions of artistic categories and deconstruct the distinction between center and periphery as models for expanding the possibilities for abstraction in contemporary art today.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>APROPRIATION: STRATEGIES FOR BORROWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Painting has a rich history of borrowing, described as anything from homage to translation, pastiche to influence, imitation to laziness. But how does one classify a reference as an act of translation rather than as an act of theft? What are the implications of utilizing a Matisse color palette or incorporating a pair of Mickey Mouse hands? And what constitutes an ethical borrowing practice when nearly every painting is available to copy and paste? The objective of this class is to incorporate strategies for the appropriation of paintings and drawings through painting and drawing. As a class, we will explore how historical and contemporary modes of appropriation can be utilized through studio-based assignments and discuss the implications and potentials of these methods in a contemporary context. Through studio work, lectures, readings, and class discussion, we will develop a multifaceted definition of appropriation: as gesture, as method, and as tradition. In order to establish the historical lineage and contemporary framework of appropriation, we will study the practices of Pablo Picasso, Robert Rauschenberg, Raymond Pettibon, Richard Prince, Sarah Morris, and Nijideka Akunyjli Crosby, amongst others. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLOR AND LIGHT: VISION, THEORY, AND PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio-based painting course will explore color and light from a number of different perspectives (traditional color theory, scientific/biological, and metaphorical/symbolic), with an overall focus on applying these concepts to your own art practice. The emphasis of the course will be on developing the tools to make thoughtful and deliberate color choices in your work, while also gaining an understanding of the scientific basis of various color and light phenomena. Lecture topics will include: fundamentals of color theory, basic color mixing, the science of color and vision, the science behind various optical effects, connecting vision and art, the psychology of color, and the symbolic role of color. Painting assignments will focus on exploring and applying the concepts covered in the lectures. While the painting assignments will focus on specific color theory topics, they will be flexible enough to allow students to explore whatever ideas and subject-matters interest them. Short group critiques will accompany each painting project. Painting assignments may be performed in any media (though oil, acrylic or gouache are strongly recommended). Short reading assignments will also accompany this course, as well as a field trip to the RISD Museum.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OFF THE CUFF, OFF THE WALL: ADAPTIVE STUDIO PRACTICES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class is aimed at students wishing to get their toes wet with snappy material and conceptual strategies for making work. Early on, students will choose one of four themes (biographical, fictional narrative, 21st century social political issue, appropriation within the history of art) and settle on a single idea, concept or story for working fast and loose through different mediums. Students will acquire practical skills such as mold making, casting in cement and plaster, image transfers, prepping surfaces for mixed media, and basic mono-print techniques. As the course progresses, the product of each assignment becomes the building block for the next, prioritizing process over finished work. Students will move from 2-D into 3-D ways of making, subjecting their ideas to material prompt offering "quick and dirty" approaches. Drawing, collage, object making, video, performative gesture, and installation will all be used over the course of this class. For their final projects, students will be encouraged to synthesize the various practical skills acquired during the course. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The class will include visits to the Visual + Material Resource Center, slide presentations, demonstrations, in-class experimentation, critiques and individual meetings.&lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

This course follows Issues &amp; Image I and introduces students to a wide range of critical issues and expressive approaches in time-based (lens-based) work, concentrating on work of the past two decades. Course time will be divided among multimedia lectures, group discussions, visiting artists/curators, in-class projects, and student presentations. Reading and writing assignments will introduce students to the concepts and language of time-based work. Class lectures will expose them to a large range of styles, methods, genres and content concerns. Practical assignments (including a collaboratively-produced videotape, individually edited and presented to the class) will allow students to put theory into practice and understand in a low-tech, hands-on way the expressive possibilities of time-based work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; Registration by Photography department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to give junior majors a thorough and deep understanding of the intermediate-level workflow for film capture and scanning and digital camera RAW file capture. Both workflows allow students to produce the highest quality inkjet prints on large-format printers. This course will touch on many topics, including advanced tonal and color correction techniques, image sharpening, digital camera exposure and Raw file processing, inkjet and Lightjet printing and automated batch file processing. While this course is primarily technical, students are expected to pursue their ongoing personal work to fulfill assignments, culminating in a final portfolio of 10 finished digital prints that demonstrate mastery of the techniques learned in the course. Students entering the course should be proficient in the use of the Macintosh platform and basic Photoshop operations and have a good understanding of processing and printing in black and white photography. Transfer majors must demonstrate these proficiencies to the satisfaction of the department before being permitted to enroll in this course.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; May be taken concurrently with PHOTO 5212&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor for nonmajors&lt;br&gt; Fee for nonmajors $100.00  Deposit $100.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STILL:MOVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This final course in the required technical series for majors emphasizes the potentials of image-making untethered from a paper support. With the advent of digital image capture, the photograph, as digital data, has become an infinitely malleable unit of meaning that can be reconstituted to form sequences and transformations. Not only can it be a still print-object, but it can be a projection of light on any number of surfaces, an informational component in a screen-based narrative, or one visual element among many in an environmental installation. Students will explore the dynamic intersections between moving and still; timeless and time-driven; simultaneous and sequential imaging. They will learn how to move data fluidly among different programs and to work from a broader "systems-level" perspective - a necessity in the context of today's rapidly changing software platforms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; May be taken concurrently with PHOTO 5311&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor for nonmajors&lt;br&gt; Fee for nonmajors $100.00  Deposit: $100.00&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM INSTAMATIC TO INSTAGRAM: PHOTOGRAPHIC PRACTICES IN THE DIGITAL AGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The practice of taking pictures with a camera phone is so much more widespread than any other form of image-making in the history of humankind." - Mia Fineman, Associate Photography Curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY.&lt;BR&gt; Who is a photographer and who is the audience for photographic images today? How has the Internet changed conditions for taking, viewing, and sharing images? Increasingly, photographic images inhabit a virtual slipstream that dislodges pictures from both their object status and original author and context. The internet shifts, blurs, and multiplies the relationships between images.&lt;BR&gt; How are artists responding? In this class, you will engage in critical analysis of contemporary photographic practices in a networked age, and also define your own practice of collecting and organizing the images you upload to (or take from) the web.&lt;BR&gt; You will be developing different methodologies for presenting your "curated" collections including (but not limited to), book, tumblr, installation, YouTube, or blog formats. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making.  We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)  Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Deposit:$100&lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course fee and department receiving fee:$100.00 &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGE BANK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Image Bank is an interdisciplinary course investigating how new personal, social and political meanings can be generated from disparate visual sources. Sifting through the sedimentary layers of our experience of visual images (from high to mundane), each student will create a personalized image bank of at least 250 examples, including snapshots, postcards, newspaper and magazine clippings, internet images and their own photographs. What once seemed series of casually accumulated images becomes something concrete and intentional. Students will each create personal "rules" for  their collecting, yet be challenged to explore how meanings change as they follow or bend those rules. Through collecting, indexing, and juxtaposing images, students will hone their skills as image interpreters and create new personal visual languages for themselves. In the end, each student will have a physical or digitized image bank to be used as source material for future projects. Throughout the course, we will explore artists whose work has focused on image collecting, including Gerhard Richter, Douglas Blau, Buzz Spector, John Cage, Martha Rossler, August Sander, Nina Katchadourian, John Baldessari, Hanne Darboven and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fee for non-majors: $35.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)

   <COURSEDESC>This final course in the required technical series for majors emphasizes the potentials of image-making untethered from a paper support. With the advent of digital image capture, the photograph, as digital data, has become an infinitely malleable unit of meaning that can be reconstituted to form sequences and transformations. Not only can it be a still print-object, but it can be a projection of light on any number of surfaces, an informational component in a screen-based narrative, or one visual element among many in an environmental installation. Students will explore the dynamic intersections between moving and still; timeless and time-driven; simultaneous and sequential imaging. They will learn how to move data fluidly among different programs and to work from a broader "systems-level" perspective - a necessity in the context of today's rapidly changing software platforms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; May be taken concurrently with PHOTO 5311&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor for nonmajors&lt;br&gt; Fee for nonmajors $100.00  Deposit: $100.00&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

Ultimately, we will work together to gain a solid foundation in this media that can transfer into and augment the individual's own departmental work.&lt;BR&gt; Decision and problem solving en route to a final piece is key in making books. The class will discuss the positives and negatives of choosing materials and the structural layout of a book, The importance of becoming familiar with adhesives, tools and potential problems in the process will be stressed.&lt;BR&gt; Aspects of adhesive and non adhesive bindings as well as traditional and non traditional books will be covered in ways to enable each student to determine where their strengths and desires lay. It also will create work that will convey the contents narrative into a complete idea. This should not only leave each person with an enthusiasm for the book form as art, but the ability and confidence to produce books on their own.  Assignments will be given each week with the objective of manifesting that week's demonstration and objectives into a realized binding.

   <COURSEDESC>Printmaking's inclusive nature allows for many different approaches and opportunities. Motivated by historic, sociological, political and media driven revolutions, printmaking has undergone significant shifts throughout history.  The current world of image proliferation and rapid technological innovations have pushed the traditional boundaries of printmaking even further in the contemporary art world.  Many of today's artists are creating large-scale installations utilizing the printed multiple in many distinctive ways.

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO SCREENPRINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will learn Screenprinting (also known as Silkscreen and Serigraphy) from start to finish. Beginning with stretching their own screens, we will explore the many processes of the medium: Cut paper stencils and pochoir, photographic methods, hand drawing/painting, monoprinting, and multi-color printing. This fast-paced method is used in fine art printing as well as industry printing. With so many possibilities, students will be expected to propose and complete a final project employing these techniques. This course will encourage students to step out of their comfort zones. Incorporation of non-studio topics and non-printmaking techniques is encouraged.  Weekly critiques will provide opportunity to discuss the successes and failures, as well as to problem solve as a group. Through crits we will discuss the content and incorporation of individual topics with the images. Studio instruction will be supplemented with an instructor led museum visit. Students will learn studio etiquette and proper practices in a shared work studio&lt;BR&gt; Estimated cost of materials: $125.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCREENPRINTING: MATERIAL INVESTIGATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From beer bottles to baseball bats, T-shirts to posters, circuit boards to skateboards, screen printing is everywhere in both art and industry. As artists how do we tap into this permeable quality? The ability to print with a wide variety of materials onto a nearly endless range of substrates is a unique feature of the screen printing method. This fertile ground is worthy of deep investigation, both formally and conceptually. We will work with a multitude of materials through demonstrations and hands-on projects such as glass, metal, wood and solvent-based inks. Methods such as dry, faux-flocked, and direct printing will be covered. The class focus is to introduce students to physical attributes of screen printing while creating critical dialogues surrounding the why of material choices. Experimentation and play will be encouraged. Can material choices strengthen the content of a print? How can we utilize material as metaphor while avoiding the pitfalls of cliché? Can innovative screen printing technologies be implemented in intelligent ways that reach beyond spectacle? Rapid, yet malleable, weekly assignments during the first half of the term will introduce potential working methodology and will lead to a final, personalized exploratory project. Experimentation, creative problem solving and play will be encouraged. Slide presentations and pertinent readings will facilitate group contextual discussions with response papers, brainstorming lists and diagrams. Students will leave with four assigned prints and a final project.  Screen printing experience and a propensity and curiosity for responsible material use will be helpful. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S BOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This introductory class will allow students to work, examine and learn traditional and experimental forms of bookmaking. Students will gain knowledge of the various book forms, from the simple folded form to more complex book binding methods, pacing, and the various functions of the book. Students will discover the power and potential of the book form to dissipate, present and communicate through the use of imagery, text, materiality and form. This class will be an opportunity for students to explore the book form to its limit by taking a variety of approaches: form and shape, binding style, materials, content, and scale. These explorations will ultimately lead to a final project of their own, where students will be able to demonstrate their bookmaking skills, creativity and use of narrative.  The class will primarily focus on the exploration of contemporary book artists and their use of various binding methods. With visits to the Fleet Library Special Collections, the Minskoff Center for Prints, Drawings and Photographs in the RISD Museum and Brown's John Hay Library Special Collections students will have the opportunity to observe and explore the different techniques in which contemporary book artists have worked. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  At the end of this course students will leave with a deeper understating of the book form, its purpose to project and deliver information to the reader and a strong set of binding skills.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to build upon the fundamental principles of mold making and casting while exploring more complex concepts,  materials, and techniques. The transformative process of casting can embody the signs of growth or decay, of evolution and metamorphosis.  From cellular multiplicity to large scale sculptures, casting skills enable the artist to control the sensation of the finished work through a spectrum of materials and processes. &lt;BR&gt; Through demonstrations then hands-on exploration, students will pursue individual projects that reflect upon themes in sculpture that utilize casting for its unique versatility. Students will have extensive exposure to a variety of traditional and nontraditional materials. Processes will include multi-part shell molds, gypsum and composite materials for shell construction, urethane and silicone rubber, castable plastics, cold cast metals, and material specific release agents. We will review the possible health hazards associated with casting, and learn safe working methods, as well as have in-class discussions about concept and craft, various fabrication and finishing methods, and uses for molds in the making sculpture. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Our eyes are nearly always drawn towards something moving over something inert. What innovative strategies can be employed to incorporate video, sculpture, and physical space into a single work, without one medium dominating the other? How can an artist resolve the fundamental differences between two-dimensional moving images and three-dimensional objects or space? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of assimilating video, photography, sound, performance, objects, and space through studying and constructing multimedia sculpture and installations. Throughout the semester we will be presented with assignments that examine these different possibilities from multiple perspectives, including studio projects that deploy video in a sculptural context, and sculpture that is only activated through a video work. We will study the recent history of artists and designers who engage multimedia techniques and experiment with new formats and technologies. Students will learn the basics of DSLR camera technique, digital video editing, audio production, audio/video display technology, and installation techniques. Students in the course should have an understanding of sculptural materials and fabrication techniques, and should be ready to experiment with the fundamental structure of the presentation of media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Critical Issues Seminar 2 introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for thinking and writing about contemporary sculpture practice. Each seminar develops from a specific theme drawing on research from Grad Critical Issues 1, current debates in the field and contemporary events. Past seminars include: Artificial Natures, Precarious Relations, Frankenstein and Crime, Vanishing Points, as examples. Trespassing across sculpture, performance, cinema, fiction, feminist, queer, race and political theory and back again, we will address writings by Walter Benjamin, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Jacques Rancière (as examples) in conversation with contemporary artists writings and projects to cultivate a conceptual grammar to extend to our studio practice. Approaching issues in contemporary sculpture through these discursive perspectives generates new strategies simultaneously material, conceptual, and critical.  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Sculpture majors only&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will discuss, experiment and challenge the notion of metal as traditional industrial workhorse, or as coveted art object and embrace or reject these ideas as we create with this medium. Students will be encouraged to pursue other nontraditional uses of metal, through scavenging, collecting, transforming metal from various states into new surfaces and forms. With safety and ingenuity we will put into practice work of the hand and machine, use computer driven techniques in tandem with the deliberate and accidental to experiment with pattern, surface, line, form and color. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor. &lt;br&gt;Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Readings, slide presentations and discussion will examine artists and exhibitions that address site as context and content. The interdisciplinary structure encourages a dynamic exchange of ideas, methods and expertise that can serve to expand parameters of discipline based studio practice. Proposal research can be directed toward independent or collaborative projects. Students will implement site-based installations on the grounds of Fort Adams, culminating in a public exhibition with student led tours.

   <COURSEDESC>We will explore metal by cutting, machining, bending, warping,welding, stitching, binding, and altering the materials to pushand expand students skills and understanding of metal as material for sculpture. We will discuss, experiment and challenge the notion of metal as traditional industrial workhorse, or as coveted art object and embrace or reject these ideas as we create with this medium. Students will be encouraged to pursue other nontraditional uses of metal, through scavenging, collecting, transforming metal from various states into new surfaces and forms. With safety and ingenuity we will put into practice work of the hand and machine, use computer driven techniques in tandem with the deliberate and accidental to experiment with pattern, surface, line, form and color. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor. &lt;br&gt;Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class is a hands-on studio elective that explores the potential of fabric as a sculpture material.  We will spend the semester looking at useful examples of how fabrics have been utilized in a broad range of engineered solutions. Fabrics can be flexible, transparent, impermeable, delicate, rigid, lightweight, and stronger than steel. How has fabric been used to represent other materials in art? We will explore how fabric is being used in architecture, advertising, fashion, and design. We will consider the diverse functionality of all kinds of fabric and plastic materials and explore how these materials are engineered for specific purposes. We will study inflatable fabric structures as they have been engineered for art, architecture, advertising and functional objects. Students will build their own projects after learning the basics of patternmaking, assembly, and surface manipulation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Class will be held at a Brown University location, John Street Studios, per special arrangement. &lt;br&gt;Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore digital design and fabrication within the context of contemporary art, design, and architecture. Through a series of technical demonstrations, students will make connections between CAD/CAM software, digital fabrication technologies and the physical world. Students will become familiar with digital fabrication as it relates to traditional sculptural processes such as mold making/casting, metalworking and woodworking.&lt;BR&gt; Students will undertake a series of projects exploring 3D model creation using various CAD applications, 3D scanning technologies, and experimental approaches to digital model generation. Simultaneously, digital models will be made physical through additive and subtractive fabrication technologies including 3D printing, CNC milling, and laser cutting. The course will culminate with an ambitious final project encouraging students to blend digital fabrication technologies with their existing studio practice and/or research interest. The class will use Rhino3d as the primary CAD tool and students will need their own laptop with Rhino installed. The Mac version of Rhino is currently a free download and the Windows version is available at student pricing through rhino3d.com. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Elective, nonmajors by permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERFORMATIVE DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is Performative Drawing? Akin to dance, drawing just might be the next human activity that engages a spontaneous simultaneous interplay of thought, action and acting upon. This workshop will make inroads into answering the question by making works that address how we image the body in time and space with tools and media.&lt;BR&gt;   One of the genuine albeit complex truths about the act of drawing lies within the root word. You can draw straws, draw a breath, draw nearer, draw water, draw cards, draw a crowd, draw out, draw down, draw upon, draw a blank, draw a bead, draw attention. You can also draw a line. In doing so you are drawing upon a vast constellation of your resources. Impulse, desire, vision, philosophical thought, emotion, concept, motor skills large and small. These on board fuels are at once focused, then invested into a simple tool leaving traces on a surface in time and space. How an idea, concept, or emotion makes it's way to shape and form is right here in the triad of mind, hand and tool.  You may draw a beautifully imagined thought but it s the the hand in motion and the practice of training the hand to guide the tools that make simple lines transmit these sensations through time and space to an audience.&lt;BR&gt;   In this studio we will be working together and individually to explore how drawing is might to your studio practice. Drawing as a practice has often been somewhat mistakenly viewed as a preparatory or even secondary element within traditional studio practices like painting, sculpture and printmaking. Today in an expanded field, those outmoded viewpoints only stand to unfairly discriminate and rank modes of realizing concept and form. It is also true that this archaic view of drawing has origins in the humble materials often associated within the practice, such as charcoal, graphite and chalk and carbon black (ink), geological elements all. The substrates being skin and fiber. In a contemporary studio practice it is the artist's prerogative to either work with or challenge historical presets. The role of drawing in a contemporary studio practice may play multiple roles. Together we will look at, practice and explore that very thing trough installations, group projects and large scale immersive work.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERSECTING DIMENSIONS: WHERE PHOTOGRAPHY AND SCULPTURE MEET</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will challenge the mediums of photography and sculpture through an expanded view of how both image and form are defined and created. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, we will interrogate the innate similarities in both mediums as well as their differences to find the intersections of a new dimensionality. Already, these modes intrinsically engage in explorations of interpretation, representation, and spatial relationships. Further, how can sculpture, as photography does, harness light and image as a material? And how can photography, in turn, become visceral in its materiality? Through demonstrations and assignments we will learn and utilize tools from both disciplines such as basic digital camera capabilities, Adobe Photoshop, digital printing methods, conventional and digital fabrication methods, and experimental techniques. Students will then be encouraged to build upon these skills by incorporating elements of an existing or developing studio practice. We will look to artists whose work ranges from the more sculptural to the more photographic such as Letha Wilson, Rachel De Joode, Kate Steciw, Sara Van der Beek, John Houck, Thomas Demand, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Gregory Crewdson, Erwin Wurm, James Turrell, and more. This course will not rely strictly on the traditional methods, but rather students will be encouraged to experiment through an interdisciplinary mode of working. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the methods in which constraints (i.e.time, money, skills, identity, physical space, material, tools) impact the development and production of an artistic idea.  By generating our own additional sets of constraints from personal interest, we will investigate the ways that rules can be an inspiring force rather than a limiting one. Through strictly defined assignments, students gain experience for finding simple solutions for fabricating repetitive processes.  Based in Co-Works, this course will test how we can produce modular work through mainly two-dimensional digital fabrication methods such as: laser cutting, plotter cutting, UV printing, vacuum forming, and other digital fabrication methods. By visiting the Loeb Collection at the Nature Lab and through slides, readings and demonstrations we will explore the greater world of scripted or composed work and the way our universe fits together.  The class will introduce the digital modeling software Rhino as a two dimensional drawing tool to be able to make parts with exact geometries.  By combining design thinking and the artistic creative process we will have group critiques after each of the four major projects to aid in pushing students beyond their perceived limitations.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRACE AND REPETITION: INVESTIGATIONS IN SILKSCREEN AND PLASTER CASTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We are surrounded by repetition and impressions in our everyday lives. But, there is diversity upon inspection of a repeated pattern and there are more ways to take a record than through photography. How do you define trace and repetition based upon what you've experienced? In this course, students will be engaged through critiques, readings, demonstrations, and self-directed projects.  Specifically, they will investigate trace and repetition through the lens of silkscreen and plaster casting. They will learn the silkscreen process and also learn how to create a one and two part mold with plaster. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will develop skill in plaster casting and silkscreen techniques, but also have more opportunity for independent research. The first two weeks of wintersession empower by expanding their repertoire of skills to include silkscreen and plaster casting. The last four weeks consist of two larger projects in which these skills will be incorporated with their own personal interests. At this point in the class, students will receive individual visits and be asked, how do you redefine repetition and trace? How do you apply these concepts to your art practice? Personal expectations of the limits of silkscreen and plaster casting will be challenged and questioned through exposure to contemporary artists and theorists in assigned readings, slideshow format, and in RISD Museum visits.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Finishing techniques, such as felting and dyeing are introduced.  Through weekly assignments, students develop a sample library that serves as a resource for subsequent work. A final project involves planning and sampling for a final garment of the students own design, that is then executed at the end of the course. Consideration of the garment form, its proportion to the body, and the coherence of these elements are integrated into the course.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM AN IDEA TO MEANING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Through drawing and painting we will investigate different subject matter in the development of a personal vision and point of view to create meaningful and moving work. We will work from live models, still-lifes and objects, and explore the use of icons, symbols and images through experimentation with a wide range of media and processes including charcoal, pen and ink, acrylics, objects and collage.&lt;br&gt; Beyond this, the main goal of the course is the development of a working process to strengthen conceptual and expressive abilities. This approach will allow students to communicate concerns with originality and creativity in ways that can later be applied to work in any discipline and medium.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ROCK ON WHICH THE STORM SHALL BEAT: FORT ADAMS INSTALLATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;BR&gt;Historic architectural sites employed as exhibition space have offered artists an expanded context to examine contemporary issues by drawing on the social and cultural past, and provide a resonant place to engage the public. This interdisciplinary course will explore Fort Adams in Newport, Rhode Island as the context for creating site-based work. The Fort complex  - part immaculately restored landmark, part ruin  - and its strategic location on Narragansett Bay, offers a historic site rich in cultural, political and environmental material to draw on and respond to. Readings, slide presentations and discussion will examine artists and exhibitions that address site as context and content. The interdisciplinary structure encourages a dynamic exchange of ideas, methods and expertise that can serve to expand parameters of discipline based studio practice. Proposal research can be directed toward independent or collaborative projects. Students will implement site-based installations on the grounds of Fort Adams, culminating in a public exhibition with student led tours. This is a demanding course requiring multiple travel days and shared responsibility for the exhibition.  &lt;I&gt;Junior and above Elective; &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2232 and SCULP-2232.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course approaches the development of machine knit fabrics and forms as one process, where aspects of form are developed along-side fabric patterns and structures. Students learn advanced construction techniques and knit structure drafting and shaping, in order to further develop their design processes and ideas for knits. Emphasis is placed on experimentation, careful consideration of materials, and research, as ideas about color, pattern, texture, drape, and concept, and working large scale are explored. Fully-fashioned garments are the primary three-dimensional forms to which students apply their ideas, in the form of two major projects. Through the semester, students bring their experience of garment building and shaping, their range of knitting skills and techniques, and their ability to express ideas in knitting to a higher level of resolution. Hand knitting, embellishment, dyeing, printing, finishing, felting and other processes are encouraged and can be integrated into the fabric design and construction.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques for example crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way through out the entire process.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   There is a possibility that some of the work created in this course will be part of a public exhibition. In order to consider work from this course for a public exhibition, a high level of execution and professionalism is expected. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Fee: $125.00&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirement for MAT, MA; MAT &amp; MA only &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This field-based class provides graduate students with an opportunity to experience and examine the dynamics of teaching and learning within an elementary school setting - particularly, Providence's Highlander Charter School. The course is predominantly concerned with the development of teaching and learning strategies with which to incorporate art and design into general education while at the same time maintaining both disciplines' integrity. There is a special emphasis on utilizing art and design to support any school's literacy initiative. The course is constructed with two complementary elements - a participatory component in which pairs of graduate students work collaboratively with a non-art specialist or general classroom teacher. Graduate students have the opportunity to lead small groups of children in formal teaching and learning experiences and to use these opportunities to reflect on matters of content, student understanding, and the effectiveness of communication.  The second component of the course is a seminar that uses the graduate students' authentic classroom experiences as an opportunity to examine a broad range of educational issues that include: the impact of teaching and learning environments, the diversity of learners, arts integration, culturally responsive teaching, technology in the classroom, and classroom management.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirementfor MAT; MAT only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING VISUAL ARTS LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirement for MAT, MA; MAT &amp; MA only &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTS IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Exploring art and design within the context of the non-profit sector is the goal of the seminar. We will examine the roles and responsibilities of non-profit arts organizations from both a practical and ideological perspective to relate them to one's own artistic or design practice or professional aspirations. The course will visit regional arts non-profits, examining their life cycles and the factors that shape an agency's success and/or failure. Organizations investigated may include: arts councils, service organizations, arts centers, alternative spaces, residency programs, community-based initiatives, foundations, and galleries. A deepening understanding of non-profits arts management including mission and vision, leadership, sustainability, relationships to the community and the public will occur. We will ask whom do they serve, what is their relevancy, and what qualitative results do they achieve? The off- campus visits and on-campus guests will serve as core information to researching and proposing a start-up non-profit, analyzing non-profits, or developing successful residency applications. This course will be of special interest to studio practitioners and educators whose professional lives are likely to intersect with arts organizations and agencies in the future.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; MA elective; Elective for other graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLEGIATE STUDIO: DISCIPLINE CENTERED LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Using RISD as a site for the exploration of strategies for studio-based teaching and learning is the goal of the course. It is designed for students who will be teaching during the course of study at RISD or who plan to teach after graduation. The course draws upon the varying expertise and teaching methodologies of RISD faculty and visiting faculty from other institutions to provide graduate students with models of practice. Learning to teach in a generative and attentive manner can bring teaching closer to one's studio practice. The course is composed of readings, reviews, discussion, project assignments, lectures, and peer presentations. The final outcome will be formation of a condensed teaching portfolio including a teaching philosophy, course proposals, a detailed syllabus, sample class assignments and assessment guides.&lt;br&gt; This course may also be taken in any sequence with Collegiate Teaching: Preparation &amp; Reflection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as GRAD 055G.

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNITY ART PROJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Community Art Project (CAP) should be of special interest to RISD studio majors interested in the role of the teaching artist or designer in the community. This field-based course provides students with a service-learning opportunity to explore the dynamics of community-based arts programming for urban youth. The course is based at CityArts, a South Providence community arts center that has a mission to provide free professional arts education to youth ages 8-14. The center's work focuses on the creative process of artmaking and the exploration of ideas and concepts that shape communities and daily life. In this course, RISD students participate as members of collaborative teaching teams responsible for developing creative studio-based learning opportunities for a small group of CityArts youth. Additionally, during the seminar portion of this class, students examine issues and challenges associated with community-based arts practices and programming through research, readings, presentations and a final studio project. Seminar guests, representing varieties of expertise and interests related to community arts education will join the class throughout the semester to provide students with a sense of the diversity of community-based art practices and programming.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Available to all majors sophomores and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media yet drawing can be independent of all other media. Can we make our drawing ventures have resonance? The goal is to understand drawing in a multivalent way through paced experiences and investigations via short research projects, three generative series and development of a sited-drawing plan. Methods will include teamed technical presentations of expertise or interest as well as examples of ancient and historical means of silverpoint, transfer drawings, panoramas and dioramas. Drawing epochs represented in the RISD Museum of Art, collection will be examined (through works by artists such as Wilfredo Lam, Gego, or the Rimpa period Korin Gafu.)  Focused critiques, readings and guided and self-directed independent studio production are components.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;MA elective; Elective for all other graduate students &lt;br&gt; Also offered as GRAD 658G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Department of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design requires MA candidates submit a capstone thesis in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Candidates are given a degree of flexibility in determining the format for this work, but typically it takes the form of either a thesis monograph essay or a thesis book. The thesis monograph essay provides candidates with the opportunity to focus on a deep investigation of a single subject framed within the context of learning and through art and design. An essential characteristic of this approach to the thesis is in how it provides evidence of the candidate's ability to move beyond description to analysis and how she/he is able to place the subject of investigation within the realm of scholarship. The thesis book provides a candidate with the opportunity to make sense of their journey through her/his program in a more autobiographical and documentary manner. The thesis book format affords candidates the opportunity to explore how form can be exploited to visualize research. Whether presented as a thesis monograph essay or thesis book, this capstone requirement provides MA candidates with a formal opportunity to make public her/his understanding about a specific aspect of the nature of arts learning gained through her/his coursework, excursions into the scholarly literature and fieldwork experiences. The purpose here, therefore, is to conceive of the thesis not merely as an academic exercise but also contributing to program development as well as providing a reservoir of understandings that will inform the candidate's future professional practice as an educator.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate requirement for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTIST-TEACHER IN SCHOOL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides students from any major with the opportunity to explore the field of teaching as a possible career option beyond graduation. The course involves completing an internship with an art teacher two days a week in either public or private schools. Students enrolled in this course will hopefully, be able to translate some of their excitement for art and design to the school setting, and in doing so, become a valuable resource to both the art teacher and his/her students.  Students taking this course are also required to attend and participate in a weekly seminar to discuss their experiences and to further explore a variety of issues related to teaching art and design at the K-12 level. Selected readings, a directed reflective journal, presentations, and a leave-behind contribution to the assigned school are among the assignments for this course.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Undergraduates only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN EDUCATION STUDIO WORKSHOP: PLACE BASED LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The urban landscape is comprised of designed elements at multiple scales, ranging from a city's infrastructure to the architectural details of street furniture and building fagades. Although people are more and more likely to inhabit urban places, whether a small town or large metropolis, it is rare that we look carefully at the details and making of a place in such a way that we truly know the "genius loci" or spirit of the place. The unique meeting of the geographic underpinnings of a place, its natural resources and amenities that made it a likely place for settlement and the layers of design undertakings over time that build the structure of a city are critical to place-making. Knowing and understanding the environment is a critical piece of design education that can take many forms and be addressed through projects at many scales.&lt;BR&gt;  This course is designed to build your vocabulary for understanding the design of place and then provide opportunities to use your skills as teachers of art + design to translate that vocabulary into projects that can open up the designed world to young people. We will look at design of place and urban space from three vantage points relating to children: PLACES FOR CHILDREN; PLACES AND CHILDREN; and PLACES BY CHILDREN. To address these issues, we will conduct a series of design exercises exploring the urban environment working with scale, perspective, and mapping elements of the city's built and natural environment. In addition, we will look at the local and global role of sustainable design in the fields of architecture and urbanism and work to develop ways to present these integrated design challenges to young people.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Graduate requirement for MAT; Open to other Grads by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

MA candidates are also encouraged to identify potential internship sites and the Department is very willing make an institutional advance to an individual or organization in order to facilitate and establish an internship agreement. It is important for candidates to recognize that while they might wish to have a very particular internship, the ultimate placement is very much dependent upon the readiness of a particular site to accept an intern. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
