   <COURSETITLE>CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL HAZARDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscape architects and designers in other disciplines are taking an increasingly important role in addressing complex questions related to climate change and natural hazards.  These questions involve intersecting cultural and scientific issues.  This course is designed to equip landscape architects and other designers with an essential foundation in physical and social scientific aspects of climate change so that they may better engage with these questions.  Although it is impossible to cover the breadth of necessary topics and issues in a single semester, students will learn to analyze and access the scientific literature so that they can individually extend their education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emphasis will also be placed on essential skills and disciplinary approaches to enable more effective collaboration in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts.  This includes addressing cultural and disciplinary differences in approaches to scientific concepts such as validity and uncertainty, and examining epistemological aspects of science.  This course is an essential primer in climate change and natural hazards for any student who hopes to address these issues in their work or to work in policy based contexts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open undergraduates only; sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as LAEL-2012; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3D CITY AND LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>3D visualizations of cities and landscapes capture the imagination and make abstract data tangible. They are used as backdrops in animations, to convey planning scenarios, and increasingly to spatialize different kinds of data from social and physical sciences. This course equips students with tools and skills to create city and landscape models and visualize data using them. Custom software tools will enable students to quickly realize 3D models and visualizations in Rhino and subsequently explore the ethical implications of these models using related readings and class discussions. Students will obtain and utilize geographic data, learning principles and techniques that are adaptable to multiple software platforms. Readings and discussions address the ethics of data-driven spatial visualizations. Students at all levels of coding experience will have the ability to advance their skills, and using materials provided in class will be able to create projects on their own. Rhino software and experience with the program are required. Students interested in adapting methods to other platforms will also be supported. Samples and a full syllabus can be seen at www.peterstempel.com.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as ARCH-1727, INTAR-1727 and LDAR-1727; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GEODESIGN IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Geodesign addresses complex time dependent problems such as climate adaptation by incorporating stakeholder feedback and simulations into iterative planning processes. Students in this seminar will explore both the possibilities and limitations of geodesign by participating in RISD's 2020 International Geodesign Collaboration (IGC) project focusing on coastal adaptation. IGC tests a globally comparable range of strategies in sites around the world to support the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. In class activities include design charrettes, stakeholder and expert visits, using Rhino and GIS to prepare visioning scenarios, analyzing social science survey data. Homework will consist of academic reading (+/- 10 - 15 pages/week) supported by study guides or completing concise drawing tasks on some occasions. A limited number of research assistantships will be available to support GIS work, an evaluative study, and publication of results in an academic journal (participation will be recognized with acknowledgement and exceptional contributions with co-authorship). Experience with Rhino or GIS is recommended to maximize the value of the class but not required. Students interested in developing thesis projects around coastal adaptation to sea level rise are encouraged to participate, as relevant materials and subject matter will be included. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to all majors juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as ARCH-1730, INTAR-1730, LAEL-1730 and LDAR-1730; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These collections laid the foundation for much of  the Victoria and Albert Museum collections (V&amp;A)  that in turn influenced the creation of RISD and  the RISD Museum in 1877.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will examine design and fashion,  naturalist journals, and literature as a means to  develop the students design vocabulary and  materials palate. Students will compare the  tastes and techniques of the Victorian era to  contemporary design practices, with case studies  of designers utilizing the natural world as a  resource and source for design. Weekly lectures  will introduce students to artists and designers  of the 19th century  and compare them to  contemporary artists and designers. These  introductory lectures will be paired each week  with a specific material examination and hand-on  exploration via materials demonstrations and a  sample notebook. We will engage in readings,  group discussions, critique of student  "Naturalist Journals," materials demonstrations,  and examine historic and contemporary Museum  objects within each theme material.  &lt;BR&gt; Field trips to the RISD Museum will be augmented  by visits to the Edna W. Lawrence Nature Lab,  RISD Materials library, The Providence Athenaeum,  The Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown  University, The New Bedford Whaling Museum, and  The Museum of Natural History, Roger Williams  Park.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost:  $20.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to Apparel Design majors only; sophomore and  above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and  permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN FASHION THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Topics in Fashion Theory" complements the design history survey, "History of Dress." ("History of Dress" is not a prerequisite). This seminar will introduce students to theoretical debates in fashion theory, responding to scholars who define fashion as the cultural construction of embodied identity. Through the manipulation of the visual and tactile symbols of clothing (cut, cloth, texture and color) fashion expresses, however imprecisely, a configuration of individual attributes and attitudes that persons seek to communicate. But fashion most likely productively draws upon "recurrent instabilities" in collective social identities, argues Fred Davis, including masculinity versus femininity, androgyny versus singularity, license versus restraint and conformity versus rebellion. Fashion can do so because social identities are rarely the stable amalgams we take them to be: they shift over the course of a lifetime and are prodded by social and technological change. Drawing on scholarship in a range of disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, gender studies and queer theory, we will explore clothing's role in marking, or alternately containing, deflecting or sublimating, those aspects of identity linked to gender, sexuality, class, race, religion and nation. Noting that leading designers use the catwalk to present experimental clothes that often communicate brand values and the designer's identity, we will explore the extent to which fashion is currently formulating effective social commentary. &lt;BR&gt; The class integrates reading and reading responses with discussion and visual analysis of clothing and fashion across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Reading responses will help students develop four short written projects that assess and analyze debates encountered in class discussion and readings. Class time will include in-class writing and peer review. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Apparel majors only; sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on drawing topics pertaining to architecture. Drawing is treated as a space for architectural research and/or as an autonomous work of architecture. The notion that drawing serves architecture merely as representation is questioned and critiqued. The theoretical and technical focus on the process of drawing will cultivate and address issues that have for hundreds of years served as the core of the architecture discipline. Simultaneously, the research may allow for the generation or assimilation of ideas, cultures and knowledge from other fields into architecture. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Two interrelated aspects of design are pursued: 1) the elements of composition and their formal, spatial, and tectonic  manipulation and 2) meanings conveyed by formal choices and transformations. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50 - $200 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department,  course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STEEL STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course reviews the role of metals in architecture, focusing on the fundamentals of steel analysis and design in architecture;  and examines typical framing techniques and systems. Topics  include construction issues, floor framing systems, column analysis  and design, steel detailing and light gauge steel framing materials and systems.  In addition the course introduces students to lateral force  resistance systems in steel construction and exposes them to alternatives to steel such as aluminum and fiberglass. By the end of the course,  students will be aware of the role of metals in architectural design and construction; design and detail simple steel structural systems; and proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The study of basic concepts of Human Environmental Comforts. Inherent within 'physio-environ' considerations are principles of temperature, humidity, heat transfer, air movement, and hydrostatics. These principles will be studied in terms of their abstract physics and mathematics, through empirical benchmarking and as the basis for a design proposal that includes considerations of larger scale strategies as well as assemblies. Emphasis will be placed on the principles behind the technology, the behavioral characteristics and the qualities of the systems' operation considered in making building design decisions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Open to NCSS Concentrators pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will utilize the content, topic, and conceit of measure as a pinhole through which to see the world of Directed Design Research. Directed Design Research is an alternative to Thesis, which lays out a specific territory of inquiry and encourages students to identify the topic and scope of their work, emanating from this specific point of departure. The seminar will lay out a series of methods, techniques, and exercises related to the exploration of measure, asking each student to then define a territory of inquiry within this delimited field. The deliverables for the Scope Seminar include a thoughtfully delimited and actionable statement of the intended design research, the documentation of a minimum of three methodologies or approaches to be utilized in the design research, and a well-wrought syllabus that includes: a weekly breakdown of tasks and deliverables, relevant references and precedents properly cited, and a concise text (3 pages maximum) describing the research activities to be undertaken. &lt;br&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on computational topics pertaining to architecture. Computational techniques and computational ideas are explored through making, writing, reading, and discussion. Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; For Fall and Spring Semesters:  &lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to CTC Concentrators and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; For Wintersession:  &lt;br&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Theory offerings in the architecture department are deliberately consistent or complementary with our pedagogy, born and raised in an arts college. Theory based courses have a basis in empiricism, direct observation and experience of creative processes. Recognizing that discovery and invention often come between existing matrices of thought, offerings may be from disciplines other than architecture or branches of knowledge other than art and design. &lt;br&gt;  Objectives of the theory component of our curriculum are to: &lt;br&gt; 1. Expand the capacity to speculate productively.&lt;br&gt; 2. Develop the skeptic's eye and mind.&lt;br&gt; 3. Equip the ability to recognize connections that trigger discovery and invention. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WOOD STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will review the fundamentals of wood in architecture with a focus on wood materials and construction systems and lumber and timber structural analysis and design.  Work includes timber systems consisting of conventional framing trusses, laminates, built-up sections and connections. In addition, this course will review the principles of structural loads; gravity, lateral, live and dead.  The concept of lateral resistance through standard wood framing systems will be explored. Manufactured lumber has become a major part of today's wood construction industry and the design and detailing of these materials will be explored in depth. By the end of the course, students will be aware of the role of wood materials in architectural design and construction and be able to design and detail simple Lumber and Timber structural systems.  They will be able to proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis. This course will provide the student with a good understanding of the material and the common structural and architectural systems used in today's practice. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major Requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by the Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; For Fall and Spring Semesters:  &lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to CTC Concentrators and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; For Wintersession:  &lt;br&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD ARCHITECTURE: FROM PRE-HISTORY TO PRE-MODERN: IDEAS AND ARTIFACTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This history of architecture course, co-taught by an architectural historian and an architect, introduces key ideas, forces, and techniques that have shaped world architecture through the ages prior to the modern period. The course is based on critical categories, ranging from indigenous and vernacular architecture, to technology, culture, and representation. The lectures and discussions present systems of thought, practice and organization, emphasizing both historical and global interconnectedness, and critical architectural differences and anomalies. Each topic will be presented through case studies accompanied by relevant texts. The students will be expected to engage in the discussion groups, prepare material for these discussions, write about, and be examined on the topics. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors &lt;BR&gt; Art History credit for Architecture majors &lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS DISCURSIVE WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thesis Discursive Workshop utilizes Wintersession to hone students' discursive skills, both written and oral, so that they can choreograph a robust discussion around their work. This course establishes a consistent discursive trajectory to the ongoing individual design development of the thesis project that begins in the Fall. In addition to providing a forum in which students might draw out, articulate, and position some of the central claims and aims of their thesis work, this course also aims to instigate careful thought about the written component of the eventual thesis book and the way that this written component might inform or be informed by design work. The assignments of the course are designed to create the infrastructure of a student's eventual thesis book, the elements of any/many book(s). They are not the book content itself, but organize, clarify, define, contextualize, reference, etc. the work contained therein. These elements, for the purposes of this course, are: synopsis (back page/cover flap summary), "cover art", bibliography, table of contents, title, index, and appendix/appendices. In this five-week intensive workshop, students will develop and refine the following skills, relating each development to a component of their eventual book via an assignment:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. Crafting the thesis polemic or narrative;  &lt;BR&gt; 2. Positioning the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 3. Contextualizing and formatting the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 4. Curating and editing the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 5.

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: MATERIAL PROPOSITIONS: OAXACA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Oaxaca City is situated in the mountains midway between Mexico City and the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO in recognition of its historic buildings and archaeological sites. The city's colonial history is intertwined with indigenous cultures that reside along the city edges. It is also the source of a rich contemporary art scene rooted in the current political and social climate of the area. Home to an extensive network of art centers, cultural institutions, and artisanal crafts, the place provides a rich inventory of opportunities for material observation, experimentation, and making.  &lt;br&gt; The primary focus of the studio is to weave together cultural research, material exploration, and full-scale construction to explore the resonance between traditional craft practices and contemporary techniques of design. Students will be exposed to materials based on the vernacular of the area-adobe, stone, brick, lime, bamboo, and locally made encaustic tiles-and introduced to ways in which to translate their properties into new applications and processes of assembly. The goal is to engage participants in the design of a collaborative project while understanding the culture and interests of the community it will serve. These hands-on explorations will be facilitated by community-based partners in the spirit of generating local innovation.   &lt;br&gt; The secondary component of the course will provide an opportunity for observation and visual transcription of experience through drawing and other forms of 2-D material work informed by local resources. Fieldwork will be supported by visits to cultural sites, and daily discussions will address the use of materials in design as a force to promote reimagining their applications. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $2,180.00 - airfare  not included. &lt;br&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on drawing topics pertaining to architecture. Drawing is treated as a space for architectural research and/or as an autonomous work of architecture. The notion that drawing serves architecture merely as representation is questioned and critiqued. The theoretical and technical focus on the process of drawing will cultivate and address issues that have for hundreds of years served as the core of the architecture discipline. Simultaneously, the research may allow for the generation or assimilation of ideas, cultures and knowledge from other fields into architecture. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Theory offerings in the architecture department are deliberately consistent or complementary with our pedagogy, born and raised in an arts college. Theory based courses have a basis in empiricism, direct observation and experience of creative processes. Recognizing that discovery and invention often come between existing matrices of thought, offerings may be from disciplines other than architecture or branches of knowledge other than art and design. &lt;br&gt;  Objectives of the theory component of our curriculum are to: &lt;br&gt; 1. Expand the capacity to speculate productively.&lt;br&gt; 2. Develop the skeptic's eye and mind.&lt;br&gt; 3. Equip the ability to recognize connections that trigger discovery and invention. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARCH AS MICRO-SYSTEM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>An ecosystem is defined as "a community of interacting organisms and their environment functions as an ecological unit." So, how to design a "micro-ecosystem" as an architectural unit structurally and functionally? In this course, students will apply their research from natural materials, structures, systems, and behaviors, and then develop an integrative "micro-system." Using the RISD Nature Lab collections as primary resources, students will primarily conduct in-depth research for different types and scales of forms, from macroscopic to microscopic, from static to dynamic. While learning to use fundamental architectural analysis and design strategies, students will be expected to bring their own backgrounds into developing their "micro-system."   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; To reinforce the logic of the concept, students will develop components of their "micro-system" with parametric prototyping. The Grasshopper, a plug-in from Rhinoceros, will be taught and utilized as a tool to model per-formative, tectonic, and kinetic systems. By learning to create a series of prototypes of their concepts, students will gain the opportunity to create iterations of various "micro-systems." The final project will be a synthesized design proposal with a self-determined "site" dependent on students' concepts and their architectural functions. During this course, students will produce physical and digital models, as well as architectural diagrams as a series of speculative demonstration of their research-based and performance-oriented design. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMMATERIAL MEDIUMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What makes a digital surface appear sticky? Can a 3d model drip, or ooze?     Material behavior and the forces that give material form are intertwined with any architecture or craft based practice. However, 3D models are not tethered to our laws of physics, and the illusion of photorealistic rendering makes it easy to overlook that digital mediums are inherently immaterial and fictional.    In this introductory course, we will tackle digital materiality through rendering, physics simulations, and animation. This course does not aim to produce replicas of real-world materials, but to use the lens of material behavior to author new forms of expression. We will treat rendering engines as a pixel generating medium that can articulate properties beyond just color and form. Then we will adopt faux-physics-simulations as a device to squish, dissolve, and expand the 3d model into malleable digital matter. As we progress through workshops in rendering fundamentals and simulating techniques, students will propose hyper-materials imbued with weight, thickness, messiness, and surprise akin to a natural splatter of ink. For the final project, Students will craft their own language of digital mark-making, culminating in a final image or animation.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;/BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

What is lost or gained when the digital becomes physical? Does authorship begin or end at material translation? Through a series of connected assignments, demonstrations, and tutorials, students will be introduced to a variety digital fabrication methods that will challenge traditional notions of authorship and materiality.  Relying heavily on open source 3D model repositories, students will be asked to choose a digital artifact. From there, a series of material translations will transform and redefine the initial object. In doing so, students will be forced to directly confront notions of originality and authenticity.  In addition to being introduced to 3D modeling, printing, and scanning techniques - students will be able to navigate the space between fabrication, and digital representation.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEMORY SYSTEMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Architecture will always be built in place of, (or in addition to) the memory of something or some place that came before. Similarly, our experience, (or perception) of architecture will always be influenced by the memories we carry in our minds. In this class each student will individually answer the question: How can I reconcile this knowledge of memory to inform the design of space? Over six weeks students will have the opportunity to engage memory in the development of a personalized system, (or design process) leading to the final design of a 'memory space'. The first part of this architecture course will engage fundamental design skills used every day by architects through a series of memory exercises. We will hand draw to see our memories, remember through iterative physical study modeling, and contain our memories by way of digital modeling. Part two of this course will see students working toward the final design of a 'memory space'. Building off of part one, fundamental design skills such as hand drawing, physical study modeling and digital modeling will be used again, emphasizing the importance of repetition as a device for memory. This 'memory space' will utilize memory with respect and sensitivity to the memory of a 'place'. Throughout the six weeks of class students will be asked to articulate thoughts and strategies through writing and presenting finished work to the class, helping students test and strengthen their executed ideas. Course reading will help students contextualize memory in cross-disciplinary ways, such as understanding what memory means to a cognitive neuroscientist. By the end of six weeks students will have created a system for designing that can be used and built upon in future design work. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $120.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How do we, as architects, respond to the increasing need for sustainable and healthy design that respects the uniqueness of place?  How do we find inspiration and nurture it to its final expression?  Students taking this course will discover methods for integrating naturally occurring site conditions with architectural constructions in ways that do not ostracize cultural or natural contexts.  They will identify and utilize existing topographical patterns and indigenous materials and building practices to develop a pavilion design for RISD Beach at Tillinghast Farm.  Design iteration will incorporate McNeel Rhinoceros and Autodesk Revit to utilize the strengths of each program.  Pace and repetition of exercises will deepen students' ability to analyze, process, and integrate their learning to the level of automaticity.  This, in turn, will contribute to design thinking, creating, and making that is iterative, globally responsible, and culturally ethical. &lt;br&gt; Goals/Objectives:  This course will introduce a digital and empirical production process that is quick, iterative, and reflective to design a pavilion for RISD Beach at Tillinghast Farm.  Cross-medium design will leverage the strengths of multiple computer programs to create an output that is not restricted, but enhanced, by these mediums.  The workflow process will include observation, hand drawing, computer modeling in Rhino, proofing schematic design in Autodesk Revit, and rendering on Adobe Creative Suite.  Fluency in Rhino, Revit, or Adobe is not a prerequisite but will be cultivated in this course.  Production of a physical model using a 3D printer is optional.  Students will have exposure to numerous methods of integrating natural and constructed systems which will impact design thinking long after this Wintersession course is completed. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE SEMINAR: DISCIPLINARITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Anyone following contemporary debates in architecture knows that there are as many definitions of architecture's disciplinarity as there are people who attempt to define it. In the current spate of publications on this topic, Mark Jarzombek declares architecture to be a failed discipline; Jane Rendell claims that architecture is a 'subject' subsuming several disciplines; Mark Wigley ruminates upon the prosthetic nature of the discipline to the sciences; Bob Somol and Sarah Whiting attempt to recover a Foucaultian disciplinarity in which norms, principles and traditions are supplanted by performative practice; Akos Moravansky argues that the disciplinarity of architecture resists the discursive approach embodied in post-1968 theory; Keller Easterling seeks "the trapdoor into another habit of mind" by eschewing narrow categories of thought for more inclusive ones; Sylvia Lavin uses the analogy of the 'kiss' between an installation and the architecture that houses it as a model of architectural inter-disciplinarity as media interaction; and Hal Foster and Michael Speaks face off on the relative merits of design intelligence and critical distance. How can a student of architecture ever gain a foothold in this complex and confusing debate? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At stake in the debates over disciplinarity is the question: how can we identify architecture's categories of knowledge, and how did the categorization of knowledge become a priority? This Disciplinarity seminar will historically situate the circumstances of architecture's emerging disciplinarity, and thematize it through three seemingly disparate but operatively identical lenses: the aesthetic, the historic, and the technological. Although the debates cited above appear unruly at first blush, fundamentally they aggregate around the relative merits of defining disciplinary categories of knowledge either too narrowly or too broadly, focusing either on architecture's autonomy or its extra-disciplinary appropriations. In addition to architecture's various categories of knowledge, the seminar will consider the influence of disciplinarity on our practices, considering how various classifications of architectural knowledge affect its techniques, standards, and formats of dissemination. From its Foucaultian framing to its current incarnations, Disciplinarity will unpack the construction of architecture's disciplinarity, and shed some much-needed light on what it means for architects to be disciplinary.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; M.ARCH 3-YR graduate students  only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THEORY SEMINAR: MAKING DISCOURSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a theoretical seminar course that will be concerned with ideas and architectural knowledge that may be cultivated and tested through discourse.  The course discussions will focus on an expansive role of architectural tools. While acknowledging a wealth of disciplinary conventions, histories and theories, this course recognizes that the forms of representation within the discipline of architecture have the capacity to affect the discipline of architecture and are not fixed. Students in this course will be expected to build upon their previous architectural education through a series of directed projects aimed at advancing architectural theories, ideas and methods. Some of the questions that students will be expected to address are: What are the practical, theoretical, and creative implications of a drawing that functions as architecture? How do architects change the way we make and think thanks to digital media? How do architects represent and model natural forces?  How do architects express political or social agendas?  What is the nature of an architectural contribution to interdisciplinary discourse? How can representation enable new kinds of artistic and research-based practices for architecture? Students will be expected to self-direct their process while framing their work intellectually in a seminar environment. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate Major requirement; Architecture 2-year majors only &lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year M.ARCH Advanced Standing students only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The model's role is understood as a medium for operations. The contemporary digital model is delimited and constrained by architectural software. This course recognizes that expertise in multiple digital modeling software-including those aligned with Building Information Modeling (BIM), fabrication, and animation-is as imperative as are skills to manipulate, undermine, link, automate and hack the media that dominate the discipline of architecture. As is the case with "Drawings," models are not merely technical, but the underpinnings of an iterative, creative, synthetic and reflective creative process. A series of prompts engage the computational principles that underpin all digital modeling software. This "under the hood" approach is balanced by "over the hood" approaches that see students designing workflows, automation and output between software and material.

   <COURSETITLE>CORE 2 STUDIO: CONSTRUCTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second core studio addresses the agency of the building to simultaneously construct new spatial, social, and material orders in the context of the contemporary city.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The second core studio situates architecture as the strategic interplay of spatial and constructive concepts towards specific aesthetic, social, and performative ends. The studio seeks to create a productive friction between abstract orders (form, pattern, organization), technical systems (structure, envelope), and the contingencies of real-world conditions (site, politics, environment). The studio operates within a specific cultural framework in which students link disciplinary methods to extra-disciplinary issues, with concentrated forays into the realms of structure, material, environmentalism, and urbanism. Students iteratively develop architectural concepts, ethical positions, and experimental working methods through a series of focused architectural design projects with increasing degrees of complexity, culminating in the design of a mid-scale public building in an urban context.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $195.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUILDING PRINTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course brings together printmaking and architecture, with their respective modes of working and sensibilities. There is long tradition connecting the two disciplines; here we will focus on a fundamental, physical connection, experimenting with materials and ways of assembling them to make prints. We will think of the press bed almost as a construction site. Collecting materials from everyday life, we will explore their characteristics and qualities--textures, patterns, opacities and translucencies--in the process of transferring them onto paper. The main technique of the course will be monotype, but we may also employ other techniques, such as soft ground, collagraph, and laser etching depending of students' experience and interest. We will start with simple monochrome prints, progressively moving to more open-ended, elaborate and ambitious experiments, including multicolor prints and three-dimensional assemblages. Students will produce weekly sets of prints exploring themes and variations. Above all, the work of the course should be thought of as an opportunity to develop careful experimental habits.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $60.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2080: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; PRINT-2080: Open to Printmaking majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2080: Open to all other majors.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How have female architects outside of the United States impacted their societies? And, what do these architects' accomplishments and the challenges they face reveal about the intersections of architecture, sexism, racism, colonization, and globalization?  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; These thematic questions will guide students through the case studies of 13 female, non-American, mostly non-white architects. Weekly readings will offer in depth study of well-known figures, such as Lina Bo Bardi, and significant, but lesser known architects such as Nadia Tromp, the managing director of Ntsika Architects, a 100% black, female-owned practice in South Africa. Students will conclude the course by writing a term paper on contemporary female architecture. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN FARMING &amp; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3-credit elective studio seminar fulfills RISD's goal for meaningful community engagement by recognizing the power of affiliating with members of our Providence community on urban agriculture and permaculture initiatives. The course seeks to introduce the history of organic farming and explore the developments in contemporary urban practices.  Students will acquire an understanding of the topic through field demonstrations and case study analysis which will lead up to work on a small-scale design build initiative for a community garden with a local partner. &lt;br&gt; Social justice extends to the environmental issues in multiple ways. Providence, Rhode Island, is made up of diverse communities where, in 2015, more than 1 in 5 children in Providence have grown up in poverty, with a medium household income of $34,000 or less.  There are many local non-profits that serve our communities including with urban farming activities that provide fresh food and places to gather. Urban agriculture has the potential to strengthen local communities and has many social benefits including economic development through food production and other activities in the food network, reducing food deserts, enhancing food security, the reduction of the use of fossil-fuels, and the transformation of urban environments through the introduction of the green spaces that highlight the nutrient cycle.  Urban farming creates more sustainable urban environments by re-establishing interrelated natural systems, promoting biodiversity and reducing urban impact on the water cycle. Finally, these spaces can become a locus for community where youth and adults can engage natural systems though passive or active undertakings and educational uses.    &lt;br&gt; Academia has an important role to play in advancing these community efforts. We will look at appropriate methods of community engagement and Creative Placemaking to explore how design can play a role in nurturing culturally-diverse vibrant neighborhoods while creating positive change.  We will work closely with local community partners, such as the FarmFresh RI, Southside Community Land Trust and the African Alliance of RI to understand and support their work through creative thinking.    &lt;br&gt; Each student will be asked to prepare two projects. The first will be a case study analysis of existing examples of urban farms across the country to learn from the unique ways people are farming in different cities. In the second project, we will work with our community partners in the field to design and build a small project that will be part of an existing garden. Finally, we will document the process that emerges through community conversations in order to share our process and results.  &lt;br&gt; At the end of the semester students will be required to participate in two build sessions outside of class period at the project site as part of course work. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2340: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; INTAR-2340: Open to Interior Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; LDAR-2340: Open to Landscape Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2340: Open to all majors.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will acquire an understanding of the topic through field demonstrations and case study analysis which will lead up to work on a small-scale design build initiative for a community garden with a local partner. &lt;br&gt; Social justice extends to the environmental issues in multiple ways. Providence, Rhode Island, is made up of diverse communities where, in 2015, more than 1 in 5 children in Providence have grown up in poverty, with a medium household income of $34,000 or less.  There are many local non-profits that serve our communities including with urban farming activities that provide fresh food and places to gather. Urban agriculture has the potential to strengthen local communities and has many social benefits including economic development through food production and other activities in the food network, reducing food deserts, enhancing food security, the reduction of the use of fossil-fuels, and the transformation of urban environments through the introduction of the green spaces that highlight the nutrient cycle.  Urban farming creates more sustainable urban environments by re-establishing interrelated natural systems, promoting biodiversity and reducing urban impact on the water cycle. Finally, these spaces can become a locus for community where youth and adults can engage natural systems though passive or active undertakings and educational uses.    &lt;br&gt; Academia has an important role to play in advancing these community efforts. We will look at appropriate methods of community engagement and Creative Placemaking to explore how design can play a role in nurturing culturally-diverse vibrant neighborhoods while creating positive change.  We will work closely with local community partners, such as the FarmFresh RI, Southside Community Land Trust and the African Alliance of RI to understand and support their work through creative thinking.    &lt;br&gt; Each student will be asked to prepare two projects. The first will be a case study analysis of existing examples of urban farms across the country to learn from the unique ways people are farming in different cities. In the second project, we will work with our community partners in the field to design and build a small project that will be part of an existing garden. Finally, we will document the process that emerges through community conversations in order to share our process and results.  &lt;br&gt; At the end of the semester students will be required to participate in two build sessions outside of class period at the project site as part of course work. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; LDAR-2340: Open to Landscape Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2340: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; INTAR-2340: Open to Interior Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2340: Open to all majors.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CORE 2 STUDIO: CONSTRUCTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second core studio addresses the agency of the building to simultaneously construct new spatial, social, and material orders in the context of the contemporary city.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The second core studio situates architecture as the strategic interplay of spatial and constructive concepts towards specific aesthetic, social, and performative ends. The studio seeks to create a productive friction between abstract orders (form, pattern, organization), technical systems (structure, envelope), and the contingencies of real-world conditions (site, politics, environment). The studio operates within a specific cultural framework in which students link disciplinary methods to extra-disciplinary issues, with concentrated forays into the realms of structure, material, environmentalism, and urbanism. Students iteratively develop architectural concepts, ethical positions, and experimental working methods through a series of focused architectural design projects with increasing degrees of complexity, culminating in the design of a mid-scale public building in an urban context.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $195.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Student's intent upon becoming registered architects in the USA after graduation should enroll in the AXP as soon as possible.  AXP is the internship program required by all registration jurisdictions. The work experience accomplished during ARCH-2199, the department's minimum Internship experience (280 hours) can be recorded as acceptable experience in the AXP (3740 hours) and thus accelerate one's pace towards architectural licensure. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Website: http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internship  s.aspx  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; To register, go to www.risdcareers.com (ArtWorks) &lt;BR&gt; Course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Ceramic Sculpture will cover a range of concepts, traditions and techniques that are specific to the disciplines of both ceramics and sculpture. Projects will revolve around the topics of space, structure and form and the development of ideas. Techniques and processes including hand building, surface treatment and glazes will be covered. Clay is a subtle material allowing an exchange between the medium and the self. Through making, your skills and confidence will develop giving you more control over the objects you wish to realize. Students will approach these dynamics through installation, large construction and small-scale object making. Designed for students at an advanced level, using clay as a primary material and involving a variety of processes and forming methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Ceramics majors &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors for 3-credits pending seat availability and permission of Department Head. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Ceramic Department, course not available via web registration.  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CERAMICS AND PRINT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Ceramics and printmaking have a shared ethos in the production of multiples and process-driven technical methods. This is reflected in industry but is not often explored in an academic context. This course would be the first at RISD to explore the rich resources of the Ceramics and Printmaking Departments to promote research into innovative ways to combine the disciplines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For almost three centuries ceramics have been enhanced by printed elements. The combination of ceramic and print technologies have tremendous potential for new applications in functional and sculptural approaches to ceramic multiples and printed editions. RISD has all the facilities in ceramics and printmaking required to pursue research in this field. Students will learn ceramic techniques such as hand-building, throwing, slip casting and the RAM press to create forms to hold screenprinted, intaglio, relief, lithographic and digital images. Historical techniques will be presented and new methods and combinations will be developed. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all students; junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as PRINT-3208; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRANSLATING WITH CLAY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Each of us sees, processes, translates and expresses data in different ways. Some of our differences are subtle some are strikingly unique. As we develop our understanding of ourselves as artists and designers we can grow by looking at the way we work through metacognition. Metacognition is simply thinking about how we think. Multidisciplinary projects and active in-class conversations about the similarities and differences in how each of us think can help us to understand: what makes us as individual artists unique how other artists think new ways of thinking that we can incorporate into our practice. In class exercises, explorations and tutorials along with 3 multiphase multidisciplinary studio projects will culminate with a final project over the last two weeks of the semester. Ceramics will be the primary(50%) medium used and will be accompanied with various 2D and other 3D mediums. Additionally there will be a few brief writing assignments. Pinch pots, coil making and slab making in clay will be taught along with an overview of glazing. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMMERSIVE SPACES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the relationships between new media languages and physical space. Building from the history and aesthetics of installation art and relational theater and based on conceptualizations such as "Relational Architecture" by Lozano-Hemmer and the "Poetics of Augmented Space" by Lev Manovich, we will learn to leverage interactive and audiovisual elements in order to design spatial experiences that are media-rich, relational, and responsive. We will use software, video-projectors, sensors and VR equipment, and explore emergent techniques including video-mapping, computer vision and augmented reality. We will learn to deploy not only vision, but also hearing and haptics to create immersive and multi-sensory environments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Class is comprised of lectures, hands-on workshops and individual projects. Students will gain a deep understanding of topics of spatial thinking and user-generated experiences related to space, as well as a theoretical and critical understanding of the history of installation and interactive arts. Although not a prerequisite, basic coding or scripting knowledge (Processing, javascript, or MAX, Touch Designer, etc.) is recommended. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offerd as DM-2039 and IDISC-2039; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this historical survey, we analyze the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. We examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged. We make connections across decades by focusing on the recurring themes of language, futurism, simulation, hyper-reality, transnationality and information. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; D+M majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year graduate students. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by D+M Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Participants in the Technological Landscapes research group are passionate but critical observers of today's living environment in relation to ubiquitous, integrated, and emerging technologies. It is important that we draw inspiration not necessarily just from art, design, but from real-world events influenced or caused by technological advancement and/or failure.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This research group will foster a dynamic, and highly collaborative environment through discussions, readings and excursions. Participants are expected to drive and determine the focus and interests of the group through conversations and consensus. In turn this will feed each participant's artistic sensibility and will form the conceptual foundations necessary for building a strong critical art work. Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  The projects, individual or collaborative, should be thought of on a scale of landscape physical or virtual. One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $200.00  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $200.00  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required. Course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Please contact the Instructor with any questions and for more details. &lt;BR&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL THEORY + ARTISTIC RESEARCH IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar course analyzes the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. As a group, we will examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we will address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt; Within this course, students will be expected to identify, analyze, and critique readings that critically inform and underwrite the foundations of their written thesis and studio practice. Students will contribute to the focus of the course through discussions and writings that contextualize their own work as it relates to critical theory. Class time will be mainly used for discussion of readings and concepts, critique of work and to introduce methods and theory. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; D+M majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year graduate students. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by D+M Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the relationships between new media languages and physical space. Building from the history and aesthetics of installation art and relational theater and based on conceptualizations such as "Relational Architecture" by Lozano-Hemmer and the "Poetics of Augmented Space" by Lev Manovich, we will learn to leverage interactive and audiovisual elements in order to design spatial experiences that are media-rich, relational, and responsive. We will use software, video-projectors, sensors and VR equipment, and explore emergent techniques including video-mapping, computer vision and augmented reality. We will learn to deploy not only vision, but also hearing and haptics to create immersive and multi-sensory environments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Class is comprised of lectures, hands-on workshops and individual projects. Students will gain a deep understanding of topics of spatial thinking and user-generated experiences related to space, as well as a theoretical and critical understanding of the history of installation and interactive arts. Although not a prerequisite, basic coding or scripting knowledge (Processing, javascript, or MAX, Touch Designer, etc.) is recommended. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;I&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offerd as CTC-2039 and IDISC-2039; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Multisensory Practices offers a studio-lab context to explore modes of integrating alternative sensory modalities in artworks. By understanding cognitive processes active in perception, we will look at methodologies for making embodied sensory environments that stimulate experiential encounters. Through experimentation, lectures on cognitive science, and guided discussions on artistic practices, we will carefully examine elements within and around the work that communicate intent, mediate the audience's sensory experience and stimulate embodied connections through various perceptual channels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will focus on providing tools to engage audiences at varying affective levels through an understanding of human sensibilities and methods of communication. We will discuss scientific readings about cognition, perception and the senses - identifying a sensorial spectrum including proprioception, spatial information and time - as well as their use in multisensory artworks. Through studio research, dialogue and critiques, students will then explore how to employ the senses into felt content. Centrally and throughout the course, students will be encouraged to find alternative means to communicate intent into sensorial encounters with the work.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The students will be provided with scientific readings on sense perception and installation art, as well as workshops on loudspeaker and video projector arrays. Lectures by guest speakers and a field trip to experience multisensory works will augment our research in this studio course as well.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FUTURE MIND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Can catastrophic thinking hold the key to true happiness? This question and more will be explored in this studio informed seminar that proposes a practical transdisciplinary research and artistic methodology for a troubling digital age of information over-saturation and despair. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Employing a nomadic, tangential, and rhizomatic methodology for investigation and making, we will draw upon ancient wisdom teachings; critical and cultural studies; and emergent neuroscience findings related to embodied mindfulness to uncover theoretical and evidence based models aimed at decreasing suffering for self and, in turn, other. We will investigate mindfulness in theory and practice; analyze deconstructionist, feminist, and scholarly texts; read medical and public health journals; and watch films and videos. Examining the incomprehensibility of the singular, social, and environmental crises we face, we will examine whether deeply held ideological self-identification is the root cause for much of our shared dis-ease. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Students will be encouraged to make brave connections across disciplines through written, oral, and artistic creation in order to foster critical thinking that occupies the in-between spaces of ambivalence and uneasiness so they may cultivate new arts-integrated toolsets for change. Running headfirst into the big issues facing our time, together we will question whether confronting suffering directly offers possibilities for transcendence here and now.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In short, this course encourages getting lost as a way to get found and asks, 'what kind of future-mindedness is necessary to succeed in our troubling times?' &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ORIGIN STORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We all construct our identities daily whether it's during introductions at a party or while writing an artist bio for a gallery. Sharing your background in a succinct, sincere, and engaging way to connect you to others. Beyond this surface, the experiences, people, and locations that have shaped you can and will continue to inform your voice as an artist. However, with any choice in the design process, critical thought needs to be applied. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Some artists choose to focus on origin stories while others occupy formal or conceptual realms. Regardless, of the thrust of the work, the artist's hand is always present. In this class we will explore our own origin stories while examining and questioning mid-career contemporary artists and theorists who address issues related to personal narrative in art. Sparked by an interest in stories centering on a hero's transformation through the adaptation of technology, students will research and explore models of origin stories while developing projects relating to their own history. Technology workshops will focus on a DIY approach to tool-making. Whether it is a masked crusader from popular culture, an Ancient Greek mariner, or former RISD alumni who have developed a grad thesis into an international community action think tank, this class will aim to equip the student with the tools to examine their origin story now and fold it into their artistic careers.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio course Blood in the Louvre, Butt in Vimeo explores dark humor within artistic context throughout history to understand its role and potential within artistic practice. In order to explore dark humor as an artistic methodology, we will start by questioning 'dark' imagination throughout history and the psychology behind it. The class will gain a deeper understanding of how dark humor has been used throughout history- from myths to memes; from the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch to the 'Hi Stranger' video. We will investigate how its usage varies between genres, traditions, time periods and cultures through class lectures, assigned readings, and guest speakers. The readings/viewing materials of broad range - from cognitive studies to contemporary web subculture; criminology studies to poems - will be provided for further discussion and exploration. The majority of this course will focus on multiple hands-on workshops such as material workshops and discomfort workshops, for further exploration related to the theme of this course. Students will present work regularly in class for critique. The work can take any form - students are encouraged to fold the topics and themes discussed in the course into their own practice. By the end of the course, students will be able to grasp the complex and changing symbology of elements of dark humor in relation to human experience, and comprehend their own place in that context in order to sharpen their critical capacity and sense of inquiry. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

Critical attention is given to code as a body of crafted text with significant aesthetic, philosophical, and social dimensions, as well as the tension, conflict, and potential possible when computation generates, informs, or interacts with drawings, materials, forms, and spaces. Historical and contemporary works of computational art and design will be presented and assigned for analysis. This course is open to students of all majors and is designed for those with little or no experience in programming. In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer. This course fulfills one of two core studio requirements for CTC Concentration.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt; Apply during registration period using the form found here: https://goo.gl/forms/oARSYmuhjYrNczVZ2 or go to ctc.risd.edu. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CTC: CONCENTRATION PROJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>CTC Concentration Project is a required, advanced course for all CTC Concentrators taken after a student has earned 12 CTC credits. In this course, students develop and complete a large scale project that draws from the students' prior studies in the CTC Concentration. Students write source code, author software, and program hardware for making their own works of art and design. Complementing this work, students engage in critical discourse surrounding computation, technology, and culture through dialogue and writing. Coding as a technology with implications for making and authorship is explored through a pedagogy of code sharing and collaborative learning. Differences in programming cultures across languages and disciplines is one of the motive forces in this course. Throughout the semester, seminar discussions are organized around canonical computational texts. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration Requirement; CTC Concentrators only.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITALIZATION, POSTHUMANISM AND THE BODY IN CRISIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course works from the premise that digital technology has produced a crisis of embodied experience. Today we live in various forms of augmented space, our three-dimensional space of experience is overlaid with additional algorithmic dimensions. Our engagement with technology, its interfaces and VR have changed the human relation to the world and to others. Various phenomena of contemporary culture suggest that the digital is causing a kind of puberty, a disconnectedness, a feeling of being out of tune with one's own body. We will address this crisis of embodiment from two perspectives: phenomenology and philosophical anthropology. Both fields have stressed the meaning of embodied and kinesthetic experience of space, shared attention, and face-to-face communication. After all, these interactions are the essence of what makes us human-are they threatened to be distorted? Posthumanist discourses respond by arguing that we should embrace technology as an ally to combat the destructive and exclusionary aspects of essentialist humanism-and champion the model of the cyborg body.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course presumes that epistemology and technology are crucially intertwined with questions of identity and the self. Topics include the cognitive function of flat surfaces, the non-humanist origins of the digital, and the perks of interface design; the transformation of face-to-face communication, cyber-feminism, and online cultures like 'otherkin'. The notion of the 'body in crisis' thereby implies a moment of decision: What is the future of the body?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To address this question, we will turn to selected readings. We will unpack these in lectures and through the discussion of numerous examples. A special focus is the transformative and reflective potentials of design and art in dealing with these issues. In two assignments, students are asked to digest the course materials and discussions directly through their studio practice and making.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as HPSS-S008; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Throughout the semester, a series of exercises addressing technical and theoretical issues provide students with the necessary experience to produce midterm and final projects. Coursework involves computational approaches to sound design and composition with instruction in the audio programming language Max and digital audio workstations, i.e. Reaper and Ableton Live. Students have recurring access to a 25-channel loudspeaker array for the development of works. Readings from psychology, philosophy, the arts, and sound studies support class discussions and critiques.   &lt;BR&gt; Students will need a laptop computer (Mac or, Windows) and a Max software license (educational, pricing available from cycling74.com). Previous experience with digital audio software recommended.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;br&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITALIZATION, POSTHUMANISM AND THE BODY IN CRISIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course works from the premise that digital technology has produced a crisis of embodied experience. Today we live in various forms of augmented space, our three-dimensional space of experience is overlaid with additional algorithmic dimensions. Our engagement with technology, its interfaces and VR have changed the human relation to the world and to others. Various phenomena of contemporary culture suggest that the digital is causing a kind of puberty, a disconnectedness, a feeling of being out of tune with one's own body. We will address this crisis of embodiment from two perspectives: phenomenology and philosophical anthropology. Both fields have stressed the meaning of embodied and kinesthetic experience of space, shared attention, and face-to-face communication. After all, these interactions are the essence of what makes us human-are they threatened to be distorted? Posthumanist discourses respond by arguing that we should embrace technology as an ally to combat the destructive and exclusionary aspects of essentialist humanism-and champion the model of the cyborg body.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course presumes that epistemology and technology are crucially intertwined with questions of identity and the self. Topics include the cognitive function of flat surfaces, the non-humanist origins of the digital, and the perks of interface design; the transformation of face-to-face communication, cyber-feminism, and online cultures like 'otherkin'. The notion of the 'body in crisis' thereby implies a moment of decision: What is the future of the body?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; To address this question, we will turn to selected readings. We will unpack these in lectures and through the discussion of numerous examples. A special focus is the transformative and reflective potentials of design and art in dealing with these issues. In two assignments, students are asked to digest the course materials and discussions directly through their studio practice and making.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2008 and HPSS-S008; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The goal of Independent Drawing Projects is for students to develop a distinct, carefully conceived, and self-directed body of works through a process of investigation, critical assessment and production. Through a rigorous studio practice, students are expected to identify and develop their own conceptual interests and material approaches.  Individual and group critiques support, facilitate, and intensify this process. While drawing concentrators will be given priority, interested students outside of the concentration and beyond the sophomore level may take this course. For the drawing concentrator, the work created for the Independent Drawing Project serves as the culmination of the Drawing Concentration program. Critiques will run from 6-9 pm, followed by independent studio work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Directing class, students are encouraged to go beyond the first instinct or idea, and to develop a project to its fullest potential, particularly with respect to meaning and to potential modes of execution. Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER ANIMATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR STUDIO: OPEN MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over the course of a year, senior students integrate their media skills through a cross-disciplinary approach with time-based media practice, resulting in a developed work or a series of smaller related works meant for exhibition or performance. This path is for students that wish to engage with time-based media in non-traditional ways, such as through installation, performance, public art, interactivity, intervention, networked/collaborative production, activism, etc.. Students research, develop, design, prototype, direct and produce these works independently. Students receive weekly individual guidance from the instructor and partnered peers. Class meetings are devoted to lectures, informational workshops, student presentations of related research, individual meetings and group critique.  During Wintersession, students perform production work, test and analyze parameters and results. Students have weekly meetings for lectures, guests, technical workshops, and weekly small-group meetings to discuss their works-in-progress. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to FAV majors only &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;Br&gt;  Registration by FAV Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What constitutes cinematic narrative, distinct from other forms of storytelling? How do we engage film form to tell a story, generate an idea or an emotion?   How can we alter a traditional narrative structure, and, what are the conceptual implications of these transformations? How can we use color to construct the subjective space of a character, or use sound to manipulate the temporal order of the story? Is there an ethics to a camera movement? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this advanced production workshop, we will explore cinematic narrative first by closely studying how a group of classical, experimental, and contemporary filmmakers have engaged narrative through filmic form. We will then formulate our own new cinematic narratives. Cinema is no longer restricted to the theater or the gallery. Moving images surround us online, on our phones and screens, in the streets, and in stores, taxis, and train stations.  We will consider the formal parameters of these new cinematic spaces and their possibilities. Coursework consists of the production of several short narrative films with film viewing, analysis and discussion as counterpoint. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 Deposit: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective  &lt;BR&gt;  Open to junior and senior FAV majors only  &lt;BR&gt;  Open to second-semester sophomore FAV majors and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMATION INTEGRATION/INSTALLATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio investigates the use of animation as an art form integrated into a cross-disciplinary practice using installation, performance and interactivity. This is different from traditional animation filmmaking in that students are instead exploring variations of the constructed cinematic object and the engagement of the human body as an active participant in the cinematic schema. The student uses the tenets of animation to consider the (de/re)construction of sequential image, identities of transmission and reception, the context of the projected image and light, the monitor as receptacle, motorized optical machines, environment and location. The course includes lectures, demonstrations, project workshops and studio practice. Emphasis is placed upon the conceptual, material, practical and creative approaches to reconsidering and re-making what animation is and can be. The course culminates with final projects. Prior animation experience is not necessary.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of Instructor Required. Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMATIC SPACE/VISUAL STORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course investigates the intersection between art direction, cinematography, staging and choreography, in other words, the "mise-en-scne" in live action projects. Students develop fiction or non-fiction live action projects that consider how every detail placed in front of the camera carries a meaning that can be used to advance and complicate the storytelling. The course introduces students how to create a distinct sense of place in their projects and to the semiotics of the frame/shot/movement in cinematography. Students learn to use the building blocks of visual storytelling (space, line, shape, tone, color, movement and rhythm) to amplify the story elements of plot, character and dialogue. By researching, filming and editing scenes from their individual and/or collaborative projects, students gain experience in production design, dcor, cinematography, and lighting, as well as location scouting and the research and development of look books and mood boards.  Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 Deposit: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to junior and above &lt;BR&gt; Registration by FAV Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction. In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques such as crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way throughout the entire process. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design and Textiles Departments, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as TEXT-2523; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The primary focus of the semester is an experimentally based investigation of bending and forming techniques - molded plywood, bent lamination, steam bending, and vacuum-formed plastic. While focused on the use of wood and plastic materials, an experimental approach is expected in the studio.  Students are encouraged to conceptually explore skills and materials to develop a personal design approach and studio practice.  The semester culminates in a final design, in which students utilize learned techniques to create one-offs, objects intended for batch production or prototypes designed for production. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Furniture Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design Department,  course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research elective class will focus on the myriad opportunities for the sustainable practice of design. The somewhat humbling point of departure is the fact that many, if not all, of the problems we currently face are the direct result of previous "design solutions". There are numerous topics to cover under each of the following domains. Our aim is to expose students to meaningful comprehensive and anticipatory sustainability thinking. The focus of the class will be on the development of a comprehensive, operationally useful "sustainability lens" through which to evaluate design decisions as they are being made in hopes of avoiding the Law of Unintended Consequences on the front end, rather than seeking to simply design without regard for the potentially negative outcomes that require fixing on the back end.    &lt;BR&gt; Material: The 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics, Material choice, material sourcing, life cycle analysis, the containment of entropy   &lt;BR&gt; Economic: Full Spectrum Accounting. Bring all externalities back onto the balance sheet   &lt;BR&gt; Life: Creating conditions conducive to life, Biomimetics: Learning from Nature not just about Nature. The preservation of biodiversity   &lt;BR&gt; Social: How does your object contribute to the quality of life for maker and user and other organisms, as well? Appropriate human behavior in the biosphere   &lt;BR&gt; Spiritual: An exploration of how students' work contributes to the "Great Work", embracing uncertainty and cultivating wonder  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Although today's global market continues to absorb these resources, Providence has retained a highly skilled manufacturing center that is eager to work with the creative arts. This rare resource provides designers the unique ability to work locally with manufacturing re-sources from traditional lost wax casting to emerging manufacturing technologies such as laser cutting, multi-axis cnc, and rapid prototyping. Throughout the course we will visit manufacturing, marketing, and retail facilities to develop a working understanding of production processes and methods available to you and how best to effectively implement these resources into your work as a designer/artist.  The studio course will conclude with each student presenting a finished production ready object in multiples along with supporting marketing materials. By approaching this class from a design, manufacturing, and marketing perspective students will acquire a practical knowledge of production strategies essential to the success of a designer today. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Lighting Kit Cost: $130.00 &lt;BR&gt; Elective for majors and non-majors &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSEDESC>Witness Tree Project Australia: Memory, Place and Cultural Ecology.  Exploring Cultural Ecology Through a Historic Lens.   &lt;br&gt; Partnering with University of South Australia, Adelaide, and Peter Walker, Program Director: Master of Design, School of Art, Architecture and Design, the Witness Tree Project will travel to Australia to explore the meaning of Cultural Ecology in Australia and how it has been practiced historically by both the Aboriginal and White Cultures. We will look at the different approaches to living in the environment of the Australian continent, how these different cultures have been shaped by the land and how they have interacted with each other.   &lt;br&gt; Using living Historic Trees as a focal point, in the Seminar component we will investigate historic events in both cultures that helped inform, shape and influence their given societies. In the Studio or field, using local materials, objects will be created in response to the research, writing and reading done in the seminar. 12-14 students from RISD and 12-14 students from UniSA will work together during this Winter Session Travel course.

   <COURSETITLE>PATTERNS OF THINKING: QUESTIONING OUR PREJUDICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What we believe and think effects what we are able to perceive, imagine and therefore create. Our patterns of thinking construct our understanding of the world. They determine what we believe and what we think is real and valuable. Understanding our ingrained patters of thinking is important because it determines not only what we perceive, but also what we are capable of perceiving and the manner in which we perceive it. This class will address the fundamental concepts that underlie issues of Social Equity and Inclusion (SEI). In this seminar course, students will be encouraged to critically explore their own assumptions and prejudice to cultivate flexibility in the development of their thought process and to embrace uncertainty in an effort to reach beyond current human cognitive limitations in dealing with the psychological and social manifestations that underpin societal inequality. There will be weekly reading and writing assignments, and a final essay chronicling the students' personal progress through the class. Instead of a final essay, students may choose to present a work of art or design that is indicative of their understanding of the course material. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AND/NEITHER: NON-BINARY OBJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will examine the in-between of categorization both as it pertains to personal identity and objects. The objective of this course is to identify and create objects that both talk about and embody hybridity and non-binary thinking. Students will challenge assumptions/defaults related to intersectional identities of race, gender, and sexuality as well as object identities of art, design, sculpture, and furniture. This interdisciplinary course welcomes object makers of all kinds working in a variety of mediums who wish to work between disciplines,  prefer "and" over "or," or want to eschew categories altogether. The introduction of some fundamental fabrication methods as well as training on the safe use of select Co-Works and Furniture Dept. machines will help students realize concepts in physical form. Presentations and readings will provide reference of historical and contemporary works/makers and inspire studio projects. Class time will consist of lectures, discussions, critiques, demos, studio time and one on one meetings. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIGHTWEIGHT STRUCTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Championed by utopian thinkers of the 20th century like Buckminster Fuller and Frei Otto, the idea of "doing more with less" has become ingrained in the development of new building systems. Design for vehicles, extreme environments, and sports have pushed the field of lightweight structures along, creating a vast array of new materials and building techniques. This course will examine lightweight structures through the lens of material research and exploration. Emphasis will be placed on developing assembly systems that are integral to the particular materials being explored. Topics introduced in this course will include but not be limited to tensile structures, space frames, pneumatic structures, tensegrity, frozen fabrics and the various form finding strategies associated with each. This course will also examine the various ways that this topic can be approached through both physical and digital model making. Computer modeling experience is preferred, but not required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; junior BFA.GLASS students &lt;BR&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of Department Head or Instructor required.

   <COURSEDESC>The exploration of material, body and movement is central to this class. Translating the movement of body and material between different mediums will inform class activities. Investigations will be played out through the use of hot glass, video and other materials. Focused readings and discussions will contextualize how working through and with the body is used in visual art and related disciplines like dance and theater. By enacting body and material new approaches to making will evolve. This class encompasses hands-on studio processes, video work, readings and active discussion.

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN OPTICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses. Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST AND THE MUSEUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will consider the various ways in which artists from Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell through Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Louise Lawler, Fred Wilson, Mark Dion, the Atlas Group, and Arlene Shechet have engaged aspects of the museum a subject matter of their work.  Either engaged in a critique of museum practices or romantic evocations of the past, manifold artists from the early twentieth century onward have addressed issues such as the staging devices that museums utilize to confer aura on works of art and natural history specimens or the makeup of their collections, classification systems, and behind the scenes storerooms and archives.   This interest will be linked to an ever expanding body of writing that has emerged in the past four decades given to the various historical narratives that museums and their archives project on their holdings.  Writers such as Sigmund Freud, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, Donna Haraway, Ralph Rugoff, and Susan Stewart will be considered among others.  The seminar will explore the tie-ins between these theoretical texts and artistic approaches with the outcome that students will gain a distinct understanding of this rich history and the variety of ongoing responses to the museum. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' and designers' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUBLIC ART: HISTORY, THEORY  AND PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course offers the opportunity to discover the creative and career possibilities in the growing interdisciplinary field of public art and public practice.  During the first half of the course, students research and present aspects of each weekly topic, including: pivotal events and artworks that formed the history of public art from the early 20th century to the present; individual artist's work and approaches to sitespecificity; current debates around defining the public, public space, and community; temporary vs. permanent work; controversies in public art; memorials, monuments, and anti-monuments; a case study of design team practice in a public/private development; public art administration models, among other topics.  During the second half, students work both individually and collaboratively on proposals and projects: a proposal for a memorial; proposals for a specific site in Providence; and temporary artworks sited in Providence. This is a collaborative course with Brown University's Program in Public Humanities. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENCOUNTERING THINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores the ways that objects and bodies come into contact with one another, asking how objects adorn, articulate, equip, augment, and constitute the person. In weekly readings and discussion, the class pairs theoretical, historical and critical theory perspectives that investigate subject-object relations. We begin by exploring the materiality and constitution of objects, examining how something is understood to be a commodity, waste, artifact, gift or magical thing. We examine the role objects play in the self-knowledge of persons (e.g. the use of objects to articulate social difference; the use of objects to materialize memory) and turn towards an examination of their role in mediating actions (e.g. the way objects discipline or constrain bodies; the ways they extend human capabilities).During a semester-long research project, students are invited to consider some important question related to their own studio and/or thesis work. We will talk about all stages of the research and writing process throughout the semester and with research librarians at the RISD library. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE GRADUAL CONTEMPORARY: CONVERSATIONS ON CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We tend to think of the contemporary in terms of speed and acceleration, but this class proposes a pause and a rewind. And that the contemporary has snuck up on us, gradually. We're not sure when it began.  Where. Why.  Or for whom. Perhaps the only point of consensus is that the studio is now embedded in the ideas that circulate around it. This class addresses contemporary art as a set of largely undecidable questions  - which, for better or worse, is also a definition of what philosophy is.  It therefore aims to provide graduate students with a historical and theoretical mooring in the key arguments and counter-arguments that currently shape contemporary art. Structured around a curated series of twelve invited guest lecturers, as well as class lectures and discussion, The Gradual Contemporary embraces a collaborative, multivocal form so as to showcase a range of competing perspectives, as well as to highlight the diverging viewpoints of museum directors, curators, magazine editors, critics, art historians and artists. Extended question and answer sessions  - the conversations part of the class  - will follow each lecture, giving students the chance to clarify their thoughts and test their differences, to query or challenge any or every part of the lecture.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - lecture &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MATERIALITY - WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF AND WHAT WE MAKE OF IT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;i&gt;It is . a political decision to focus on the materials of art; it means to consider the processes of making and their associated power relations, to consider the workers - whether they are in factories, studios or public spaces. and their tools of production.&lt;i&gt; - Petra  Lange Berndt, How to be Complicit with Materials  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is an interdisciplinary course about materiality. it is taught as both a seminar and a studio. We will explore the many materials we use as artists and consumers -- how they are formed, extracted, developed, circulated, and used, and how we think about them. We will look at the physical world through three lenses: science/production, theory, and art practice. These three approaches will run concurrently through the semester so that students will be simultaneously investigating, reading, and making work.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 1. Science/production: We will look at material science, learning about the chemical elements, and then about the most common materials that artists and designers use, from glass to concrete, metals to plastics, among many others. We will delve deep into the economic, environmental, and social impact of their use. We will study fabrication techniques. We will explore excess, waste, and recycling, visiting a waste facility.  &lt;br&gt; 2. Theory: There will be readings from a wide range of disciplines: theory, science, economics, and literature, as these disciplines touch on the study of materials in relation to art practice.  &lt;br&gt; 3. Practice: We will have two ongoing projects. One foregrounds materiality; the second foregrounds process and production. For the first work, you will make a work that is primarily about its own materials. For the second project, you will create a work of art that holds the history of its own making. We will look at precedents for both approaches in art of the 20th and 21st century.  &lt;br&gt; There will be readings,films and videos, guest speakers,  presentations by participants, course resources, and trips.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS' WRITINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will explore the various ways artists from the post-World War II onward have written about their work. By examining statements, journals, notebooks, interviews, diaries, poems, manifestos, essays, critical texts, and tweets by a variety of artists spanning Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman and Helen Frankenthaler through to Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Eva Hesse, as well as recent figures such as Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker, Fred Wilson, the Critical Art Ensemble and Julie Mehretu, the differing genres that artists' have used to describe their work will begin to emerge. Specific consideration will be given to the ways in which these literary forms structure the content and meanings of each artists' work. The course is constructed around in-class discussion of assigned texts, film and television interviews of artists, PowerPoint presentations, and visits to each student's studio. This seminar aims to extend the range of texts currently read by students, additionally serving as a springboard for the development of the graduate thesis within many of these literary strategies are pursued.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Lighting and upholstery techniques, as well as outside vendor protocols, may also be employed pursuant to the graduate student's design needs. Graduate students will develop a multi-lateral skill set applicable to their area of study. Thesis concepts are often explored within this class. Students concentrate, in sequence, six weeks of Studio Based Learning of techniques and skills followed by six weeks of dedicated, full scale, designed and executed piece. Located in the Center for Integrated Technologies, CIT Bldg, the Graduate Studies Wood Studio will focus on contemporary and traditional: joinery, shaping, and vacuum lamination construction techniques. In addition, metal (cold working) techniques and manipulation are also covered. Surface treatments and finishing methods for metal and wood will be covered throughout this class. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVESTIGATIONS: BETWIXT &amp; BETWEEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The unknown gap of the 'betwixt and between' is a space of great curiosity and charge.  It is a space that has captured the imagination of many artists, designers and writers throughout time. The main interest in this course is to investigate the nature of this space, how it is experienced, understood and given meaning from multiple viewpoints in art, design and literature, and ways in which it can become a space of significance for our practice as artists and designers.  As background to our own research, we examine features of the betwixt and between as it is evoked in the writings of the pre-Socratic thinkers, the theories of anthropologist Victor Turner, the lectures of composer John Cage, William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin's book titled The Third Mind, and philosopher Gaston Bachelard's view of spatial poetics.  Artists also walk us to that space, as is the case with Eva Hesse's threshold Works on Paper, Anselm Kiefer's preoccupation with ambivalence, and Anish Kapoor's sublime voids.  Most important, we will make and write as a way to see and understand the various forms and ways the betwixt and between presents itself in our own work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ALGORITHMIC LENS: THE IMAGE IN THE AGE OF COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The digital image has augmented our ability to capture, manipulate and share images. Now, new processes have transformed digital images into complex systems of choices, made by image makers, software developers, and corporations. These new lenses offer new possibilities for artists but can also create new dangers for society: engendering distrust, encoding bias and expanding surveillance. This course brings a critical eye to these algorithms. We will look at new possibilities such as immersive images, deep learning and computer vision from a cultural and artistic perspective. Through technical demonstrations, course discussion and critiques we will explore how these new possibilities affect our society and our own practice. Writer James Bridle has suggested "Machines are reaching further into their own imaginary spaces, to places we cannot follow." In this course we will attempt just that. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GENERATIVE SYSTEMS AND CHANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Every art practice is a series of decisions. What happens when those decisions are executed as a script of code? How does an artist's sense of value shift when a hundred images are as easy to produce as one image? As pressure grows on creatives of all fields to "generate content" we can look to contemporary procedural generation models in video games as well as the history of generative systems in art and design to challenge the limits of quick and unique production models. Students will create new works through workshops on chance and generative systems. We will study contemporary forms of generative systems, such as procedural generation in games, as well as the rich history of generative systems in art and design, to reconfigure their language and goals for in-class workshops that emphasize physical production. Assignments are flexible and previous coding experience is not necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIODESIGN STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course aims to create sufficient awareness of what yields life on earth, and a complementary biocentric view of the world. New ethical and critical challenges are continually presented to human society with the growth of material science and its implications for design; the course introduces sources and research references to assist with our understanding of these challenges. We explore aspects of human knowledge of living systems, providing a research-based approach to such topics as BioDesign; biomimicry in materials, processes, and structures; functional morphology and the cognitive phenomena of Biophilia. The 'affinities and aversions' we as humans have regarding natural living systems are in everything: from the spaces we inhabit to the metaphors we employ in order to understand complexity in general, including issues connected with health, recuperation and resilience. Using the recently extended facilities and resources of the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab, faculty and graduate students together create opportunities to experiment, observe, and learn about the networked aspects of living systems, materials, structures and processes. Theoretical frameworks associated with the biology of living systems, the growth and formation of natural materials including the contemporary revolutions in evolutionary theory are introduced and examples discussed with visiting specialists. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - studio&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERSPECIES COLLABORATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, our design and art process will move beyond biomimicry and become a space for Interspecies Collaboration among humans, non-human species, algorithms, and speculative lifeforms. By using artistic and scientific methods, we will investigate how living organisms, systems, processes, and related technologies can inspire, inform, and become modes of aesthetic discourse in this posthuman epoch. By introducing non-human perspectives as an active part of artistic knowledge production, we will explore worlds beyond human perception that occur on macro, micro and quantum scales. We will work towards post-anthropocentric modes of making that move beyond human language. This will involve fascinating mechanisms like quorum sensing and algorithmic code to create cross-species communication and collaboration platforms, propagating plants and hydroponic systems, breeding live insects, cultivating bacteria and fungi, and exploring bioluminescence alongside technologies such as microscopy, 3D printing, and various other digital fabrication techniques. We will rethink fixed human notions of gender and sexuality by learning about sequential hermaphroditism among animals and plants, open up possibilities for transgression of our current condition, whereby new modes of being and existence may be envisioned. We will introduce DNA as an artistic medium and incorporate the revolutionary fields of biotechnology and genetics into the art and design vernacular by learning the basics of DNA extraction, and other laboratory techniques in the context of art/design. Throughout the course, we will survey the contemporary developments in the fields of Art, Design, Science, and Philosophy by investigating Bioart, Biodesign, Posthuman Aesthetics, Object Oriented Ontologies, Speculative Design, Design Fictions &amp; Non-Human Perspectives and develop both conceptual and formal frameworks that will be explored through research and a series of interdisciplinary projects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICISM IN THE AGE OF AI</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> Criticism in the Age of AI will explore our culture's urgent need for a hybrid, strategic, and dissident criticism of technology, one that can engage with its underlying ideology and aim to concentrate power for a hyper-elite. As artists, designers, engineers, and programmers all prepare to enter technologically-driven fields, how will we remain critical, especially when the design of software and interfaces, AI, machine learning, data aggregation - and most computational architecture - actively obscures, even disappears its own motives? Traditional criticism developed in a strictly humanist rubric can't accurately describe intelligent systems that teach themselves our values, our needs, our emotional and aesthetic preferences. To be critical in the age of AI, we must engage with emerging, poorly understood technologies on their own terms. We will explore a wide range of rhetorical and philosophical tools found within experimental poetry, games and simulation design, sociology, and philosophy. As a class we will collectively develop and foster critical language to describe dominant systems that intervene in our seeing, language, our thinking, and our futures. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of "humanitarian help" across the world. Yet as form-givers, they not only make physical objects, but also shape our understanding of the problem at hand. This power to represent demands that they should not only be technically proficient, but also be able to think about the ethics of intervention. Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions or aesthetic coverings, leaving larger political and ideologic discussions for other disciplines? Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself? This course asks these hard questions and unpacks them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study. This is not a "how-to" course. We will approach ethics as a reflective friction in our work and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use. Course material includes mind-opening historical studies, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How can we turn mistakes into ideas? How can we successfully screw up? This seminar course - FAILED IT! - is dedicated to the art of making mistakes. We will consider and debate these and other questions. We will define individually and as a group what we mean we say something is a failure. We will look at theorists, and writers, and contemporary artists from various arts disciplines who have had the courage to fail and through their mistakes have made something unique. We will consider how what we as artists consider as failings can be early indicators of success. We will explore what it means to reject the safe and the expected in favor of the exciting and the unknown. We will investigate the thinking and processes behind those who have embraced imperfections and rule-breaking, to discover and learn that wrong can be right, bad can be good, and that originality cannot always be planned or predicted. Learning will happen through exercises in-class, readings, journal writing, experimental making, film screenings, group discussions and other activities. The course will use the book 'FAILED IT!' by international artist and curator Erik Kessels as its foundation [used with permission]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course helps prepare graduate students to be effective educators while fostering a community of shared ideas while teaching at RISD. Designed to support graduate students while they are teaching in RISD's Wintersession, the course is a practicum in which participants discuss practical and theoretical concerns related to collegiate teaching and learning. As a forum, the course provides a space for group reflection on teaching experiences and challenges in addition to developing effective learning and assessment strategies. Through structured feedback from faculty, students evaluate their teaching effectiveness and document their development as teacher- scholars through refining, expanding and updating the teaching portfolio. In an immersive teaching and learning experience, graduate students will have an opportunity to share and apply knowledge of diverse learning styles and methods, and an awareness of how social identities produce systemic hierarchies in the classroom to their own discipline-focused art and design instruction. Each participant is required to be teaching or co-teaching a Wintersession course.    &lt;BR&gt; Each participant is required to be teaching or co-teaching a concurrent Wintersession course.  &lt;Br&gt; Partial requirement for Certificate in Collegiate Teaching in Art + Design Conferred with Teaching Experience.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio course offers students the opportunity to design with color in a variety of media, while researching and studying color in use (in existing works of art, design, film, and architecture). Students are offered several projects to choose from. Each is designed to bring awareness about the role color plays in different areas, through analysis and interpretation of how color works in terms of optics, communication, metaphor, and visual stimuli. Topics considered include observing color in film, color as narrative device, color and light, color in fine art applications, and color in communication design. Students will also explore the similarities and differences of color palettes as used by artists and designers, and through the creation of several design projects, students will develop a sense of confidence and appropriateness when working with color.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Film and graphic design share an omnivorousness that devours all other media, and achieving mastery in either can fill a lifetime. Not coincidentally, similar questions are central to both forms: the careful deployment and control of image, color, text, tone, pacing, editing, communication, history, taste. the list of overlaps is long. &lt;BR&gt; Through a series of small exercises and short readings, culminating in a self-initiated multi-week project, this class seeks to offer a route into exploratory filmmaking that builds on the training and knowledge of a graphic designer. Skills will be learned through demonstrations and collaborative problem solving. The presumption is that projects will be executed in a film format, but this is not a requirement. Emphasis will be on finding a way to address problem solving in an unfamiliar time-based medium in a way that works for you. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors. only &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This elective is an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the process of designing a typeface; to consider all the design decisions that are a part of this creative exercise, and to learn the finer points of bzier wrangling, serif and sans, spacing, kerning, and all the other details of execution which turn a roughly-formed idea into a more complete, rigorous and polished type design. This course will provide a fundamental understanding of how typefaces work in addition to accessing a new design tool that can find practical use.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERACTIVE TEXT: INTERACTIVE SOUND AND IMAGE EMPHASIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Presented as fine art practice, this course will introduce the student to narrative and non-narrative experimentation with language in digital space. &lt;BR&gt;  During the course students will be given a number of short term assignments which will serve as explorations of common themes. Students will also propose a longer term investigation, that will develop in the form of a semester long project. &lt;BR&gt; We will explore both analog and digital technologies to develop the concepts presented during the semester, utilizing Final Cut, After Effects, Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Ableton Live and/or other programs for the production of texts. The course will have an interactive sound and image emphasis. Students will experiment with interactive text, visuals, and audio composition in the digital realm, placing emphasis on the effect and meaning transformation that occurs when texts are combined with visuals and audio material. &lt;BR&gt; The course will balance conceptual concerns related to content and structuring methodologies with artistic expression. Specific Aesthetic histories will be explored tracing the use of text in artistic practice including Concrete Poetry, the texts of Kurt Schwitters, Russian Constructivist posters, Fluxus poetic works, the Dada and Surrealist Word/Image, Magritte, Jenny Holtzer, Ed Ruscha, Barbara Kruger as well as other contemporary practitioners. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REFRAMING THE POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The poster has been an archetypal graphic design format since the late 19th century when lithographic printing technology came of age and captured the imagination of artists, bringing their vision into Paris streets. This course will invite you to explore future possibilities and contexts for the poster-as paper and as screen-building on its singular capacity to transform ideas into iconic picture planes; and examining the dynamics of typography and image, both still and in motion. Prompts will progress from individual posters, to sequences, to site-specific installations that explore the potential for interactive discourse in public space. Studio assignments will be supported with presentations and readings about poster history and contemporary poster design.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors and Brown students with Instructor permission. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY III</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Typography III is the culmination of RISD's typography sequence, with an emphasis on typography and contemporary display platforms. Advances in software and hardware have created new opportunities for how language is written, sequenced and accessed. Projects in this semester depend on altered states, where the content, composition, and context all are potentially at play. Students will continue to develop proficiency in designing for static compositions while extending the meaning and voice of that work across multiple platforms. Students will have ample opportunity to further shape their perspective and individual voice in relation to contemporary typography.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 3</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students are expected to develop personal working methods and interests through more general questions posed by the faculty. Longer-term projects will be intermixed with shorter projects posed by visiting critics. Students should complete the Design Studio track with a developed sense of self, and able to start framing questions and lines of inquiries of their own. End forms will be more emphasized than in Design Studio 1 and 2, in part as evidence that craft and working methods are sufficiently evolved. The twice-a-week format is intended for juniors or advanced designers who have completed the first two semesters of Design Studio or an equivalent "design principles" track. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRAPHIC DESIGN FOR THE WEB</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the possibilities of design online from a conceptual, historical, and programmatic perspective. The class celebrates the Internet as a space for social exchange and independent expression, while questioning the cultural contradictions embedded in online discourse and the motivations of individuals and entities behind online platforms. Through projects, readings, workshops, and presentations we will explore the relevance of network technologies in the context of contemporary art and design practices. Students will learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with methods for conceptualizing, designing, and developing websites. Outcomes won't necessary be practical, nor pragmatically functional. Instead we will strive for a poetic understanding of design and the Internet as mediums for critical research and action. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on advanced composition in Graphic Design and Typography using an array of materials, techniques and formats. Form remains an area of study in graphic design that does not need an application, only a surface. Emphasis will be placed on experimental form-making/image-making using generative and iterative approaches. Form need not follow function. Studio assignments are supported by lectures showing contemporary graphic form, from historical to contemporary work, that are effective and evocative. This elective aims to build a collection of work that can be shared with the larger graphic design community. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;br&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLOR + SURFACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Color is a phenomenon of light and pigment and is an expressive and symbolic component of art and design. Color exists in myriad forms: as ink on paper, as pixels on computers, paint on canvas, as light on screens, and reflected off surfaces of objects both natural and man-made. Through a series of exercises and assignments, students in this class will explore the power of color-seeing color in action as well as examining and creating color relationships and operations. Students will rotate through two faculty for six weeks each, and in doing so, explore how designers utilize color and how color gets applied to surfaces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will develop a general understanding of color theory and applied color through observation and articulation. These techniques and skills will serve as a complement to your other required core courses. A blend of lectures, demonstrations, studio exercises, assignments, and critiques, will allow students to observe, articulate, analyze, and practice the use of color.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 2</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE &amp; IMAGE IN MOTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We stand firmly planted in a visual world, surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors and more-as large as towering billboards and as small as compact cell phones. Such images provide us with clues about our environment, feeding our mind with information that we find useful for survival or for orientation purposes. But these very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us from discerning what is truly important. How do we tell them apart? The primary goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to create meaningful and intelligent images. Course content is tailored for three levels of experience - introductory, intermediate and advanced. Some of the class projects include documentary photography, film title design and music video. The works of Saul Bass, Bill Viola and Michel Gondry will be used as the "textbooks" for this course. Readings, film screenings and listening exercises accompany studio work. Some knowledge of Adobe Flash or After Effects or Final Cut Pro would be helpful but is not required.

   <COURSEDESC>Students are expected to develop personal working methods and interests through more general questions posed by the faculty. Longer-term projects will be intermixed with shorter projects posed by visiting critics. Students should complete the Design Studio track with a developed sense of self, and able to start framing questions and lines of inquiries of their own. End forms will be more emphasized than in Design Studio 1 and 2, in part as evidence that craft and working methods are sufficiently evolved. The twice-a-week format is intended for juniors or advanced designers who have completed the first two semesters of Design Studio or an equivalent "design principles" track. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course is based on the premise that the narrative shaping of information is fundamental to human communication. As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING INFORMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE VISITING DESIGNERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This graduate-only Visiting Designers course provides contact with the visiting designers in four intensive workshops over the 12-week semester. The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-majors pending seat availability. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will cover all aspects of designing comprehensive art and photographic books. We will examine the use of type in layouts, editing images, grids, scale, and pacing. Particular attention will be paid to certain elements of design production, including the visual, tactile, and aesthetic qualities of paper, printing, binding, color separation, and advanced techniques in reproduction, namely duotone and three-tone in black and white photography. In the first part of the semester students will design the layout and the corresponding dust jacket for a photographic book. The material will include a number of original black and white photographs from one of the very well known French photographers. In the second part of the semester, students will be given the choice between designing a book based on their own interests and completing a book design project using assigned material. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE TYPOGRAPHY STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement for first-year graduate students in the three-year program; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As technologies advance, the integration of the physical and digital becomes more common. Screens are integrated into space, objects gain intelligence, places respond to us, and Experiential Design (XD) offers a design approach to the development of new ways to use these opportunities as platforms and tools. XD is the practice of creating interactive spaces which orient, inform, educate, or delight an audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course is designed for participants schooled in graphic design and attentive to contemporary technologies. Building upon that knowledge, this course will prime students to design and orchestrate spatially located interventions. Workshopping will provide hands on experience in rapid prototyping; resulting skills will then be applied in independent projects. Project prompts will allow for a range of subject matter. Scale of projects will range from hand-held to inhabitable, favoring human scale. Project content will range from complete narratives to crowd authored content. Project completion will range from prototypes to proposals, from full scale segment install to final installations. Course content will include exposure to a range of technologies while assignments will be medium agnostic. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $240.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This may be an interest or activity not offered in other courses, a personal ideal, a unique circumstance, a collaboration of two or more individuals, the preliminary work for the Degree Project, or to supplement Graduate Thesis work, etc. The work can involve a broad range of curiosities like sustainability, sociocultural activism, public service, criticism, spirituality; the nature of theory; practice and experiment; methodology; technology; interactivity. While similar to an ISP or CSP this course differs in its objectives to also offer a dynamic learning experience: 1) to meet as a class (and in small groups and privately) to facilitate interaction and share work and ideas; 2) to discuss topics of interest and relevance to the group; 3) to stimulate interdisciplinary and inter-level interaction among students (all levels and non-majors are welcome!) &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NEWLY FORMED</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on advanced composition in Graphic Design and Typography using an array of materials, techniques and formats. Form remains an area of study in graphic design that does not need an application, only a surface. Emphasis will be placed on experimental form-making/image-making using generative and iterative approaches. Form need not follow function. Studio assignments are supported by lectures showing contemporary graphic form, from historical to contemporary work, that are effective and evocative. This elective aims to build a collection of work that can be shared with the larger graphic design community. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;br&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPUTER UTOPIAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The goal of this studio is to reimagine the personal computer. &lt;BR&gt;  Three decades ago, the Macintosh dropped a sci-fi bomb on pop culture. It advertised a utopic vision of human-computer creativity to mass audiences. By remixing military-industrial-academic fragments, a product company sold the dream of new humanism. This decade, the planet is bursting with smartphones; billions of people will carry globally-networked pocket computers, each outfitted with sensors that datify the material world. We now have quantities, rates, and kinds of data unlike anything humankind has ever seen. Individual biological minds can't reason at network scale, so we're teaching fields of computers to do it instead.  &lt;BR&gt; If the data center is today's mainframe, is there a Macintosh hiding in the next decade? If your phone's camera is the next mouse, what will it click on? As machine learning reinvents humanism, what are 21st century creative tools? What do network literacy and 21st century citizenship look like? Is the programmer/user dichotomy destroyable? How much of this is just a design problem? &lt;BR&gt; We'll explore these topics with studio work and seminar-style discussion. Studio work will include creation of mockups, videos, webmedia, interaction design, and beyond. Prototypes and design fictions are welcome. Programming experience is not explicitly required. Sincere eagerness to rigorously engage and reorient computer culture is a must. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic design majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Calligraphy is a demanding and exacting discipline, which rewards the artist with letter-making freedom and self-expression.  &lt;BR&gt; This workshop is intended as a starting point and a practical how-to-do-it course in lettering as a means of training the hand, the eye, and the mind in a perennially useful and foundational art. It will have the purpose of inspiring the graphic designer to work at making beautiful letters, understand the origins of type, and approach page arrangements from a lettering perspective. Students will use broad-edged/square-cut tools to learn the fundamentals of proportion, shape, spacing and layout.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be a focus on the work of the humanist scribes of the Renaissance, whose writing styles led to some of the most beautiful italics ever developed-clear, elegant forms which provide a wonderful model for modern handwriting-the most universal of the arts, a way that we all make marks on paper. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only &lt;br&gt;Open to sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop will serve as an introduction to motion graphics: an increasingly essential addition to the graphic design toolkit. We will jump right into developing a professional workflow for After Effects, plus learning how it works in unison with programs like Illustrator and Photoshop. Through a series of in-class demos, quick motion sketches, and a larger scale project, students will acquire and understand various techniques to animate. This workshop will also touch on principles of graphic design and typography, especially the many ways motion can be used to elevate them. In addition, students will learn to observe and pay attention to details, understand how timing and pacing work in storytelling, and potentially open a door for further inquiry into motion graphics as an integral part to their artistic practice. (No prior experience with After Effects required, must be proficient in Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.)  &lt;br&gt; [Note: Class preferably takes place at a computer lab to ensure everyone has access to the program, doesn't have to worry about charging their laptops and a full keyboard with numeric pad.] &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROGRAMMING FOUNDATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The first goal of the course is to nurture foundations in programmatic thinking. You'll learn to code. You will develop agility with fundamental programmatic primitives like: functions, loops, variables, conditional logic, recursion, &amp; data structures. We'll journey across a number of programming paradigms and techniques: imperative, declarative, objects &amp; messaging, functional &amp; code-as-data, asynchronous &amp; event-driven, etc. You'll make realtime multiplayer software via websockets, and query popular network services by learning http &amp; REST basics. Begin to gain a programmer's command of your own machine, understanding the terminal and command line tools. Our targets will be the browser and node.js, so we'll work in Javascript and languages with a good WASM story. &lt;br&gt; The second goal of the class is to destroy computation. Come to question everything in the course. Wonder if code is the best instrument for composing computer media. Recognize a drastic literacy asymmetry in the world. Melt cosmopolitan veneer. See the hazards of "UI/UX" culture, hazards of how civilization currently regards computation. Consider how client-server relates to governance &amp; truth, and how utopian rhetorics of decentralization could summon new kinds of problems for society. Understand machine-learning as painting. What are new software attitudes? How do we incubate new voices in computation? &lt;br&gt; No background with code required.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;br&gt; Fine artists strongly encouraged. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class foregrounds tactility-the sense most unique to printed objects. The course covers advanced concepts in use of color, form, layout and pagination to create more intimately produced printed objects. Projects will be student-driven, resulting in a range of hand-produced zines, posters, booklets, posters, prints, paper sculptures, masks and other concrete forms. Readings, contemporary issues and class discussions will spark themes that encourage students to generate their own content that finds its form into small editioned works. This course will encourage experimentation, collaboration and visual storytelling. Students will be given an overview of Risograph printing.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN IN THE POSTHUMAN AGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The current understanding of what constitutes design is straining at the margins of convention. The reach of design has moved beyond the materiality of objects, to biotechnological matter of chemicals and encoded genetic information, from physical space to code and data. Human beings now live lives that are immersed in design. The designer and their subject share a dialectical relationship, constantly shaping and reshaping each other. The role of the designer, thriving in the world of post-industrial and digital technologies, is thus broader today than ever before-from designing brands and creating personalities, to contriving and manipulating living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Post-postmodernism, pseudo-modernism, supermodernism, digimodernism, are only a few of the many terms trying to describe our current state. Today, we occupy the digital domain as thoroughly as we do physical space. Codes and algorithms have also become signifiers of a new biotechnological paradigm shift, marking the passage into a posthuman epoch by launching us into a virtual space composed of a bright galaxy of screens and digital worlds, creating a symbiotic relationship between our technology and biological selves. As designers, we shape, clash, align, and distort this new space, elaborating a stage for the New Man and the New Woman, and perhaps even the Nonhuman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this class, we will explore our contemporary condition through visual-research based projects around self-design, speculative design and design fiction. We will use graphic design as a medium to ask questions about ethical concerns emerging from advancements in science and technology. We will develop a new design vernacular incorporating ideas from revolutionary recent developments in genetics, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. We will employ machine vision: microscopy, neuroimaging and NASA archives to create new fictional worlds in concert with the life forms around and inside us. This engagement with the sciences will allow us as graphic designers to acquire some fundamental tools that probe fundamental human nature, and help us navigate the posthuman epoch that lies ahead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above. &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Two technologies more than 500 years apart will inspire the students in finding either harmony or discord. Neither is proven wrong.   Students will be introduced to the Type Shop through the techniques and procedures for setting and printing metal and wood type on the Vandercook proofing presses. Engaging in this historic craft, newly developed skills will be transformed into contemporary results. The students will unite the digital with the analog technology, for example by feeding a letterpress print through the inkjet plotter or to digitize hot metal type. The options are endless. Specifications on paper selection will be discussed and samples of letterpressed books will be shown for inspiration.

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores generative processes with emphasis on visual systems by rethinking the tools and software used to produce and distribute graphic design. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Design approaches from Google Material Design, previous MIT media lab's branding identity, and variable fonts, show how designer's role becomes more about creating iterations based on modules, algorithms, and datasets. As these components are built for reuse, it is easy to create iterations without much design intent. In this class, we will investigate how designers can take this environment as a creative condition and explore various form-making methodologies to evoke its meaning and context.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Knowledge in basic html/css/javascript is useful. Specific techniques on prototyping tools including Processing, p5.js, and other web programming languages will be provided throughout the course to strengthen students' skill. Weekly student-led presentations and reading discussions will cover relevant topics. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL ISSUES STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this combined seminar/studio-format course, we'll take a wide-ranging look at the most urgent critical conversations in the field of graphic design today, and engage those conversations through visual work. Through a weekly program of readings and discussions, we'll explore what contemporary designers and thinkers are saying about graphic design's relationship to structures of political and economic power, to style and taste, to identity politics, to cultural institutions, to technology, to 'wicked problems,' and to design's own intellectual and aesthetic history. We'll engage these conversations through a series of small experimental studio projects that interpret, question, and extend ideas from the readings. These experiments will lead into a final project in which each member of the class will deeply engage-through research, curation, and design-a critical issue of their choice. Collectively, our work in this class will model a design practice that engages its context in a rigorous and sophisticated way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POINT, CLICK, DRAG: DESIGNING THE DIGITAL INTERFACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital user experiences are a part of our everyday lives, shaping our realities and taking us to new levels of productivity and connectedness.     In this hands-on studio, students will explore how designers create digital services and products that are easy to use and solve real-world problems. In two initial projects, one independent and one group-based, students will develop interaction design skills such as research, concept development, interface sketching, interactive prototyping, and user testing. For the third and final project, students will choose to work independently or in groups to develop a digital service or product of their choosing. This project will culminate in the final presentation of a "looks-like" interactive prototype and a video that illustrates the intended user experience. By the end of the course, students will have the skills needed to bring web, mobile, and ubiquitous digital user experiences from concept to reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores typography within the browser, considering the web not as a container but as a medium. Students will develop typographic systems that activate the capacities and conditions specific to websites and how typographic voices evolve through the axis of use. We will begin locally by responding to different device environments, then expand to understanding the network as material. Discussions will examine how publishing on the internet entails distinct forms of typographic engagement from the "user" and the implications behind designing an "experience." Technical instruction will include basic web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as incorporate type design tools to introduce variable font technology. Background in coding is recommended but not required.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors with permission of the Department. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MACHINE LEARNING AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We're a fifth of our way through the 21st century, and today's general purpose technologies are evident. Machine learning systems have become invisible norms prototyping algorithmic experiences for us (Facebook Newsfeed), redirecting our behaviors towards corporate interests (Alexa), and reimagining our bodies and minds inside a field of limitless automation (Amazon Marketplace). As we're being conditioned by these systems, designers urgently need to develop literacies and the tools to prototype, redirect, and reimagine back. The goal of this course is to empower you to build these literacies and envision these tools. One part speculative design lab and one part critical research group, this course will convene multiple viewpoints on the machine learning infrastructure shaping our generations' lived experiences. Our studio projects will involve mapping, prototyping with, speculating against, exploring, exploiting, and extrapolating forward from machine learning systems. Student-led discussions, some reading, and short lectures will support our studio work, helping us analyze existing and deployed systems, demystifying how they operate and situating them in their emerging historical contexts. This is a research course that operates from first principles. No technical experience with programming or machine learning is required, nor will projects assume a technical skill set: those new to programming and machine learning are encouraged to enroll. Students are expected to bring a desire to dissect and reimagine complex systems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors with permission of the Department. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE FOURTH ESTATE: MASS MEDIA POLITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As Agenda Setting Theory states, "[t]he press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about." (Cohen, 1963). The press plays an important role in any democracy, and in the case of the United States, it also has a special place in public life, one guaranteed in the constitution by the first amendment. However, in recent times the media has contributed to a polarization of political attitudes by framing stories through an ideologically-driven lens. This has become evident in public opinion polls, and at the ballot box. This course will introduce students to the complex process through which politicians use media to get elected, stay in office, and achieve policy goals. Additionally, we will examine the role that the media plays as the fourth estate, by informing the citizenry on the issues that are crucial to government and the sociopolitical process. Through varied in-class exercises and case studies, students will learn to analyze and assess the trustworthiness and veracity of news outlets.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of the modern Middle East (1800-present) and is designed to help students contextualize and understand political, economic, and social developments in the contemporary Middle East.  Composed of a mix of lectures and discussions, this course begins with a series of foundational lectures on important events and themes in Middle Eastern history prior to 1800 (such as the emergence of three monotheistic religions in the Middle East - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the rise, formation, and expansion of Islamic States in the early-modern period such as the Ottoman and Safavid/Persian Empires).  Moving quickly into the modern period, this course focuses in equal measure on the Arab Middle East, Iran, and Turkey.  The historical roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict are also addressed.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CLIMATE FUTURES, TRANSITIONS AND THE GREEN NEW DEAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Climate Futures, Transitions and the Green New Deal is a course that starts from the proposition that the consensus position on the climate crisis, as summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, provides a robust scientific basis for thinking about the challenge of deep decarbonization and adaption to life on a warmer planet. The course provides a survey and evaluation of the social science of the post-carbon transition. The course is grounded in environmental sociology and critical design studies, but the social science of the post-carbon transition is necessarily inter- and cross-disciplinary. As such, students will be encouraged to draw from broader historical, scientific and policy literatures in energy policy and urban studies, climate science, political ecology, public policy,agro-food studies and beyond to grapple with the challenge of societal transition. We will critically interrogate the merits of green neoliberal, feminist, Green New Deal and post colonial/post-capitalist proposals for post-carbon futures. We will debate the future of manufacturing, technological innovation, employment, urbanization, and food cultivation in a carbon constrained world. The course will also consider how different visions of transition might contain and enact very different political and ethical assumptions, and open or foreclose very different power relations.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This introductory course provides a broad overview of the major content areas within the field of psychology (e.g., physiological, developmental, social and cognitive psychology) and will introduce you to the psychological theories and research used to understand human behavior. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including how people learn, process and store information, why people possess distinct personalities, how social situations and cultural norms affect our behavior, how we grow and develop throughout our lives, etc.  Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the merit of classic psychological theory and research in understanding people's thoughts, feelings and actions in real world situations. This course will provide a broad knowledge base for those interested in taking upper level psychology classes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and juniors. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Socrates described philosophy as an intellectual preparation for death.  He recognized that how we react to, think about, and cope with finality tells us a great deal of what we think about the core of our existence.  Philosophers have been divided between a "bald scenario" that death is nothing but the end of our material existence to which we are limited, and the more reassuring view that death is a door to another personal plane of existence.  Death is nothing vs. death is everything.  We will examine these phenomena from philosophical points of view through reflection primarily on philosophical works but will include religious sources and literary works.  While philosophers have primarily focused understandably on the individual confronting death, we will constantly place these questions and their answers within interpersonal and social spheres of consideration.  We will focus on: What is Death? The role of death in the meaning of life; personal survival in various scenarios; ethical issues surrounding suicide, euthanasia, and other voluntary ending of life.  We will look at a few of the social practices surrounding death and examine their meaning and functionality. Intensive reading, writing, and participation in seminar format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Using the lens of environments where we live, work and play, we will examine the everyday experience of different types of places including the home, institutional settings, public space, and play spaces. Attention will be placed upon social and spatial inequalities, local and global relations, and intersections of race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and power. We will explore psychological questions of perception, place identity, culture, place attachment, cognition, and the meaning of spaces through readings, film, visual exercises, and environmental analysis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GENDER &amp; THE MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Representations of gender across media forms (in film, television, music, print media, and advertisements) serve to inform us about the gendered system in which we live.  In addition to serving as a reflection of a given society's traditional gender roles and norms, mainstream media forms shape binary notions of gender by actively promoting specific gender stereotypes and ideals for men and women.  Considering media as an economic and capitalist enterprise, we discuss the way media industries produce content (news, entertainment media, and even pornography) to sell products, ideology, and consumerism itself.  By discussing scholarly literature and analyzing media representations that reify traditional notions of masculinity and femininity, promote unhealthy and unrealistic notions of beauty, and send harmful messages about notions of romance and sexuality, we will try to understand how media representations of gender play a role in gender socialization, the political and economic status of men and women, our day to day interactions with others, and even our self-views.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIOLOGY OF ANIMAL-HUMAN INTERACTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course, taught by zoological medicine veterinarian Dr. Lucy Spelman examines how we interact with animals-both domestic and wild-and how, in turn, these interactions affect us. Each week we focus on a different species, working our way up the taxonomic tree from corals to gorillas. We study the animal's basic biology, including its anatomy, natural history, and ecology. We consider the role it plays in human society, including as companions, as food, and, as sources of medicine and spiritual inspiration. We study how human activity is affecting its health and the ripple effect on our own health. We explore how agriculture, climate change, emerging diseases, habitat loss, hunting, and trade are driving many species to extinction. In the process, we discover that while many human-animal interactions are positive, many more are problematic, and that although we have solutions for most of these negative interactions, we often fail to implement them. Examples include excessive antibiotic use in cows, the continued loss of wetlands threatening frogs, and, the increasing number of coyotes favored by urban landscapes. We explore some of the underlying reasons for this inaction. In their final project, students identify a problematic human-animal interaction and explore solutions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course is designed to encourage you to explore the range of biological complexity in the animal world, the many ways we interact with animals, both domestic and wild, and, the scientific basis of the interconnectedness of health. You will also have the opportunity to explore solutions for problematic human-animal interactions; it is possible to live in balance with animals if we make informed decisions. The material presented will challenge you to learn more about animal classification, zoology, ecology, food animal science, veterinary medicine, public health, and conservation biology. For your final project, you will research a problematic human-animal interaction, explore potential solutions, and create a work of art or design that inspires others to take action</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LEADERSHIP OF SOCIAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Reflecting on historical and contemporary models of leadership, this course is designed to engage an active dialogue with the ways that collective social problems are both enabled and addressed by leaders. It also examines individual leadership potential by exploring how personal affinities can be focused and developed into effective strategies for solving problems, advancing ideas, and making change. Finally, it considers ethics, especially looking at the ways leadership can solve human problems. While primarily focused on public issues, this course will consider leadership in all economic spheres, and will look at the ways artists and designers practice leadership. In addition to reading, classroom discussion, and writing assignments, students will complete a community-based project in Providence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MULTICULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Multicultural Psychology is more than just understanding and appreciating diversity, it's about the influence that a multicultural world has on individuals and social systems that exist within it. Together we will explore the social constructs of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, and ability through readings, videos, in-class activities, and class discussion. Informed by psychological theory and research, we will examine the impact that these labels have on a person's identity development, societal positioning, and mental and physical health and well-being. By the end of the class, students will be able to explain the advantages and challenges that individuals and societies face as we become more interconnected in a diverse world. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUYING THE AMERICAN DREAM: AMERICAN CONSUMER CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The health of the American economy and, at times, the strength of our spirit as a people are measured by how much we spend on consumer goods.  Both individually and collectively, we are defined not only by what we purchase, but by the act of shopping itself. How did we become a nation of consumers?  Why do we spend?  What drives consumer demand?  Already in the late 19th century, middle-class values were shifting from thrift to indulgence.  At the time, however, we were still a producer nation and remained so for much of the 20th century.  More recently, the decline of manufacturing in the United States and the outsourcing of production in an increasingly globalized context have done little to cool our love affair with consumer goods.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Using an interdisciplinary American Studies approach that explores the intersections of history, material culture, gender and sexuality, race, immigration and ethnicity, and the built environment, this course examines the nature and expansion of mass consumption, the democratization of desire, types of consumer behaviors, the meanings attached to consumer goods and the act of spending, the role of technology and advertising, and the impact of mass consumption upon the built environment.  Neither a singular consumer monoculture nor American exceptionalism is assumed, moreover.  Different groups consume for different reasons and assign different meanings to the goods they purchase.  We will investigate consumption patterns over time among women, African-Americans, immigrants and their descendants, sexual minorities, and youth.  At the same time, studies of consumption within ethnic communities, in particular, suggest the creation of a transnational identity.  As a result, we will also explore globalized consumer products and patterns.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, the course will look at the various kinds of controls to which American consumerism has been subjected.  For example, regulation is a control; so are recession and war.  Regulation controls the supply side, affecting what goods are available, while recession puts restraints on consumer spending.  War achieves both.  No less powerful are the internal restraints arising from movements ranging from organized boycotts to visions of simplicity that embrace a more conscious or environmentally friendly consumption in some instances and, in rarer instances, eschew consumption altogether.  Fortunately for global manufacturers and American retailers alike, the Spartan practices of radical critics like "No Impact Man" have had limited appeal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NCSS CORE SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and juniors. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Mathematicians are artists of the imagination. This course is an exploration of their abstract conceptual systems which have almost inadvertently yielded spectacularly successful real world results. It also looks at suggested artistic modes of thought and strategies of artistic exploration. Discussions will include imagination as a valid perception of the world (a sixth sense); high orders of infinity; abstraction, idealization and reality; the geometry of vision, other non-Euclidean geometries and the relation of these geometries to our universe.  Regular attendance, some assignments and outside reading are required.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN ECOLOGY: HOW WILDLIFE INTERACTS WITH URBANIZING LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Cape Town, South Africa is predicted to be the first major city to run out of water. Day Zero, when the taps will run dry, is expected in Spring 2018.  How did we get here, and how do we fix it?  Learn the science behind the planet's water and how humanity interacts with it.  We will examine the causes and results of drought, salt-water contamination of wells and streams, shrinking aquifers and more. The goals of this course are threefold: (1) To clarify how water works in earth's systems (2) To outline how humans interact and leave their mark on every step of these cycles and (3) To encourage students to understand these water issues as challenges in need of the intelligent and creative solutions that they are equipped to deliver.  No prior science background is required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING AND MESSAGE: INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF SIGNS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We live amid a world of signs without which we could scarcely communicate or find our way through life.  The theory of signs, or semiotics, seeks to understand the nature of signs as vehicles of meaning in our perceptions and messages we send and receive in our spoken, textual, and visual communications.  This course moves from the analysis of signs and communication to a critical examination of the extension of semiotics to the surface and hidden meanings of dreams, handwriting, literary and art works.  At each step, we will endeavor to test the theories "in practice," to carefully evaluate their merits and limitations.  Through this, semiotics will emerge as a humanistic discipline that underwrites our critical and creative understanding of the world as well as funds our creative efforts to make the world anew.  Problem-based, discussion and lecture oriented with quizzes, practice-assignments, and short papers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i &gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>War is endemic to human civilization.  To some it has been an opportunity for glory, to many more a source of horror.  What are some of the ideas and ideals that have precipitated wars? How has the way it has been experienced by both combatants and noncombatants changed over time?  What are the legacies of war?  War and culture have had a defining influence on each other, most evident in art, language, literature, popular culture, design, and constructs of virtue.  This course will examine current wars through the lens of past wars, notably the Spanish-American War and World War One, touching on such topics as nationalism, terrorism, liberation movements, and the cultures that inspired them.  Through required readings, individual research and writing, and classroom discussion, students will examine some of the experiences, impacts and artifacts of war through the cultural manifestations that attend them. There will be a field trip to a local military historic site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over generations of time.  This course examines how evolution occurs through natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift, beginning with the search for the origin of species (speciation) by artist-naturalists Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates. Their observations of animal diversity (species variation, island geography, and mimicry) provided evidence for common descent within the animal kingdom, and led to the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection.  Studies of the fossil record paleontology yielded more evidence. Eventually, the genetic basis of evolution was explained by Gregor Mendel's discovery of heritable traits, later named genes.  Today, studies of evolution continue on a molecular scale with DNA and RNA (genomics) and proteins (protenomics).  Students will be graded based upon responses to study questions, participation during class discussion, performance on two written exams and a project on scientific visualization.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Harry Potter series is a worldwide phenomenon.  Although dismissed by some as simply books for children, the series grapples with real and difficult political and ethical questions.  In particular, the author addresses different aspects of racism and its effect on all parts of society, from the treatment of house-elves and goblins, the way some creatures (like werewolves) are ostracized by society, to the ever-present tension between pure-blood wizards and muggle-borns.  In this course, with the assistance of philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Niccolo Machiavelli, we will address these topics through lens of political philosophy to determine what the series can teach us about the nature and purpose of politics and power. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SOCIOLOGY OF BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BOTANY IN THE KITCHEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While we eat foods from over 60 different plant families, we rarely stop to consider how any of those plants might be related from an evolutionary standpoint, or why we might eat one species of the family (say the potato), but not another (the deadly nightshade). This course will look at the context in which the plants we eat exist among the hundreds of thousands of plants on this planet. Organized around the human culinary uses of plants, the class will explore the evolutionary relationships between foods, and discover what it is, that links them together.  We will examine the parts of plants humans consume, and in so doing discover how taste and nutritional value found in leaves, seeds, and roots, is linked to nutrition and protection for plants themselves. The seminar will culminate with a botanical feast, created by the class and featuring unique dishes created from taxonomically related groups of plants.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This Wintersession seminar has a focus on making holograms with lasers and on understanding the physics that makes holograms and lasers work. Ideas from familiar phenomena help us see the connections between everyday life and the abstract ideas of physics. This non-mathematical presentation of optics leads us to an appreciation of the logic and beauty behind the behavior of light. Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will address questions of how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. The field of cognitive neuroscience aims to link the mind, the brain and behavior by trying to understand the biological nature of human thought and behavior.  In this introductory course we will discuss several topics including: How is the brain built and how well can it rewire itself? How can we measure the living brain? What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most young people have developed their perspectives on the Vietnam War primarily through the medium of film. We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FIELDS OF GLORY: SPORTS AS CULTURAL INFLUENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In most advanced cultures of the world, the passion for sports has reached into many and unexpected aspects of society.  As participants or observers, we all, at one time or another, recognize the power of sports as spectacle, distraction or metaphor.  This course will examine the evolution of sport from competition among individual athletes in the ancient world through the rise of team sports in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It will then consider the influence of sports on language, politics, gender identity, art and architecture, literature, media, and apparel, among others.  Sports inevitably have an interrelation with class, race, and nationalism; and they have developed their own myth &amp; ritual &amp; hagiography, aesthetics, economy, cult of celebrity and statistical idiom.  There will be readings, assigned papers, classroom presentations, an exam and field trips to local sports events.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This 3-credit course is half of a 6-credit co-requisite course. This course is not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Students self-register for ILLUS-3912 or IDISC-3912: Art of Communicating Science via web registration.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration for the co-requisite course, SCI-W912: Art of Communicating Science is processed by Registrar's Office. &lt;BR&gt; This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. They also discover that science communication is about more than delivering just the facts. It can be entertaining, surprising, and controversial. The general topic is changing biodiversity: how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world. Through a series of exercises students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it visually. The science content will be delivered through lectures, readings, videos, and a visit to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete, meaningful, visible, and accessible. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D, animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces such as galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes weekly reading and response questions, in-studio exercises, weekly assignments, three completed artworks, and a comprehensive final project, which includes a written paper and a public engagement piece.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POLITICS OF LATIN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course presents a broad summary of some of the relevant issues about the political and economic development of Latin America since the colonial times to the present. Latin American countries are rich in natural resources, yet poverty and inequality are endemic. Political instability has been a common denominator in the region. Latin American countries have experienced dictatorships followed by democracy, and in some cases the return to authoritarian governments with coup d'tats and violent revolutions.  Students will learn about the main theories on democracy and development. They will use these theories to better understand why economic inequality and political instability are persistent in Latin America. By the end of this course students will also be able to answer other related questions: why are Latin American democratic institutions weak? What are the factors that explain migration (mostly to the United States)? How has the media contributed to a stereotyped construct of Latin America? Among others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RACE, EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM IN WORLD WAR I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>By examining the role of European colonies and colonial soldiers in World War I, this course offers a corrective to the standard narrative that the Great War was primarily a conflict between (White) Europeans. In addition to the material resources that the Europeans plundered from the colonies to support the war effort, at least four million colonial subjects from Africa and Asia fought under European rule. This class addresses WWI as a global conflict, thinking about how understandings of "difference" such as race, ethnicity, gender, and religion were constructed through transnational encounters, and how those constructs figured in to ideologies of culture and civilization. Contributing to this discussion will be an examination of the Russian and Ottomon Empires, including the Armenian genocide; the American Infantry Division called the "Black Rattlers" comprised of African American and Puerto Rican soldiers; and the restructuring of the Middle East. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on how humans use energy and how our needs can be met using "green" methods.  We will briefly cover the energy of the past (wood, coal, water, animal etc.), alternatives to this energy (nuclear, fuel cells, biofuel etc.) as well as the renewing of some old techniques (wind, water, solar etc.)  The goals of this course are threefold: (1) To understand how and why humans currently use energy (2) To understand how traditional energy production has been used to satisfy these needs and how alternative energy addresses the same needs (3) To develop innovative alternatives to traditional energy production or uses. This course will include a final project design solution to an aspect of one of the energy issues touched on in class. Two field trips will be scheduled to view alternative energy in action. No prior science background is required.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>East Asia has the largest population and one of the most vital economies in the world today. While serving as an economic powerhouse, the region also faces persistent social, cultural, and political challenges. Many of those challenges, such as the tension on the Korean peninsula and across the Taiwan strait, could be traced to the earlier history. This course provides an introduction to the histories of East Asia over the last four centuries. It would examine significant events in the region's history, including the encounter with the West, colonialism and imperialism, the rise of nationalism and Communist revolution, decolonization, World War Two, and the impact of the Cold War. We will explore the historical forces behind the changes of East Asian politics, society and cultures. Furthermore, through analyzing the historical complexity of East Asian affairs, we hope to contribute to the fostering of a peaceful, rational, and dynamic mechanism in the region. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

While serving as an economic powerhouse, the region also faces persistent social, cultural, and political challenges. Many of those challenges, such as the tension on the Korean peninsula and across the Taiwan strait, could be traced to the earlier history. This course provides an introduction to the histories of East Asia over the last four centuries. It would examine significant events in the region's history, including the encounter with the West, colonialism and imperialism, the rise of nationalism and Communist revolution, decolonization, World War Two, and the impact of the Cold War. We will explore the historical forces behind the changes of East Asian politics, society and cultures. Furthermore, through analyzing the historical complexity of East Asian affairs, we hope to contribute to the fostering of a peaceful, rational, and dynamic mechanism in the region. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Proponents of environmental justice affirm that all people have the right to live in a clean environment free from hazardous pollution or contamination, with access to the resources necessary to sustain a healthy livelihood. This class will examine how and why some people are denied this basic right. We will ask what social, political, economic, and racial processes drive environmental injustice. What material and ideological approaches can be used to undo, repair, or prevent environmental injustice? To answer these questions we will explore how social movement advocates and scholars identify, analyze, and engage with environmental inequalities. We will focus on the rise of the Environmental Justice Movement in the U.S. and globally, paying particular attention to: climate justice, Indigenous environmental movements, settler colonialism, the Green New Deal, and local environmental justice issues in Providence, RI.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is a social movement? This course examines how individuals and groups engage in collective activity to change social, economic, political, and cultural institutions. Importantly, we will examine countermovements, backlash, and a range of conservative and progressive movements. We will investigate the ways in which social movements develop narrative frames, art, and imagery to build movement resonance. In parallel, we will examine the strategies movement opponents may use to dismiss, appropriate, or re-frame contentious issues. This course will provide an introduction to major academic theories on social movement formation, tactical strategy, and decline, while exploring the ways in which social movement activism shapes and is shaped by culture. This course will draw on concrete examples from the Civil Rights, Environmental, Conservative, and Black Lives Matter Movements.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*AUSTRALIA: WITNESS TREE PROJECT: MEMORY, PLACE AND CULTURAL ECOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Witness Tree Project is a curricular initiative involving Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and the National Park Service (NPS). Witness trees, as designated by the NPS, are long-standing trees that have "witnessed" key events, trends and people in American history. The Project arranges for fallen witness tree(s) to be shipped from a national historic site to RISD, where in a joint history seminar and furniture studio, students interpret the history the tree(s) witnessed and make relevant objects from the trees wood. In addition to classroom study, the Project variously involves field trips, guest lectures, exhibition of student' objects and other events that highlight the significance of material culture, landscape and design in learning about American history. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Witness Tree Project for Wintersession 2020 will be working with Ash trees from the Hampton National Historical Site in Towson, MD.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for HPSS-W732 and FD-1732. Students will receive 3 liberal arts credits and  3 studio credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to sophomores and above.  &lt;br&gt; 2020WS Travel cost: $2,915.00 - airfare  not included.  &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORY OF MIND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Human social interaction relies upon the ability to correctly attribute beliefs, goals, and percepts to other people. This set of meta-representational abilities-a "theory of mind"-allows us to understand the behaviour of others. Individuals with autism are often thought to lack a theory of mind as they show impairments on tasks testing this ability, as well as impairments on tasks involving language and face processing. In this course we will examine the links between these three domains-language, face processing and social cognition, and the role each plays in helping us navigate the social world. Students will be expected to complete several short-answer assignments designed to evaluate mastery of the readings and material covered in class, as well as a research paper on any topic of their choice, provided it is related to the subject matter of the class. In this paper students will be expected to advance a coherent thesis, and support it with evidence from the scholarly literature.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The purpose of this course is to introduce you to human cognition or the scientific study of the mind. We will take an information processing view of psychological functions. Thus we will spend much of our time discussing information, in the form of mental representations, and how this information is transformed in the mind. We will examine how perceptual information enters the mind, how attention is used to select from the array of available incoming sensory information, how knowledge is encoded, stored in and retrieved from memory, how information is conveyed to others via language, and how information is used in reasoning and decision making. The aim of the course is to become familiar with the tools of research used in cognitive psychology and with questions that motivate researchers in the field. You will be expected to complete several short-answer assignments and labs designed to evaluate mastery of the readings and material covered in class. You will also be required to complete a research paper on any topic of your choice related to the subject matter of the class.

We will examine how the law defines art and the First Amendment through study of issues around speech and censorship; art and intellectual property, including copyright and moral rights; art and the protections given to cultural property. The class will also consider how artists have responded to the constraints placed upon them and their work by the law by examining their challenges to legal norms.

   <COURSEDESC>This course offers an overview of the interdisciplinary field of environmental psychology. We will explore the dynamic relationships between people and places in order to understand how our behavior and cultural values shape our environment, and how in turn, our surroundings affect us. Using the lens of environments where we live, work and play, we will examine the everyday experience of different types of places including the home, institutional settings, public space, and play spaces. Attention will be placed upon social and spatial inequalities, local and global relations, and intersections of race, gender, sexual orientation, culture, and power. We will explore psychological questions of perception, place identity, culture, place attachment, cognition, and the meaning of spaces through readings, film, visual exercises, and environmental analysis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

If so, social psychology addresses these questions and many more. Social psychology is the science of how others influence the way people think, feel, and act. The aim of this course is to familiarize you with current and classic research and theory in social psychology, help you to develop critical thinking skills about social-psychological phenomena, and stimulate you to think about the implications of social-psychological research for everyday living.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We are investigating not only the music, but also how those who participated in jazz culture navigated the "city" as an economic, social, and political environment.</COURSEDESC>

Although dismissed by some as simply books for children, the series grapples with real and difficult political and ethical questions.  In particular, the author addresses different aspects of racism and its effect on all parts of society, from the treatment of house-elves and goblins, the way some creatures (like werewolves) are ostracized by society, to the ever-present tension between pure-blood wizards and muggle-borns.  In this course, with the assistance of philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Niccolo Machiavelli, we will address these topics through lens of political philosophy to determine what the series can teach us about the nature and purpose of politics and power. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

To evaluate these theories, we will apply them to various types of humor, such as comedies, jokes, and especially in visual illustration such as cartoons, and the like.  The serious business of analysis will share the stage with our engagement with funny business as well as creating our own.  Throughout, we will consider the ethical issues of humor and laughter as they arise in the theories and the practices of humor. Course requires a sense of humor and will involve active participation, even performing humor.  Several papers and a project of either analyzing something comedic or developing your own.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE NEW ENGLAND LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Richly varied and dynamic, the New England landscape has been remade many times over, beginning with the arrival of European colonists, through successive waves of deforestation and reforestation, industrialization, the development of leisure and tourism, and today's post-industrial economy. This course explores the different elements of New England's cultural landscape as well as the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and natural forces that have shaped that landscape over four centuries. While examining what different places look like and how they have changed over time, we will pay close attention to the various meanings assigned to them by those who possess and inhabit them. We will also ask what different landscapes can tell us about who holds power, and how power is expressed and resisted. We look at the built environment because it is a valuable primary source in the work of cultural historians, but also because "place" is in itself an important player worthy of exploration and understanding in its own right. We shape places, but they also shape us.  By observing and analyzing cities and suburbs, farms and forests, beaches and burial grounds, mansions and mills, townhouses and triple-deckers, colleges and casinos, parks and ports, ski slopes and shipyards, tourist destinations and transit systems, we will attempt to mine the landscape for insights into what makes New England distinctive and what forms our regional identity, keeping in mind the ways in which New England's cultural landscape is also a reflection of the landscape of the United States. Finally, we will consider the ways in which the New England landscape continues to be shaped by new forces, both local and global, as well as an increasingly volatile climate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COGNITION FOR DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines." (Donald Norman,  The Design of Everyday Things) Design represents the intersection of technology and psychology in that designers must communicate to to the people who will eventually use the objects they design what the object is for and how it should be used. This means starting with a good understanding of how people's minds work-emphasizing information that is important to understanding the structure and use of the object and eliminating the information that is not. In this course we will examine principles of human perception, attention, memory and mental processing that allow designers to tailor their products to the cognitive capabilities of users.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY OF CARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Throughout this course we will engage with the Environmental Psychology of Care through several areas described below. Taking advantage of the diverse settings and opportunities of Rhode Island, this course includes field trips (such as a Moroccan Caf, a community designed park and a guerrilla garden), phenomenological experiments (e.g. traveling with a stroller or suitcase through different environments), and guest speakers. Also, we will focus briefly on concepts of power and how they are actualized in issues such as racism, class distinctions and the like; techniques of exclusion, exploitation, deflection and distraction. Through readings, visual examples, and discussions, we will explore and analyze how the built environment enables and disables people, and what caring environments entail. Some of our focus will be on institutional settings, but we will also look carefully at everyday environments- environments designed for diversity and inclusion which allow people with diverse abilities, different cultural backgrounds and possible conflicting needs to feel welcome and participate in society. We will also consider innovative new designs, as well as existing models of neighborhoods, global cities, and cultural traditions. To do this we will investigate different ideological and philosophical approaches with implications of how we relate to the environment, ranging from existential approaches of "being-in-the-world" to concepts of "dwelling" and how these attitudes can be manifested in practice, objects and the built environment. We will read about and visit with groups who embrace different approaches for working together to care for places. These include environmental restoration, community arts and other forms of collective imagining and action. Finally, working in small groups, each class member will be expected to actively apply concepts from the class to a project defined as significant by the entire group.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REVOLTING BODIES: AESTHETICS, REPRESENTATION, AND POPULAR CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our understanding of others and ourselves are formed by visual images and bodily feelings that are social in origin. They make us feel (un)comfortable, sublime, ridiculous, grotesque. In this course we will examine how the materiality of the body grounds the meanings we attach to identity and subjectivity. The course moves between cultural studies, queer theory, disability studies, literary analysis, and film theory asking how representations structure the way we "know" and "see" bodies. Ultimately, we will explore how revolting bodies-bodies that disgust, repulse, signal their difference-can become bodies in revolt-bodies that resist and imagine new possibilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do representations of robots and cyborgs in popular film, sci-fi literature, and music tell us about gender, sexuality, race, and what it means to be "human?" Using queer of color critique, feminist theory, disability studies, and science and technology studies (STS), we will investigate the ways that science fiction's disruption of race, gender, and sexuality as stable categories offers radical models for our present and possible futures. Our case examples explore the politics of the body through narratives of artificial intelligence, sex work, urbanism and segregation, biotech research, prosthetics and athleticism, new reproductive technologies, and more. We will engage with poetry, film, visual art, and speculative fiction to explore how bodies are dreamed, crafted, and represented as these works re-imagine bodily and social estrangement in the present through the creation of counter-futures.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Topics in History, Philosophy, and the Social Sciences is an introductory course in which students are encouraged to develop the skills in critical thinking, reading, and writing that are common to the disciplines represented in the Department of History, Philosophy, and the Social Sciences (HPSS). Sections focus on the topics typically addressed within the department's disciplines; through discussion about key texts and issues, students are introduced to important disciplinary methodologies and controversies. All sections have frequent writing assignments, which, combined with substantial feedback from HPSS faculty, afford students the opportunity to develop the strategies and techniques of effective writing.  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Required for graduation for all undergraduates, including transfers. There are no waivers for HPSS-S101 except for transfer students who have taken an equivalent college course. &lt;br&gt; Freshman registration: see PDF on the Registrar's Office website for instructors and course description information. &lt;BR&gt; Transfer students: register for one of the evening sections available to upperclass and transfer students.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SOCIOLOGY OF BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO GENDER AND WOMEN'S STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will address the dynamics, history, and context of gender-based privilege and intersectional oppression in US culture. We will accomplish this  interdisciplinarily through academic text, video, pop-cultural analysis, and personal experiences. Potential topics include: feminist activism, systems of privilege and oppression, learning gender, the body, family dynamics, work, gender-based violence, sex and intimacy, health and reproductive justice, the law, religion, and more. In a cisheteronormative culture, we acknowledge that while the gender binary is not real, its impact is very real. As such, we will analyze the ways the binary affects us all as we grow from children in adulthood, and the realities of living outside of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NEUROECONOMICS: THE SCIENCE OF DECISION-MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What happens in your brain when you decide to buy a lottery ticket or go on a date with someone? What about when you spend hundreds of dollars on an expensive gadget that you stop using after a few months, or when you decide to say something that you should have known would be embarrassing? Are economic decisions and decisions in general the result of a messy fight between a `rational' part of your brain and an `irrational' one, or is decision-making all the result of one underlying and possibly unconscious mechanism? This course is designed to give a tour of the brain in its capacity as the `organ of economics', exploring the neuroscience of decision-making and its implications for how we think about rationality and the nature of value. It should thus be of interest to anyone curious about how and why we make the decisions we make and how, if possible, to make them better  - so students in this course will be uniquely well-situated to understand why they decided to take it!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Philosophically, the ID Department believes that students become better designers when they have an intimate knowledge of a range of natural and synthetic materials. In this course, students will learn about the properties of natural wood and engineered wood-based materials, investigate the related technical processes, and evaluate how this information is both connected to and influenced by the design process. Students will work with materials directly and master skills needed to manipulate these materials. They will develop projects that allow them to engage in the design and development process, promote creativity, problem solving, and the correct use of materials.

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS COMMUNICATIONS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications I is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on design research methods. Together, we will spend the fall semester casting about, planning and prototyping towards some kind of design proposal or product for execution in the spring. We think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. On the tool for design side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We use writing to help clarify and crystalize the thesis plan. On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of writing and how to think about what they want and need. We talk about the thesis as a tool for explaining the design but also as a tool for helping you advance your career goals. At the end of the course, you will have a partially complete draft of your thesis. which will set you up for an excellent spring.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop teaches the basics of Rhino and introduces students to 3D modeling through an "exploratory process." Recognizing that experts devise many approaches to surface modeling Rhino Workshop: Exploratory Learning for 3D modeling uses four discrete projects each with a specific set of commands and features that will be explored as students fulfill the project's design brief and discover their own operational style. This approach flips the classroom experience - students use tutorials as necessary to identify techniques for basic surface modeling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the completion of the workshop, students will be able to use Rhino as a design tool in their own design process - using the software to simulate projects in 3 dimensions or exporting 3D files to 2D for presentation purposes. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop teaches the basics of Rhino and introduces students to 3D modeling through an "exploratory process." Recognizing that experts devise many approaches to surface modeling Rhino Workshop: Exploratory Learning for 3D modeling uses four discrete projects each with a specific set of commands and features that will be explored as students fulfill the project's design brief and discover their own operational style. This approach flips the classroom experience - students use tutorials as necessary to identify techniques for basic surface modeling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the completion of the workshop, students will be able to use Rhino as a design tool in their own design process - using the software to simulate projects in 3 dimensions or exporting 3D files to 2D for presentation purposes. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt; This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business.&lt;BR&gt; The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications II is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on completing your thesis. Together, we will spend the spring semester finishing the thesis and thesis book that you proposed at the end of Graduate Thesis Communications I. We continue to think about writing as a design tool and as a communication tool. For this course, we put more emphasis on the communication aspect. Together, we will continue to refine and strengthen the manner by which you explain your thesis to yourself and others. We will think about audience, voice, structure, and form. We will explore different ways of communicating the same idea in different contexts and mediums (visual, oral, written). We will examine how to share our work and with whom. At the end of the course, you will have a complete thesis.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, ID graduate students only Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this class we practice a variety of digital and freehand methods of design exploration and visual communication used by designers. These sketching and rendering skills are ideal for anyone who has to understand and resolve form while communicating ideas within interdisciplinary environments. We will focus on the redesign of a few objects, starting with some sketching from the ideation phase through to a final solution that describes the aesthetic and emotive intentions, as well as demonstrates knowledge of functional or unique manufacturing requirements. The class is built on the belief that strong two-dimensional skills remain the essential tool for product designers.  &lt;BR&gt;  Students attending the first module will be required to participate in the final critique on the final day of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop teaches the basics of Rhino and introduces students to 3D modeling through an "exploratory process." Recognizing that experts devise many approaches to surface modeling Rhino Workshop: Exploratory Learning for 3D modeling uses four discrete projects each with a specific set of commands and features that will be explored as students fulfill the project's design brief and discover their own operational style. This approach flips the classroom experience - students use tutorials as necessary to identify techniques for basic surface modeling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the completion of the workshop, students will be able to use Rhino as a design tool in their own design process - using the software to simulate projects in 3 dimensions or exporting 3D files to 2D for presentation purposes. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DISRUPTIVE CREATIVITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Using diverse, unexpected and unusual precedents, the class will look critically at the tools used/made/appropriated to change the world. The course aims to help students understand the conscious and unconscious ways they participate in and reproduce structures of power - and the disruptive opportunities for creativity to both perpetuate and problematize our realities. We will use discussion, research, assigned reading and other media to better understand and practice systemic thinking and attention to unintended consequences when designing or using these tools to instigate change. In this vein, students will be guided through impact mapping with a particular focus to the structural constraints imposed by legal and human rights frameworks. Students will be challenged to continuously put methods into practice through ideation sketching and using quick conceptual design proposals as a reflective tool, and as a response to case studies.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to ID Graduate Students only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>UI/UX DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Emerging web interfaces have grown towards several platforms, such as: smart phones, tablets, Windows OS, Mac OS. As of last year, Adobe released software that offers designers a new interface especially geared towards app and web design for several platforms in the same file. This allows designers to build web experiences for different user interfaces more easily, and with more consistency.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will learn to work with Adobe XD. The software has two modes: a "design" mode to build graphic elements tailored towards web graphics, and a "prototype" mode that prototypes the navigation interface through an app or web site. By learning Adobe XD, students will be able to build working prototypes of a web interface that functions and navigates, without requiring knowledge of coding.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the course students design and develop a user interface of their choosing. By the end of the course, students will have a complete set of user interfaces for at least two platforms (smart phone &amp; web browser). Prototypes can be viewed on phones and internet browsers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The instructor has professional experience designing software and user interfaces. With the use of new Adobe XD software behind the production of user interfaces, students will get more power and capabilities towards their work than with past UI/UX design tools.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO GAME DESIGN &amp; DEVELOPMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Play is a foundational component of the human experience. Games, or rule-based play, have never been more popular, commercially successful, or culturally important than today. From soccer to poker to World of Warcraft, games captivate and stimulate the body and mind. Learning how games work and how to make them provides a solid understanding of dynamic interactive systems. This class will focus on paper prototyping and physical game development. We will examine the rules and play of board games, card games, sports, and digital games. Students will gain an understanding of the game development process with a focus on prototyping and play-testing in an iterative loop. The art, design, and craft of making games can be applied to a broad range of fields including service, experience, graphic, interactive, and urban design. This class will establish a basic level of competency for beginners while providing a platform for more complicated projects (including digital games) for those with more experience.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING FOR LIFE OFF PLANET</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The strive to venture away from our terrestrial home into the vast unknowns of the universe is an ongoing endeavour. But in order to survive away from planet earth all aspects of life have to be considered and designed. Everything on board such as clothing, toilets, food, and even air have to be carefully constructed and maintained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this studio we will use speculative and critical design methods to explore the complex possibilities associated with maintaining life off planet Earth. The course will involve prototyping for survival in extreme environments and reimagining domestic life with the constraints of advancing knowledge in space. We will create diegetic prototypes which extrapolate from current scientific advances and design problems experienced in current space missions to design for the future ephemera of space travel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will be split into two short briefs and one longer project exploring different facets of design for survival in long term missions. The final deliverables will be a portfolio of objects that together might indicate what kind of world we want to create for ourselves away from the blue and green dot we call home.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to seniors and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt; This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business.&lt;BR&gt; The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM UNIFORM TO MULTIFORM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the construct of the jumpsuit from uniform to multiform across history, art, fashion, politics, and sociological constructs.  With its inception in 1919 as a utilitarian suit used literally for jumping (extreme sports such as skydiving and parachuting), the jumpsuit has taken diverse forms that have led us into new frontiers in both conservative and undefinable realms. The jumpsuit stood as a symbol of women's new roles in WW2, brands the incarcerated, is used in art and social-political movements like BRICK X BRICK, worn in the performative sculptures of Lucy Orta and explores counter-fashion with the Rational Dress Society.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt; This class will take a closer look at the designs that have shaped history and push us to explore its next incarnation into the future world through the use of new materials, fabrication methods, and manipulation of other soft architecture techniques. These include the use of recycled goods, biomaterials, found objects in combination with traditional textiles such as pattern making, sewing, silk screening, embroidery and others. Beginner's sewing and pattern making skills are recommended, but are not essential, as crash skills tutorials will be provided as we move through the class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; ID majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Magazines, newspapers and other publications rely heavily on pictures to illuminate messages initiated by writers, and unlike any other genre of illustration, the editorial field gives voice to the artist. In this alternately reactive and expressive line of work, the illustrator engages in a powerful partnership with the written word, effectively becoming an author of opinions and ideas. This class will approach several editorial assignments, all of which involve an illustrated response to written text. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>STYLE &amp; SUBSTANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is an art of visual communication. Style is simply the illustrator's vocabulary. Substance is what the illustrator has chosen to express. The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields.

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT'S YOUR STORY?</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When we choose a story to read, retell, or illustrate, that choice reveals something about ourselves. What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMALIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Animals have enjoyed a prominent place in art for as long as humans have been creating it, beginning with the caves in Lascaux. Along the way they have figured prominently in myths fables and allegories, fulfilling symbolic roles in a wealth of picture books, and appeared as frequent players in visual metaphors employed by editorial illustrators. This course will provide opportunities for students to work within a variety of illustration genres, finding their own approach to working with representations of animal life. There will be in-depth exploration of creature anthropomorphism and its uses- from social and political satire to its capabilities in a wide range of storytelling methods. From JJ Granville to Spiegelman's Maus, to children's book greats like Richard Scarry and Arthur Geisert, the human-animal/animal-human is an enduring motif that will continue to be reinvented and expanded upon. Students will have the ability to channel projects and assignments towards formats of their choosing - including painting and other gallery-based practices, children's publishing, artist books, comics and zines. &lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>VISIBLE CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A society's history is written in its stones. From the dystopias of Gotham City or Grand Theft Auto, the hive mind of the Borg and the ecstatic asceticism of the Shakers, to the suburban conformity of Levittown and the Sphinx half buried in sand, every city, every society, is an embodiment of ideas, history, geography, and beliefs. Each built environment has its own logic, both architectural and cultural. With some provocative writings about the phenomenon of the city as inspiration, you will be asked to conceptualize a place and bring it to life visually. The essence of a city - its buildings, pathways, public and private spaces - depends on how you define the character of its people, its government, its history, its geographic siting and even its language.&lt;BR&gt; After defining a back-story in broad strokes, you will begin researching the implications of those choices visually. Working from thumbnails and sketches to finished conceptualization, you will explore compelling physical and conceptual viewpoints, with a variety of possibilities in the use of media and technique. Rather than limiting ourselves to purely pragmatic architecture, the class will be searching for imaginative visualizations, where form becomes poetic metaphor suggestive of narrative.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Throughout history, the natural environment has been a subject of charm and awe for the artist, from the delicately painted frescoes in ancient Roman homes to the 16th century, when the landscape transcended the role of 'background', and gained momentum as a sublime subject in its own right. This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Escher, to the mid-20th Century comic characters of Stan Lee and classic 1950's science fiction films, fantasy images provide a rich source of inspiration for the contemporary artist/illustrator. In this course, we will study the art of Surrealist artists such as Magritte and Max Ernst, the unique fruit and vegetable portraits of Archimboldo, investigate the abstract dream imagery of Hilma Af Klint and Carl Jung, and the seminal graphic novels of Sue Coe (Porkopolis) and Art Spiegelman (Maus). We will interpret text and film as we create our own fantasy paintings working with appropriated imagery, collage, and painting mediums such as oil, acrylic, gouache and watercolor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>One commonality amongst all illustrators is the ability to draw. This course builds on principles of traditional drawing, color theory, composition, and with a focus on observational drawing using digital tablet devices. Students will expand on techniques learned at the introductory level to broaden their use of digital mark making tools. Weekly classroom exercise in the first two-thirds of the semester range from careful studies of objects and figures in space, to capturing landscape settings; with the last third engaged in exploring painting from imagination. More involved homework assignments will challenge students to adapt previously acquired drawing skills translated into the digital medium. The main computer application to be used in the course is Photoshop, with an introduction to Painter toward the end of the semester. The goal of the class is to give students a strong foundation in digital painting that can be adapted to their future professional Illustration practice.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURING SOUND: MUSIC + ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration, along with painting, printmaking and many other visual art practices, is continually intertwined with music. From illustrators collaborating on videos, packaging and promotion, to creating graphic novel and picture biographies of musicians and musical movements, the tradition of connecting the visual to the acoustic has a rich history. &lt;BR&gt;   Music will always need to be celebrated larger and in a more tactile way than on a screen-we are seeing the enduring inventiveness of the gig poster, and even the 12" LP cover is still alive as a canvas. Projects in this class will explore promotional, interpretive, and investigative approaches as they relate to musicians, lyrics and titles, as well as parallels between music and visual art. Students will have the chance to interpret musical works in a number of ways, including through narrative approaches, using sculpture, animation and GIFs, and other less conventional means.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be exploration of analogous aspects of music and visual art-sound and color, time based works, performative aspects and related ideas (e.g.: the movements of the hand while drawing/painting as analogous to playing an instrument). There will be some focus too, on genres and movements where music and art have close relationships, ie: psychedelia, pop and op art, comics and set design.  Lectures and discussion will also be devoted to learning about artists who create both visual and musical work.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Whether using traditional materials or digital technologies, sculpture is enormously nuanced in what it can suggest. In this class we will examine how objects and various sculptural strategies can be used to convey complex concepts and ideas. A survey of contemporary sculpture and 3D illustration will provide plenty of conceptual, process and material exploration. The class is offered in conjunction with RISD CoWorks to promote experimentation, interdisciplinarity, and access to advanced technologies. Projects are structured to introduce you to a variety of materials and methods of working, including paper manipulation, box making, character design, model-making, 3D printing, and lazer-cutting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Additionally students will learn how to light and photograph three-dimensional work for reproduction or portfolio.

   <COURSEDESC>This is a survey course designed to enable students to develop a wide body of work in three-dimensional moving art pieces. Students are exposed to a large range of types of movement and the challenges inherent in getting those movements to operate smoothly. The pieces are made from a wide range of materials, including but not limited to wood, cardboard, wire, metal, plastic, Sculpey, and paint. &lt;br&gt; There are three elements in each project: the idea, mechanism and surface treatment. Assignments will be given based on the mechanism. Students bring the subject and story to the piece. The mechanisms covered include: action/ reaction, balance/ counter balance, whirlygig, cams and cranks, motion-triggered lights and sound. Molds will be incorporated into the assignments. All projects are painted. &lt;br&gt; This course requires students to develop a working knowledge of a range of tools, from simple hand tools to more complex tools available in our wood shop. Exercises and focused workshops on tool usage will be a fundamental part of the class. Prior experience with tools is helpful but not necessary. &lt;br&gt; The class culminates with a "Come Play With Us" show of students' completed projects. Elementary school children and the RISD Community are invited to play with the pieces, with an emphasis on fun. The projects have to work; they need to be built to withstand all types of child's play.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These will include storyboarding, color key creation, and production illustrations. Our goal is to build the essential skills needed to participate in the narrative process of filmmaking. You will work both individually and in groups on a series of assignments to create finished works that build your individual skills, and demonstrate your abilities to work on a story team in a cinematic production. We will examine camera placement and frame-to-frame clarity by creating storyboards for different scenarios.  In addition, to explore the emotional beats of a narrative, you will create lighting and color keys.  In the final weeks, we will create a finished production illustration for a narrative that will be either supplied or created by the student.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING I: COLOR PERCEPTION AND EXPRESSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustrated typography and hand lettering are enjoying a wonderfully prominent place in the visual landscape of design, publishing  and illustration, and have become an increasingly vital part of many illustrator's professional portfolios. What can illustrated type and it's particular characteristics provide as an alternative to established typefaces? How does an illustrator find the right balance between form and function, expression and readability? This course will provide the opportunity to employ drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, photography, digital tools and other media in the creation of unique letterforms. Students will be encouraged to experiment with non-traditional materials -including three-dimensional ones. Beginning with an introduction to basic typographic elements, terminology, and font families, students will move into creating their own unique lettering for projects including posters, book covers, and packaging.  Typography will be the central focus, but students will have leeway as to the degree with which it is integrated with other illustrative imagery. Along with these projects students will create a complete unique typeface over the course of the semester. Relevant issues related to hand drawn text-type for comics, picture books, and graphic novels - including appropriateness, readability and voice, will also be covered.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE CHANGING NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Changing Narrative will explore the challenges and possibilities of innovative storytelling structure: non-linear, interactive, multimedia. In this class, students will create inventive work at the intersection of physical and digital media, the old and the new. Students will be introduced to classic dramatic structures across cultures-Asian Kishotenketsu, Freytag's pyramid, Shakespearean tragedy-and learn fundamental digital skills via class demonstrations and exercises. Drawing from these patterns and tools, students will then seek to unveil new storytelling possibilities granted by modern technology (computer animation, touch screen interaction, hypermedia) to traditional artforms (illustration, comics, gaming). What happens when a comic's panel starts to move? Where does a story go if the reader is allowed to make decisions? Students will investigate these creative avenues and create playful, hybrid stories.&lt;BR&gt;   Along the course of the semester, assignments will notably include short-form animated illustrations, experiments with gamebooks and cartoon strips, culminating in a final, long-form narrative project.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; This course fulfills EITHER the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement OR the Computer Literacy requirement, not both, for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LARGE WOODCUT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the world's first print technique, woodcut had a profound affect on the development of all printing -especially the Japanese woodblock process which has influenced so many artists. It uses minimal technology, requiring only a sturdy table, a few simple cutting and inking tools, and a wooden spoon to print the block. Despite the simplicity of the medium, resulting prints are as individual as the artist who makes them. An artist is able to make many identical prints of their image, which makes woodcut a great tool for experimenting with your ideas. Whether you enjoy work with a bold graphic quality or a delicate organic line, woodcut is an ideal medium for those that enjoy the physicality of materials. The class will cover the basics of woodcut prints to gain an understanding of the three components of this process: color separation, carving, and printing. Participants will learn about the required materials and tools, how to safely and effectively cut an image into the woodblock, and how to print it. The class will focus on how to organize and print large scale, complex, nuanced multicolored woodcuts. Reduction and multi-block techniques will be shown as a means of developing personal imagery. This one-of-a- kind course gives students a traditional printmaking skill that is environmentally friendly, can be done at home, on any scale.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SILKSCREENED POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since before the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsides" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAGON CONCEPT &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, IN 3-D MIXED MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course begins with the investigation of Dragons, compelling monstrous and mythological creatures found throughout the history of art in various cultures. Students will research historic forms and consider the purposes dragons and other monsters serve in various contexts, in preparation for designing and building their own "dragon".  Multiple theories of aesthetics relating to sculpture will be presented keeping in mind that three-dimensional objects are among the oldest and most expressive forms of representation and can be considered both the most traditional and the most innovative of artistic endeavors. Key artists such as Donatello, Rodin, and Henry Moore will be studied. A premise of the class is that in breaking the constraints of the 2 dimensional canvas, sculpture has mass and volume, and occupies space in a way impossible to achieve in painting or drawing. Consequently, working in three dimensions provides previously unimagined challenges and opportunities, and creates new pathways for learning; Students in this class will therefore be encouraged to take an experimental approach to creating form. The knowledge and experience gained here should help students become better artists in general and in future artistic endeavors not directly related to the specific material presented in the course.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. Emphasis is placed on Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with show critical writing or discussions. Additionally there are weekly readings, a research project, quizzes and a final exam. Textbook required. Books will be on reserve at the RISD Library and available for purchase at a student discount. Study images are made available on RISD Digication.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is an art of visual communication. Style is simply the illustrator's vocabulary. Substance is what the illustrator has chosen to express. The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Nothing creates light and translucency like the combination of watercolor and gouache. It's quickness of application and short drying time have made it a go to medium for most children book illustrators as well as editorial and spot illustration image makers. This course will provide the student with the opportunity to explore a variety of watercolor and gouache techniques while investigating how the medium can be used to successfully communicate ideas and evoke a range of feelings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The practice of making several preliminary compositional and value studies will be emphasized. By learning how to predict where the water and pigment will go in variety of circumstances, the students will learn how to apply the paint with confidence without fussing or losing the light that comes from the paper itself. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The class assignments revolve around a wide range of subject matter to enable students to develop a personal visual vocabulary with the media. Later in the course students will create their own individual projects. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PERSPECTIVE DRAWING PROJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Creating believable space on a two-dimensional surface takes a thorough understanding of the principles of linear, aerial and tonal perspective. Bold and nuanced application of these principles are vital to making believable space in your drawings.   This course is designed to allow students the opportunity to explore perspective in more depth than is possible in sophomore drawing. The class will begin with a review of basic one- and two-point perspective, then progress to more challenging applications of creating and understanding space.  By the end of the term, students will be able to invent spaces through their handling of perspective rather than relying on drawing space from direct observation. The medium used in the class is graphite. Beginning homework assignments correspond to the material covered in class. The second half of the semester is dedicated to the development of a large tonal drawing.  Students will conceive, research, design, find image references to enhance details and specificity, and finally execute their final large piece.  The drawing is done in class and for homework throughout the last six weeks of the semester.  Students will receive weekly input on their drawing through large and small group crits, and through individual meetings with the instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO OIL PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Oil painting is one of the richest, most powerfully expressive mediums that exist.  It offers a vast diversity of approaches and provides the most flexibility of all the painting materials. To take advantage of that variety, certain technical knowledge is essential. This class is geared as a thorough introduction to the newer oil painter. Our early class focus will be on understanding materials through a variety of life study exercises. Focus on color and composition will promote effectively orchestrated images. Our ultimate goal will be to make powerful images that marry appropriate approaches to oil painting with personal vision. The class emphasis will balance the technical mastery of materials with the clarity of effective visual communication. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>XXXY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we examine gender -- not your biologically assigned equipment, but those social constructs that shape and define what is male, what is female and what is that less absolute space between and beyond. Weekly assignments often begin by reviewing the traditional role of women and men in American culture but through a contemporary lens, examining the astoundingly colorful range of gender and sex identities that cannot be limited to simply pink and blue. We'll turn stereotypes inside out, flip popular icons upside down, and rework familiar images from hallowed museums. We'll search for fresh depictions of abstract concepts like conception, contraception, relationships, power, etc. This course offers equal opportunity for XX's, XY's and those outside the binary..&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PLAY AT WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustrators invent all the time: a "concept" is nothing more than invention. This course aims to expand the illustrator's definition of and capacity for invention, both on the page and beyond. The object of invention herein is delight. Students in this course will conceive and develop three distinct projects - the for children, the second for adults, the third at the student's discretion. Each project in development will test its premise: it will expose inspiration to proof. The ultimate criterion for success, whatever form the project has taken, will be, "Is it delightful?". If an invention is both original and delightful it may well have commercial potential; while this is not the object of the course, commercial potential will of course be considered. Classes will ideally be of seminar size. They will consist of speculation, discussion, suggestion and critique: skull sessions. Such dialogue is essential to the generation and development of both premise and project; it will comprise the majority of class time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to merge imagery from various sources is an essential skill for illustrators and fine artists alike.  In a series of projects, students will gather sketches, drawings and photographs, and combine them to exist solidly and convincingly together in space.  We will discuss the importance of lighting, color, and value in creating a believable scene, and explore the methods and techniques used by illustrators and painters past and present.  Class time will be divided between the computer lab (where students will manipulate their images using Photoshop and other tools) and the studio, where illustrations and paintings will be completed using a variety of media, including pen and ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;  This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;Br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Weekly assignments combine illustration objectives with a playful spirit of exploring materials for its own sake. Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.   &lt;BR&gt; Techniques with paper pulp, polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (as low-relief and over armatures). Scavenged objects and supplies to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations are another way to create images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished with mixed media, collage and other treatments that unify the whole. Idea and technique come together so these illustrations will be anything but shallow.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Virtual Reality Design for Palliative Care is a pilot course designed to allow students to experiment purposefully in the creation of virtual reality environments. We will measure the success of our work against a goal of providing comforting and liberating experiences for hospital patients with limited mobility, psychological or pain-management problems.   The course proceeds from the assumption that the life experiences of the students, reinforced or modified by directed readings, can provide empathetic insight into visual, spatial and narrative elements that will prove positively reinforcing, uplifting and exciting to others, including those who might be facing significant medical challenges.  Through learning about the medium of immersive virtual reality (3D computer graphics viewed through a head mounted display) the course will address the limitations of this medium as well as its exciting possibilities. We will seek to understand the nature of virtual space, points of similarity and difference with everyday experience. Various themes and templates will be the basis of our projects, exploring design metaphors and seeking insight and connection with the imagined experience of our prospective users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration to juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Statement of Intent required; Permission of instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The formal characteristics include flatness, strong graphic quality, awareness of figure/ground, scale, color, placement-these all take precedence over naturalistic concerns, rendering and perspective. This is a stylistic approach that lends itself to clear, conceptual communication. The goal of communication is always primary; and assignments will require problem-solving as well as development of clear and refined graphic approach. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GAINED IN TRANSLATION: COMICS AS ADAPTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Done well, respectful, original, and inventive adaptations can deliver fresh interpretations of original sources that are themselves new works of art that stand on their own merits. In this course, students will adapt written works from a variety of source materials into multi-page comics stories - demonstrating how form, narrative arc, cultural context, character, and emotion can be translated faithfully and artfully from one medium to another.  In the process of doing the work, students will master the language of comics, a medium with its own vernacular, using unique combinations of words and pictures to form meaning - and will gain insights into shared principles of story-telling that apply both to prose and to visual narrative.  After deep reading of the texts, to understand structure, story, and meaning, students will interpret and visually amplify the adapted texts, taking the new work from thumbnail, to full sketch, to final art, to self-published mini-comics. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMATIC STORYTELLING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine various storytelling techniques used in cinema that are essential in guiding the look and feel of a film. These will include storyboarding, color key creation, and production illustrations. Our goal is to build the essential skills needed to participate in the narrative process of filmmaking. You will work both individually and in groups on a series of assignments to create finished works that build your individual skills, and demonstrate your abilities to work on a story team in a cinematic production. We will examine camera placement and frame-to-frame clarity by creating storyboards for different scenarios.  In addition, to explore the emotional beats of a narrative, you will create lighting and color keys.  In the final weeks, we will create a finished production illustration for a narrative that will be either supplied or created by the student.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors sophomore and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLDSMITH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As visual artists, we all have a story to tell.  &lt;BR&gt; One of the keys to creating a convincing narrative is persuading your viewers of the believability of the world into which you invite them. The creation of graphic novels, games, animations, movies and theater sets often start with a world guide - a document that fully describes the setting. Sometimes these are simply textual or visual references and sometimes they are books in their own right; but regardless of form, their purpose is to make sure that all the creative people working on a project will build a consistent "reality".  &lt;BR&gt; This course is intended to familiarize students with the process of generating and illustrating the visual parameters of an invented environment in which a story happens - defining first the umbrella under which the story unfolds, then establishing a more particular space/time/habitat  that includes anything relevant to the story: environment, history, culture, clothing styles, architecture, animals, etc.  &lt;BR&gt; Beyond the invention of a setting for a visual narrative, in this course students will also learn how to design a style guide for intellectual property worlds (IP). Each will create a visual "bible" for envisioning their IP world-a document that clearly defines and describes the world within which the narrative unfolds.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE HUMAN FIGURE IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will learn to depict the human figure more effectively within a spatial and compositional context. The classical principles of pictorial design emphasized in the course will enable students to create compelling and visually dynamic work. These principles strengthen visual unity by strategically repeating various formal elements within an image while contrasting those elements in order to provide a sense of balance.   Master works by Diebenkorn, Cassatt, Sorolla, Hopper, Degas, and Vermeer, among others, will be analyzed in order to gain insight from their compositions and use of color. Students will execute several small-- scale master studies to assimilate those lessons more deeply.   Students will also explore the narrative potential of the human figure in context as they develop personal imagery. Sources for such imagery will be chosen by each student and may include observation, imagination, memory, photo reference or any combination thereof. Students may work in any color or monochromatic 2-D medium - drawing, painting, collage, mixed media, or digital - based on individual preference and expressive need.  During each class, students will have the option to work from direct observation of human figures placed in environments. The models will be set in long poses to allow time for compositional and narrative ideas to develop. Students may also use class time to develop their own imagery from non-observational sources. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective. &lt;BR&gt;Open to all students; sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will be open to students from across departments/divisions as an interdisciplinary journey, engaging in visualizing and articulating the narrative of Monkey-A Kung Fu Puppet Opera.  Based on a thousand year-old Chinese quest saga and given new life through a multitude of Bunraku style puppets, both life sized and hand held, this interdisciplinary course will bring students with a variety of talents and visions together to translate and envision a performance based narrative through drawing, constructing and performing. In addition to the research, ideation process and narrative exploration/visualization, students will construct the puppets, design their costumes, learn the artistry of movement and performance and engage in a dialogue with the choreographer to explore the movement and action through practice performance and storyboarding.  The students in this course will have to work collaboratively to create the final rendition of the three major puppet characters in designated teams of production.  Artistic collaboration is a central element of performance based art, and will be a center piece for this course.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course will be cross-listed in both Illustration (ILLUS) and Interdisciplinary Studies (IDISC), with consultation and guest visits from Apparel Design and Textiles faculty as well as  external collaborators from White Snake Productions and Puppet Director Tom Lee.  The faculty and student production team, and the Pulitzer prize-winning librettist, Cerise Jacobs, will engage in a regular dialogue with the students as they facilitate the creation of the project. The end result of the work created in the classroom will culminate in a series of performances of the opera on the professional stage in the Fall of 2021. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as IDISC-4102; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Areas of study will include an examination of design related issues that will be studied in the context of their social, political, technological, and economic circumstances, as they pertain to the design culture of the period. Special emphasis will be given to the history of interior interventions, additions and renovations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt; Other areas of study will include the development of architectural drawing and other presentation media, and the way in which designs often evolved through committees, or ongoing consultations among the patrons, designers, administrators, and scholars. Attention will also be given to design theory, and the doctrines relating to site, orientation, proportion, decorum, and the commercial design market.&lt;BR&gt; A general background in the history of art and design is desirable but is not mandatory. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement: BFA&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit.&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class is primarily intended as a means for students in their year of graduation from the Department to prepare their portfolios for interviews with potential employers and for entry to the professional world of design.  Using computer programs which will build upon knowledge already gained, the course will be helpful to all those who wish to gain some knowledge of techniques which will enhance the presentation of design work already completed.  This is an essential aspect of the class, and should not be regarded as an opportunity to extend further design work on earlier studios, although some refinement of existing drawings will be necessary. InDesign, Illustrator &amp; Photoshop software required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduating Interior Architecture majors only.&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE FOR NON-MAJORS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is primarily intended to provide some insight into the design objectives of the studio projects of the undergraduate and graduate degree programs of Interior Architecture at RISD.  As a studio introduction to Interior Architecture for non-majors, the course will focus on the spatial design concerns of the department focusing on how one carves, creates and occupies built space. Projects will explore the realm of work that begins with an architectural volume and transforms it from the ill-used or obsolete, to new purpose and viability, presented in drawings and models. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is devoted to developing one's abilities to write and speak with precision and complexity, about one's own work and the work of others. We will examine trends and movements in contemporary art through the lens of critical theory. We will investigate what contemporary art can tell us about the relationships between history, images, and visual culture, subsequently developing the skills necessary to write about your work, what it articulates and argues, and the ideas and traditions from which it emerges. Each term will identify and address a new set of themes relevant to course content. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COPPER, COLOR, KILN, COLLECTION: ENAMELED JEWELRY AS SERIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Enamel has been used as a medium for color and image for millenia. This course will teach students the art of enameling, or glass fused to metal, as a method for creating a unified series of jewelry. Beginning with the basic technique of sifting solid colors onto copper, you will learn a range of common techniques throughout the semester, including grisaille, cloisonn, champlev, and painting enamels, in addition to basic jewelry techniques. With each new technique, students will complete samples in order to practice and become comfortable before moving on to creative projects which will incorporate multiple techniques. Rather than simply treating enameled pieces as gemstones or imagery, as was often done in ancient times, students are expected to think about the techniques in a contemporary context and use enamel in experimental ways. Enamel is an opportunity to add color to an often monochromatic medium. This course will not only equip students with the skills to make enameled jewelry, but enhance their ability to create cohesive bodies of work in their own artistic practices.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTING: ADORNMENT AND CRIME</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Lost-Wax Casting is one of the world's oldest metal working processes and has a complicated and interwoven history with the development of human civilization. Through a series of prompts students will learn and explore the process of lost-wax metal casting, various mold-making techniques, and jewelry-making processes. In relationship to the crafting of wearable works of art, students will respond to a series of short readings and listenings that will provide different historical and contemporary perspectives to objects and their cultural impact.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will teach students to consider the conceptual and formal aspects involved in crafting wearable jewelry. In tandem with technical processes, students will also critically address the conceptual language imbedded in making adornment and ornamentation. Students will be supported to make work that applies to their independent major or research interests and required to participate in discussions on readings, writings, and during critiques. Readings and listening's on Adolf Loos, Michael Foucault, and others will be given to further explore the prompted assignments.    &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BODY AND THE EXTENDED BEYOND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>These days the boundaries between the human body and technology shift and blur; we merge more and more with the technology we create. In The Body and the Extended Beyond, students will research relational inter-actions and the interdependency between our fragile human bodies and technological surroundings. We will look for juxtapositions and parallels between the organic and the artificial, focus on spaces in-between the two and examine the core of objects and the context in which they are situated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Instruction focuses on individualized guidance to develop personal perspectives and conceptual frameworks. Group discussion and processes such as mind mapping and material research will fuel our intellectual and aesthetic research. Throughout the course each student will produce a series of works that reflects their thinking and making process.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUBLISHING JEWELRY: THE POST-DIGITAL YOU</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As we enter the second decade of the new millennium, the hybridization of physical and virtual realities continues to grow exponent ially. The irl and url spaces become less and less distinguishable. We make our work in the studio, but the output of that work - its representation through image and language -  morphs to exist in new realms . It now populates a myriad of creative formats and exists on printed and web-based pages alike. New social media formats favor small -scale design and craft -based objects, jewelry included. Accessibility to work is further democratized while at the same time attention spans dwindle. How will you frame your work with only a second to grab someone's attention? What do you have to say when communicative space is extremely limited? As in the phenomenon of memes, context and conciseness are key to proliferation. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Co-taught by Kellie Riggs ( jewelry curator and writer) and Jose Menendez (graphic designer, landscape designer, and visualization scientist } THE POST DIGITAL YOU will explore aspects of the students' identity, their relationship to the post -digital era, and how they see their work contextualized within it. Exercises emphasize two cross-linked themes: the value of short -format writing as a means to create new relevancies for the student's work, online or offline; and visual communication strategies for post-digital publishing. This course culminates with the creation of a collaborative class publication.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRODUCTION RESEARCH STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A multi-faceted studio practice is increasingly necessary in the field of jewelry. Various modes of conceptualizing, designing, making, and marketing are common in contemporary practice. Nurturing these variegated practices allows for greater diversity in conceptual, formal, material, and consumer exploration. The introduction of production thinking as part of a hybrid practice demands new perspectives of process and the role of the user/viewer/consumer. This expanded field of view creates a critical feedback loop, influencing and enhancing overall studio practice.    This course will focus on the research, design, and creation of jewelry meant to be  efficiently produced as multiples. The course supports individualized research for the development and creation of a line of production jewelry influenced by market research, cost analysis, and production processes. Students will collaboratively explore various design methods to develop broad variation within a unifying design concept, and engage in critical discussions about formal design issues, production viability, and market appeal. Various aspects of the making of production work, including strategies for repetitive manual processes and outsourcing (3D printing, mold making, casting, laser cutting) will be researched, shared, discussed, and utilized when appropriate. The course culminates with a market aware, rigorously developed, thoughtfully designed, and well-made line of production jewelry.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective; Open to JM majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/i&gt;), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt; ), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like &lt;I&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt; Melancholia&lt;/I&gt; illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of &lt;I&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/I&gt; in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's &lt;I&gt;Shalimar the Clown&lt;/I&gt; or Bahman Ghobadi's &lt;I&gt;Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists&lt;/I&gt;, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's &lt;I&gt;The Submission&lt;/I&gt;, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's &lt;I&gt;Flight Behavior&lt;/I&gt;, Krakauer and Penn's &lt;I&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/I&gt;, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary &lt;I&gt;Gasland&lt;/I&gt;, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in &lt;I&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/I&gt;, and imaginary places in films like &lt;I&gt;After Life&lt;/I&gt; (Kore-eda Hirokazu), &lt;I&gt;Micmacs&lt;/I&gt; (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and &lt;I&gt;Marwencol&lt;/I&gt; (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMA AND NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have shaped contemporary media and culture in profound ways, including how we make, experience, and talk about art, design, commerce, and culture, bodies, identities, and communities, privacy, security, and war, time, space, and geography, and even the politics of meaning and "truth" themselves. In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENVIRONMENTAL COMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING POETRY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Beginning Poetry Workshop is an elective course introducing students to the art of poetry writing. The course sequentially addresses major commitments of poetry including form/content, sound, line, voice, image, language(s), tradition/convention, experiment, audience, revision, performance, collection, publication, and distribution. Workshop is the heart of the course, animating the practice, discourse, critique, audience, community, and mentorship vital to poets. Every class will also include close reading, discussion of assigned texts, and writing. We will attend public readings, curate and participate in community readings, and welcome poets to our class, when possible. Work can be developed in a range of styles, traditions, and languages. You will leave this class with a collection of workshopped and revised poems, which you will design, self-publish, and distribute in print and/or digital form.  &lt;BR&gt;The Beginning Poetry Workshop is a prerequisite for the LAS-E421 Advanced Poetry Workshop in the Spring. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A workshop-style course which combines English with a studio project for students with an interest in children's picture books.  Students will learn to develop storytelling skills (imagination, language, plot, character, and voice) and illustration techniques (characterization, setting, page, layout) by studying picture books and completing writing and illustration assignments.  For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Students must plan and register for both LAS-E416 and ILLUS-3612 and will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the vast, variegated field of critical theory. We will study the concepts, questions, and debates that have been central to understandings of modern culture. In order to do so, we will explore key contributions in psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonial studies. As we explore this wide range of approaches, we will interrogate how thinkers have imagined and reimagined terms like "art," "reading," "subjectivity," "modern," "discipline," "culture," "power," "technology," "sovereignty" and "nature," among others. And as we build this critical lexicon, we will examine the social institutions and intellectual formations that shape each debate. What kinds of knowledge does critical theory produce, and what are their blindspots? What forms of personhood and community do these theories outline, and in whose interests? What kinds of insights become visible when we examine conflicting theories together? Thinkers include Adorno, Agamben, Althusser, Barthes, Benjamin, Benveniste, Bhabha, Butler, Chow, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Freud, Gramsci, Hall, Haraway, Irigaray, Jameson, Lacan, Latour, Levi-Strauss, Lukacs, Marx, Ranciere, Said, Saussure, Spivak, Terranova, Willliams, and others. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE I: AFRICA, THE CARIBBEAN AND LATIN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Postcolonial literature is the writing produced by people in or from regions that have escaped the yoke of colonialism.  Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our reading will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America.  The spectre of slavery and its repercussions will reverberate in many of the readings.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or a book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them. Writers may include Chinua Achebe, Isabel Allende, Michelle Cliff, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, George Lamming, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Derek Walcott.</COURSEDESC>

In this course, we will undertake a creatively critical examination of several plays in the context of 16th- and 17th-century political struggles, major ideological shifts, colonial expansion, literary movements, and the cultural place of the commercial theatre as a new and controversial space of representation that vigorously appropriated traditional narratives.  Requirements for the course include regular short writing assignments, a modest research paper, a final examination, and attendance at a local theatrical production.  &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: BLACK WOMEN RUIN EVERYTHING: SLAVES, ALIENS AND GHOSTS IN PURSUIT OF A BETTER WORLD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is grounded in two premises. The first is that the world is founded on anti-blackness and the second is that black feminist authors write with an awareness of this fact and the desire to imagine this world otherwise. Focusing on works of speculative fiction such as Octavia Butler's Dawn and Toni Morrison's Beloved, as well as less easily classifiable texts such as Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters and Phyllis Alesia Perry's Stigmata, this course considers how the use of non-realist elements in realist (protest fiction and neo-slave narratives) and non-realist (such as afro-futurism) genres serve as important means of both critiquing the gendered anti-blackness that affects black women's life chances and imagining a future not predicated on simply enrolling black being in the existing hierarchies of human being. Put otherwise, this course will investigate how black feminist writers have used speculative fiction and/or elements of speculative fiction to attempt to image not only their own freedom but also the freedom of all beings arranged within the social and political hierarchies built upon their backs.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Literature is one facet of culture.  The significance of literature can be best understood in terms of the culture for which it springs, and the purpose is clear only when the reader understands and accepts the assumptions on which literature is based" (Paula Gunn Allen-Laguna Sioux poet). This course will explore value systems and aesthetics that are from very diverse Native cultures, focusing on the ways in which indigenousness relates to literature and storytelling. The critical methodologies developed by Native critics such as Gerald Vizenor  (Anishinaabe writer and scholar), and Craig Womack (Muscogee Creek-Cherokee author and professor of Native Studies) will enable us to study Native frameworks and new ways to regard literature/histories. We will explore questions such as can Native American theory/literature transform or challenge non-Native critical theoretical strategies. Our discussions, which may take a variety of directions, will also examine such issues as American Indian identities and communities as well as the impact of colonization on tribal peoples.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FAMILY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of &lt;I&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/I&gt; reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED POETRY WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Advanced Poetry Workshop is an intensive project-based poetry workshop for students with previous workshop experience and a portfolio of revised work on which to build. The course centers on workshop: peer critique by students with previous practice in poetry writing, and the shared goal of completing a semester-long publication/performance project. Students are expected to have a strong commitment to active participation in contemporary poetry as readers, writers, curators, performers, and audience. Teaching and learning methodologies include close reading of exemplary texts, experimentation with forms, revision, online/print publication, and performance. Texts will include poetry collections published in 2019 and 2020, as selected by students and instructor. The workshop welcomes work in any language and from any tradition of poetry. To the greatest extent possible, the work should speak for itself. But mediation, translation, contextualization also play a vital role.  &lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite: LAS-E411 Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop, or equivalent experience.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: LAS-E412: Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NATURAL HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar has two primary goals:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. To engage critically with natural history as a literary and visual art form and with its history as a scientific practice.  &lt;BR&gt; 2. To collaborate on projects and experiments that employ digital and analog methods for analyzing, interpreting, archiving, curating, and creating visual and literary works of natural history. Throughout the semester, we will visit local museums, labs, archives, and field sites to facilitate these goals.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Natural history is a crucial genre for understanding the origins of modern environmentalism, the history of science, discourses of race, and the nature of European imperialism. As an artistic and epistemological practice, natural history enjoyed the height of its popularity during the early modern and enlightenment periods, as European explorers, traders, and colonizers endeavored to classify, catalog, explain, and exploit the diverse flora and fauna all over the planet. In the process, they encountered (and often ignored or stole from) the complex folk biology of various indigenous cultures. Especially in the Americas, natural historical knowledge production depended on the collaboration of various cultures within profoundly uneven power dynamics: European explorers and creolized American naturalists, political leaders and ordinary citizens, amateur collectors and professional theorists, men and women, slaveholders and enslaved people, and Euro-colonial traders and indigenous Americans. Furthermore, early naturalists were polymaths --scientists, philosophers, political leaders, artists, writers, collectors, and traders --before the stratification of the modern sciences into disciplines that took place during the nineteenth century. As science became a more professional and specialized endeavor, natural history evolved into various forms of amateur field science, environmental art, and nature writing, an evolution this course will actively examine through reading, conversation, and practice. As such, our course materials will range from classical antiquity to the present and cover a large variety of written forms and artistic mediums.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL ENGLISHES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar attempts to do two things: first, we examine the global careers of the English language and the literatures written in it from their period of ascendance during the height of British colonialism in the late-19th century to their proliferation in the postcolonial present to argue for a concept of multiple "Englishes" in place of one dominant, normative, authentic 'English';second, we explore the hypothesis that the discourse of "Global Englishes" is not just constituted in writing and literature as most scholars have argued but also through everyday performance, and often through spoken forms. So, a discussion of the cultural politics of speaking and listening across different sonic media will supplement the regular study of selected fiction, nonfiction, plays, poetry, films, television, and music. Topics discussed will include variations in the uses of literary English, translations and adaptations, varieties of spoken Englishes, accents and code-switching, multilingualism in literary texts, etc. Historical and theoretical contexts will include colonialism and postcolonialism, economic and cultural globalization, identity politics, exile and migration, literary prizes, circulation and readership, etc. Not surprisingly, most of the authors we will read are from ex-colonies of the British Empire which now have thriving English language literary and cultural traditions of their own, like India and Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa, Canada and Australia, Ireland and the Caribbean region. Since the United Kingdom's and the United States' Englishes, even though dominant, are still part of 'the global' we will read some representative texts from Scotland or Wales, for instance, as well as "US ethnic literatures." Authors may include Rudyard Kipling, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, G V Desani, Salman Rushdie, J M Coetzee, Jean Rhys, Wole Soyinka, Michle Lalonde, Derek Walcott, Brian Friel, Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Mohsin Hamid, M.

   <COURSETITLE>IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE: ALIENS IN SCIENCE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There are few things that represent the non-human better than the alien. Not of this world, often not even humanoid, the alien serves as the ultimate Other-something that does not belong, something that is different in a fundamental way, something that is often unknowable, something completely and utterly foreign. Gary Westfahl writes that "aliens are both metaphors and real possibilities" (16). As fundamentally non-human, though sometimes humanoid, the alien acts as a mirror to humanity, showing us the best, though more often, the worst of our own impulses. Aliens can be used to look inward, to probe the nature of humanity and thereby illustrate and comment upon human impulses, morals, and values. However, the ubiquity of aliens across media demonstrate that "humans also crave companionship in a vast, cold universe and aliens may represent hopeful, compensatory images of the strange friends we have been unable to find" (Westfahl 16). Symbolically, this plays out in a number of ways. The alien might represent an Other based on gender, sexuality, or race. The alien might be friendly, here to help mankind, opportunistic, here to plunder our natural resources, or downright evil, bent on eating, incubating in, or wiping out our civilization. This class will examine a number of Science Fiction works that feature aliens, from Octavia Butler, H.G. Wells, and C.J. Cherryh, to films by Ridley Scott, Steven Speilberg, and Neill Blomkamp. We will also draw on a number of theoretical authors, from Barbara Creed and Julia Kristeva, to Gary Westfahl and Darko Suvin. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; LAS-E101 is prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: WOMEN'S RESISTANCE ACROSS THE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores roles women have played in wars for independence and democracy across the Global South.  As the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo depicts in his iconic film, The Battle of Algiers (1966), some women fought alongside men carrying bombs in the fight for freedom from French imperialism in Algeria. However, more often, women have forged their own paths parallel to men enacting complex forms of resistance through art, mobilizing domesticity, and protest. Using women's participation in Algerian independence in the 1950s as our starting point, we will engage with women who resist the reductive fantasy of the bomb-carrying female freedom fighter throughout world. Figures under our investigative lens will include Assia Djebar who illustrates women playing new roles outside of the home in Algeria; women who led the peacemaking process in Liberia to bring Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to power; and Lina Ben Mhenni who used social media in Tunisia to show the world injustice taking place under a repressive regime in 2010. Alongside these memoirs, literary texts, historical documents, and films by and about women at war, we will develop a critical vocabulary of women at work reading theorists that include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler. Over the course of the semester, we will put these voices in conversation with one another in order to reconstruct alternative histories of resisting oppression in the Global South and beyond.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ECOLOGICAL INVENTION IN EARLY AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How can looking back to early America help us think and act in our present age of ecological crisis? In this course, we will explore the roots of American ideas about nature, environmentalism, and ecology in early American literature, beginning in the pre-colonial era and ending in the late nineteenth century. In the process, we will study the wide-ranging ecological views of indigenous Americans, Euro-colonial unsettlers of North America, enslaved and emancipated African transplants, and the various inhabitants of the United States in its first century as a nation state. In particular, we will examine how the confluence of various cultures influenced ideas about the conservation and exploitation of the natural world to varying degrees. To do so, we will ask how early American environmental writers defined nature and what these definitions included and excluded. To what degree did human dominion over the natural world and its resources extend? Was America a place for farmer-settlers or backwoods hunters and traders? Was its vast wilderness a refuge for religious worship or the devil's territory? Were humans part of nature or distinct from it, and which people counted as fully human? Was slavery considered a natural or unnatural state? Were animals considered reasoning subjects, instinctual objects of scientific study, or merely animate natural resources? Along the way, we will also ask how nature writing developed as its own multimedia genre during the period, as well as how it influenced various other genres of imaginative literature.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEFORE AND AFTER "MAN": OBJECTS, ANIMALS, SEX, AND RACE IN GENRES OF THE POST-HUMAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the human as a temporally specific and, perhaps, obsolescing philosophical concept. Emerging most cogently in the European Enlightenment, humans materialize as the center of their own concerns, i.e. humanism, through a set of binary oppositions that include human/god, human/animal, human/savage, hu(man)/woman, human/machine, subject/object etc. Post-humanism, broadly conceived, seeks to mark, blur, upend, and/or abolish the distinction or relationship between the opposed terms of these binaries. This course begins by attempting to account for how the human/Man came to prominence during the economic, social and geopolitical conditions of the 17th and 18th century in order to understand the threads of thought that contemporary genres of Post-humanisms attempt to unravel: such as animal studies, object oriented ontology, AI studies, and feminist and black studies in the subject of "Man." The course then turns to these various subgenres in order to think through post-humanism's ethical, political, and social stakes in our contemporary moment.</COURSEDESC>

Students in this course will be asked to: rehearse and perform assigned roles; accept assigned duties on graphic, projection and property/costume design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters and original work. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements.

   <COURSETITLE>TRUE CRIME</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Crime is terribly revealing," Agatha Christie wrote in her 1936 novel "The ABC Murders." In the genre known as "True Crime" - which, unlike Christie's novels, deals with real events -- there is a long and colorful history of examining crimes to see what, exactly, they reveal. This class is an introduction to this genre through classic texts (Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood", the Library of America's True Crime anthology), texts that challenge conventions (Rick Geary's graphic novel, "The Borden Tragedy"; Moises Kaufman's stage play, "The Laramie Project"), and texts that spill over in other media, including documentary film, television, radio, and photography.  Over the course of the term, students will not only become familiar with most famous crimes in American history -- recognizable by names like Manson and "O.J." -- but they will also explore the role crime plays in the history of a state that some call "Rogue's Island." Most importantly, the course is an opportunity for students to wrestle with the questions that the best True Crime stories pose. What is a crime? What is justice? And why are we perennially drawn to these stories?</COURSEDESC>

We will trace this development from the historical cinematic 1990s of New Queer Cinema (NQC), an era that encompasses an explosion of "gay film visibility," to an exploration of present day queer cinema and the ways in which queer representations and queer identities are portrayed. We will study the stylistic developments and controversies of queer film, examining major innovations and changes as compared to films from the NQC era. Such questions as what's at stake in films that contest and re-imagine new queer subjectivities will be addressed during the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHORT STORY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this writing workshop, we will explore the short story form, working to put into words what we--as individual readers--hope to find in it. We will consider what makes a story a story, while acknowledging that it is often something ineffable, indefinable. We will read from a range of contemporary and classic writers and will also read essays on craft. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to peer workshops. At the end of the term, students will be expected to submit a portfolio comprised of reflections, writing exercises, and completed stories.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We explore both narrative and nonfiction films and videotapes.  We write essays to establish critical standards.  We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE FICTION OF COLSON WHITEHEAD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In 2016, Colson Whitehead's &lt;I&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/I&gt; won the National Book Award and was selected for Oprah's Book Club-a pair of honors that bespeaks the critical recognition and popular appeal of his work. Since his debut novel, &lt;I&gt;The Intuitionist&lt;/I&gt; (1999), the hallmark of Whitehead's fiction has been the way in which it bridges between "highbrow" and popular culture, from noir to advertising to zombies. In this course we will consider these collisions of literary form and generic fiction, and specifically how Whitehead uses them to confront deep-rooted narratives of progress, race, and enterprise in America. Readings will include several of Whitehead's novels - &lt;I&gt;The Intuitionist, John Henry Days, Apex Hides the Hurt, Zone One, and The Underground Railroad &lt;/I&gt;- and a sampling of his essays, articles, and tweets. Students will produce several short written exercises and one final mixed-media or multi-media project that they develop over the duration of the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUNK CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the punk-new wave musical revolution was brewing in the mid 1970s, underground filmmakers were also embracing the punk spirit of experimentation, a do-it-yourself ethos, and an uneasy, often defiant relationship with all things authoritative or mainstream. This course will trace and map the contours of punk cinema, from its roots in neorealism and the French New Wave, to its branches in the No Wave and Cinema of Transgression movements of the early 1980s. Time permitting, we?ll look forward to the post-punk era to consider how the legacy of punk informs later film movements such as Dogme 95.  Directors we?ll encounter may include: Amos Poe, Alex Cox, Derek Jarman, Slava Tsukerman, Lars von Trier, and Penelope Spheeris. While not a prerequisite, some background in critical film theory will be beneficial in this course, as will a commitment to academic reading, writing, and lively discussion.</COURSEDESC>

It's a time of both/and rather than either/or. We will discuss and write about a range of contemporary print, digital, and performance works; students will also compose and publish/perform at least one single-authored or collaborative poem. Contemporary Poetry is one of a set of multimodal courses including Sound Poetry, Visual Poetry, Digital Poetics, and Material Poetics, investigating sensory and material poetic traditions in contemporary culture.

   <COURSETITLE>COLORIZING FILM/EMBODYING CINEMA: TRADITION OF BLACK WOMEN FILMMAKERS IN THE USA: 1970 FF</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> "In every generation and in every intellectual sphere and in every political moment, there have been African American women who have articulated the need to think and talk about race through a lens that looks at gender, or think and talk about feminism through a lens that looks at race. So this is in continuity with that."  --Kimberl Crenshaw                      "I really didn't let gender and race issues bother me. I knew I would have trouble with both. I was determined to do what I was going to do at any cost. I kept plugging away. Whatever I had to do, I did it." --Madeline Anderson, from Reel Black Talk This course will be an intense and focused examination of Black Women's film-making in the USA beginning with the 1970's LA Rebellion/UCLA Rebellion of Black Filmmakers through contemporary work.  The critical journey will include Black feminist &amp; womanist political theories, Black Feminist manifestos, histories of black women filmmakers and traditional film theory &amp; Black film aesthetic theories.  We will consider Black women's documentary tradition, their relation to and gendered representation of African-American to African heritage; and intersectional POV of race, gender, sexuality, and class. We will analyze form, content and theoretical interventions in order to sketch, if not fill in, an artistic, cultural, and political practice that remains in the literal shadows of Hollywood and White film hegemony. You MUST be prepared to screen many films, read critical and theoretical essays, and write thoughtful, cogent papers that will help us center a space that is too often decentered.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS-C221; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;Br&gt; LAS-E101 is a prerequisite if taken for LAS credit. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINESE CINEMA: QUESTIONS OF NATIONALISM, REALISM, AND FILM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore Chinese Cinema as a national cinema and as a transnational cinema in both its popular and classic forms; however, the term 'Chinese' has been and is still a debated term among the very populations that lay claim to it, i.e., mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chinese diaspora, the People's Republic. These debates make the study of Chinese film a study of how to categorize or know film itself. In other words, exploring Chinese film in a Western critical arena within the hegemony of Western film studies begs theoretical questions about the very dominant and commonplace terms and perspectives used to examine all film in the 21st century, i.e, What are these films showing us?  What are we looking for?  What do we see?  Investigating these theoretical quandaries will also be a part of this course.  We will survey representative films produced before 1949, during the shift from of the cultural capital from Yan'an to Shanghai 1950-1964, during the Cultural Revolution (1964-1986), and during its emergence as the premier transnational cinema (late-1980s to 2000s).  We will also consider the particular film genres and film schools of Chinese cinema. Students will be responsible for reading critical and theoretical essays, viewing all required films, writing analytical papers on assigned topics, and presenting one oral sequence analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL LITERARY MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the last decades, modernist studies has moved far beyond its initial focus on a group of male Anglo-American High Modernists writing between 1890 and 1940. What the field now refers to as modernisms encompass popular and elite forms alike, some emphasizing stylistic form and others not, authored by men and women of diverse racial and national identities, class backgrounds, and political affiliations. Like modernity, which modernism is generally seen to respond to, modernism viewed on a global scale has appeared unevenly and irregularly across time and geographic space and thus defies periodization. This course will survey global literary modernisms from a comparative perspective, attending to how the notions of the world and the modern are engaged in texts by such authors as Charles Baudelaire (France), Joseph Conrad (England), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Anna Akhmatova (Russia), Constantine Cavafy (Greece), Rabindranath Tagore (India), Jean Rhys (Dominican Rep.), Nella Larsen (U.S.), Jorge Luiz Borges (Argentina), Aim Cesar (Martinique), Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar (Turkey), Eileen Chang (China), and others.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAGIC IN MODERN CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Stage magic, perhaps because it must conceal any record of its craft, is often neglected among the performing arts. Yet it exerts a powerful hold on our imaginations, and our language is peppered by its terms (prestige, enchanting, smoke and mirrors, pulling a rabbit out of a hat, etc). So what exactly is the allure of magic? What are its cultural functions? And what, in turn, can magic reveal about the fears or wishes of its audience? Through the lens of literature, anthropology, cultural and performance studies, this course will examine the history of magic in the modern world and its place in contemporary culture. We will consider the development of magic as an art form over the course of the 19th century, the dynamics of a magic trick, the bodily and cultural politics of magic performance, and the surprising prevalence of magic in contemporary literature, film, and commerce. Texts will include fiction by Steven Millhauser and Tim O'Brien, films by Orson Welles and Christopher Nolan, and a range of historical, theoretical, and archival materials. Students will complete several shorter essays and a longer researched paper. (No skill in prestidigitation required!)  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GENDER AND THE FAIRYTALE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We are all familiar with the moral of the story that comes at the end of a fairy tale. Charles Perrault's "Little Red Riding Hood" cautions unmarried young ladies not to let "wolves" into their beds, while the Grimm's "Little Red Cap" chastises girls for not listening closely to their mothers. Traditional versions of these tales are conduct manuals, cautionary tales, and homemaking primers for young girls, but they also address the underlying uncertainties associated with growing up and entering adulthood. Over the years, the fairy tale has been retold or reimagined to reflect shifting gender norms, and changing cultural anxieties around the transition to adulthood. Most recently, adaptations on the large and small screens have asked us to consider the motivations of the fairy tale's most notorious female villains in the context of traditional gender roles such as wife and mother. This course will examine tellings and retellings of four classic fairy tales: Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty and Bluebeard. We will read and watch classic versions, contemporary retellings, and film and television adaptations of these texts that both challenge and reinforce ideas of gender normativity, contextualized by readings in feminist theory, gender studies, and psychoanalytic theory. We will also put these western tales in conversation with other similar literary texts and folk tales from around the world, and yes, we will talk about Disney.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Kiki (n): A party including good music and good friends, held for the express purpose of calming nerves, reducing anxiety and stress and generally fighting ennui. May involve locked doors, tea and salacious gossip. This course is based on the premise that LGBT history is told through conversations about and descriptions of spaces. We will use novels, stories, poems, films, and theory to investigate how queer spaces are required to serve multiple often contradictory functions-queer bars are for drinking but also seeking healthcare resources; queer neighborhoods provide a much-needed sense of belonging while also fomenting gossip, judgmental cliques, and gentrification. The definition of the word "kiki" implies that these contradictions speak to a culturally acquired experience of anxiety and nervousness. Guiding our exploration of this anxiety will be queer theory and gender studies addressing the tension between sexual acts and identity, the closet, homophobia and transphobia, intersectionality, and queer of color critique. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEFORE AND AFTER "MAN": OBJECTS, ANIMALS, SEX, AND RACE IN GENRES OF THE POST-HUMAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the human as a temporally specific and, perhaps, obsolescing philosophical concept. Emerging most cogently in the European Enlightenment, humans materialize as the center of their own concerns, i.e. humanism, through a set of binary oppositions that include human/god, human/animal, human/savage, hu(man)/woman, human/machine, subject/object etc. Post-humanism, broadly conceived, seeks to mark, blur, upend, and/or abolish the distinction or relationship between the opposed terms of these binaries. This course begins by attempting to account for how the human/Man came to prominence during the economic, social and geopolitical conditions of the 17th and 18th century in order to understand the threads of thought that contemporary genres of Post-humanisms attempt to unravel: such as animal studies, object oriented ontology, AI studies, and feminist and black studies in the subject of "Man." The course then turns to these various subgenres in order to think through post-humanism's ethical, political, and social stakes in our contemporary moment.</COURSEDESC>

In this course, students become familiar with the vocabulary and narrative forms associated with distinct strains of thought about addiction. The readings consist of fiction, film, and life writing from the early 19th Century to the 21st Century, and consider how models of addiction-moral, medical, and more-both develop chronologically and recur. Authors studied may include Thomas DeQuincey, George Eliot, Edgar Allan Poe, Jean Stafford, James Baldwin, Mary Gaitskill, Suzan-Lori Parks, Danny Boyle, and Augusten Burroughs. Students write a series of short essays as well as a longer final project that combines critical analysis and life writing.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLACK HEROES, SUPERHEROES, AND MUTANTS FROM THE 60S TO TODAY: REPRESENTATIONS AND METAPHOR FOR BLACKNESS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Launched originally as Timely Comics in 1939, Marvel Comics has always reflected, commented on, and shaped the real world. This course will focus on Marvel Comics creation of visually black hero and  superheroes as well as metaphors for blackness during the Black Civil Rights/ Black Power Movements-specifically Luke Cage, Black Panther, and the X-Men, -in order to consider how Marvel mobilized the racial and colonial unrest of the period to imagine and in some cases imaginatively contain trajectories of black political insurgency. Because all three of these figures/comic books have re-emerged over the last several years, after attempting to understand the work as original construction in its original context, we will look at Marvel's contemporary filmic articulations of blackness to consider whether they represent the same or different projects regarding race and colonialism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;But what I write and how I write is done in order to save my own life. And I mean that literally. For me literature is a way of knowing that I am not hallucinating, that whatever I feel/know is.&lt;/I&gt; &lt;br&gt;  -Barbara Christian: The Race For Theory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DARK MATTER: AN INTRODUCTION TO RACE, GENDER, AND SPECULATIVE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Greg Tate has said that "Black people live the estrangement that science fiction writers imagine." This course takes up the nexus of intersections between black history and the radical black imagination that is commonly called Afrofuturism, focusing in particular on figurations of Africa as a space of science fictional possibility from both sides of the Atlantic. If Afrofuturism has been, as Kodwo Eshun has said, "a program for recovering the histories of counter-futures created in a century hostile to Afrodiasporic projection," how do these writers, filmmakers and artists of the African diaspora reshape the very definition of who and/or what qualifies as human? What can these visions tell us about living in a black body in the present? How can Afrofuturism be used to critique racial asymmetries in the present and to imagine as-yet-unrealized, free black futures? From literature to film to music to art we will trace Afrofuturism across the twenty-first century cultural landscape. Using Afrofuturism, critical race studies, and queer theory, we will investigate the ways that science fiction's disruption of race, gender, and sexuality as stable categories offers radical models for our present and possible futures.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein is often heralded as the first science fiction novel. A chilling tale of a scientist who creates life, the mythos of Frankenstein and his monster continues to fascinate modern audiences. This course will examine Shelley's Frankenstein and the subsequent works inspired by her tale. We will draw from a wide range of Frankenstein-inspired works, from the camp horror of "Herbert West-Reanimator," the comedy of Mel Brooks, and the time traveling of Frankenstein Unbound, to the overt social commentary of Frankenstein (2015), the fantasy recuperation of I, Frankenstein, and the prolific presence of the pop-cultural Frankenstein's monster. Using a wide range of theoretical works examining monsters and the monstrous, this class will attempt to explain and understand the timeless draw of Shelley's creation.</COURSEDESC>

The course will supplement these readings with selections from Irish cinema, from Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan to Roddy Doyle, Terry George, Alan Parker, Michael McDonagh and recent documentary work from Ireland, as well as a discussion of the Republican muralist tradition as street drama.  Students will engage these texts through analysis, discussion, and short essays, culminating in a longer essay to more fully explore central issues and cap the course.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course, taught by a working professional actor/director with experience in stage, radio, tv and film, is centered on the belief that speaking skillfully in public is a way to self-discovery, self-improvement and self-confidence.  It is also a tenet of this course that skillful public speaking is a fundamental element of a humane society.  Students will deliver five major speeches, including self-written speeches of introduction, ceremonial speeches, informative speeches and persuasive speeches.  The oral interpretation of literature will also be explored.  Each class meeting will require every student's speaking participation in order to develop skills in the areas of voice, diction, managing speech anxiety, research and organization, use of microphones and video, and use of visual aids.  The latter phase of this course will focus on concentration, credibility, and familiarity with argument, debate and parliamentary procedure.  Attendance at each class is vital and mandatory; furthermore, students will be required to "dress up" for their presentations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POST-WAR AMERICAN LITERATURE: NARRATING COUNTERCULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will focus on the literary expression of American counterculture during the 1950s and 60s the so-called 'Beat' and 'Hippie' generations. The writers, artists, musicians, and bohemians who gave voice to counterculture during these two decades impacted not only literature and art, but also revolutionized social and political ideologies.  Their emphasis on individual freedom, spiritual liberation, and subcultural hipness, called on all Americans to define their "authentic" selves, to seek higher consciousnesses, and to resist the establishment's repressive mandate that we remain passive consumers rather than active creators. With literature as our guide, we'll begin by examining the Beat movement with its emphasis on spontaneity and the search for 'ITO' we'll then look at how Beat aesthetics and ideologies were adopted and politicized during the heyday of the Hippie movement; finally, we'll consider the impact of these earlier generations on later countercultural movements such as the Punks of the 70s and early 80s.  In the course of our reading, we'll consider the impact of cultural contexts and political motivations on the literature: the Cold War; McCarthyism; the rise of mass consumer culture and mass media; the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements; and shifting politics around gender and sexuality.  We'll also investigate how members of those groups already on the margins of dominant socio-political discourse-women, racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities-relate to the notion of counterculture.  Expect readings from Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Amiri Baraka, James Baldwin, Sylvia Plath, Tom Wolfe, Joseph Heller, Jim Carroll, Aaron Cometbus, and Hunter S. Thompson. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In focusing on issues related to identity, "culture," ethics, human rights, justice, and knowledge construction narrated by these fictions, we will examine carefully, for example, the figure of the spy or detective as outsider to and observer of society as well as, in the works at issue here, frequently an immigrant or cultural or social "other." In the process, we will also engage questions central to reading, interpreting, and comparing fiction in a global context.</COURSEDESC>

However, our reading list will also include short stories, essays, and selections from her published letters and diaries. In particular, students can expect to become skilled readers of the stream of consciousness style of narration that characterizes Woolf's fiction and to engage with themes that run through much of her writing such as the creative process, modern subjectivity, sexuality, gender, domestic space, and war.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MATERIAL ASSEMBLIES: DETAILS AND CONSTRUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar addresses advanced problems in landscape construction, materials, and site engineering. In this class, students will be asked to apply their knowledge of landscape technologies and materials gained from earlier classes into an abbreviated technical drawing set. Through the drawing set, students will gain an understanding of the different stages of design including; concept development, schematic design, design development, and construction documentation. This project will become the basis for understanding the how details and materials develop and change throughout the pre-construction process. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Landscape is a term that can refer to a specific locale, design, or a collection of ideas. The term usually implies a system of interrelated cultural and natural forces operating within a context of a defined scale or disciplinary boundaries.  In this course we examine and discuss the foundational definitions of the term landscape and the theoretical stances that are active in the creation of contemporary landscape architecture, land art and other creative disciplines. Writing assignments will be based upon fundamental texts, direct experience, and contemporary projects. Weekly readings will be discussed and diagrammed in class for content and structure. Students will produce a series of  five short (2 to 3 page) analytical essays and case studies. There will be weekly discussion sections with course TAs to review readings, two field assignments, and one field trip to the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design  Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Open to qualified undergraduates and non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops the different levels of dexterity and control in the construction of architectural drawing. The pedagogy allows for students to build a basic understanding of orthographic drawing typologies and traditional drawing methods while preparing them for more complex hybridized drawing methods. A parallel segment of the course addresses freehand representation, developing observation and translation tools necessary to design. Through these multiple approaches, drawing is developed as a tool to transform conceptual ideas into tangible form. The class will be taught as a series of lectures that discuss both why and how we draw accompanied by skill building workshops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration. .&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do these words mean and what is their relationship to each other in the architectural design disciplines? Each word is packed with complex and evolving meanings that reflect the state of human knowledge about the environments in which we live and in which we intervene. Each word reflects our understanding of systems, physical, cultural and social, biotic and abiotic, as well as our aspirations to conserve, restore, or reshape those systems. Each word is ubiquitous in the contemporary quest to construct a sustainable, resilient future.  But do we really understand what they mean? Are they critically interdependent or can they be considered separately?&lt;br&gt; This studio will examine these questions with the twin objectives of establishing an evolving and dynamic understanding of the terms and generating working methods that respond to the complexities of scale encountered in the landscape.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This final core studio stresses large-scale and planning issues, complex sites, and urban conditions. The city is a living organism which evolves in a particular locale with a particular form due to a combination of environmental and cultural factors. These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux. This studio will explore these systems and the complex issues at play in our urban areas and the potential for positive change. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since it's creation over 100 years ago, landscape architecture has expanded beyond horticultural preoccupations to a discipline that engages natural, political and cultural systems to build ecological and social resilience.  This professional practice seminar explores contemporary practices of landscape architecture through the exploration of six current trends in practice: operating, researching, engaging, constructing, programming, and sustaining.  These topics are explored and discussed through student research initiatives, in-class lectures, readings, case study presentations from a wide range of practitioners, office visits, and site visits.  The goal of the course is to expose students to the variety of ways to practice landscape architecture today.  Students are encouraged to ask questions, bring their own experiences to class, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.  &lt;br&gt; Please see 2014 class blog for student content and writing samples: http://principlesofpractice2014.tumblr.com&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design  Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing. This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As the scope and objectives of the design disciplines expand and diversify, the ability to implement effective research methodologies has become  increasingly critical to position designers to generate and validate new knowledge. This course will survey research methods relevant to the design disciplines that have emerged from the sciences, the social sciences and the arts with special focus on those utilized by landscape architects.  Methods we will examine include case studies, descriptive strategies, classification schemes, interpretive strategies, evaluation and diagnosis, engaged action research, projective design and arts-based practices. Students will work individually and in teams to analyze and compare different research strategies, understand their procedures and sequences, the types of data required, projected outcomes, and value by examining a set of projects of diverse scales. Visiting lecturers will present  research based design projects. The goal of the course is to provide students with a framework of research methodologies with which they can begin to build their own research based practices.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by the Landscape Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVISIBLE LANDSCAPES &amp; ATMOSPHERIC DEVICES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Space in the environment is defined by a number of hidden climatic factors that we can feel, but cannot touch. These factors, such as light, temperature, wind, humidity, and sound, have spatial qualities that impact not only how space feels, but also how it is shaped. These factors are constantly changing and therefore define dynamic microclimates as they interact with physical elements in the environment. Computer simulations give us an idea of how these microclimates behave, but these visualizations lack the qualities of human experience, and ignore the way space is understood by a body moving through it. This class offers the opportunity for students to develop their own tools for sensing and visualizing microclimatic space in real-time, as it is perceived by the body. In order to develop these tools, students will be given an introduction to theories of sensory phenomena and environmental space, as well as methods of fieldwork and experiential drawing.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will also be a practical and conceptual exploration into electronic sensors, processors and actuators. Students will use microcontrollers to design their own atmospheric sensing tools, in order to reveal what are normally hidden qualities of the spatial environment. Open-source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with fundamentals of electronic circuitry. After an introduction to fundamentals, students will move through a process of planning, prototyping, and testing their instruments in the field and then refining before their final presentation. Students will present works-in-progress during class critiques to receive qualitative feedback from the class and instructors.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offerd as IDISC-3211; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Rhino will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;br&gt;Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIES OF NATURECULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to important authors, texts, topics, theories, and conversations in the environmental humanities. Students will carefully read and discuss a range of theoretical texts centered on questions of nature and the environment. Readings are likely to include eco-phenomenologies, thing theories, critical animal studies, slow violence, queer ecologies, and the geological turn, among other topics. The activity of close engagement with theoretical material will enable students to consider how texts encourage particular forms of comprehension and interaction with the environment, and to interrogate the intellectual and material consequences that accrue from particular ways of conceptualizing natureculture. As a required course in the first semester of the NCSS MA degree, the course creates a common vocabulary and experience for all NCSS MA students. The course can also be taken as a stand-alone seminar by non-major graduate students. Run as a seminar, students will engage in weekly discussions of course readings and complete regular writing assignments.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all graduate level students. &lt;BR&gt; For students enrolled in the MA in NCSS, NCSS-700G and NCSS-701G are co-requisites. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVENTIVE POLITICAL ECOLOGIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to important contemporary case studies and pressing global scenarios in the interdisciplinary field of nature-culture-sustainability studies.  Readings examine varied configurations of land, people, environment, animals, and climate across nations and cultures. Each week of the course engages with issues of difference and diversity. The course will be of interest to those researching forms of capitalism, economic and social inequality, gender relations, identity politics, human-animal studies, ethics, and political struggle in relationship to land, territory, environment, and urbanism. NCSS-702G expands, extends, and resituates the foundational theoretical texts studied in NCSS-700G by asking students to read authors who have applied the work of NCSS-700G authors as lenses for engaging and understanding issues of global importance. As a required course in the first semester of the NCSS MA degree, the course creates a common vocabulary and experience for all NCSS MA students. The course can also be taken as a stand - alone seminar by non-major graduate students. Run as a seminar, students will complete weekly readings, regular writing assignments, and will engage weekly in class discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to all graduate level students. &lt;br&gt; For students enrolled in the MA in NCSS, NCSS-702G and NCSS-703G are co-requisites. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REFUGEES, MIGRANTS AND DISPLACED PEOPLE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course looks at key issues relating to migration, displacement and asylum seeking in the world today. It frames these issues in terms of the circumstances that force movement and restrict the movement of people across national borders. It considers both the causes and consequences of such movements in relation to legal, political, economic, social and cultural factors. It looks at the images of citizen, nation and state that are constructed through the regulation of national borders, and compares these with the needs, goals, identities and cultural projects of the people who move or are moved across regulated borders. In working out how to think about people who live at the edge of conventional social science categories we will reconsider such basic concepts as ethnicity, identity, nation, culture and homeland. The course will involve a major research project on a refugee or migration situation of the students' own choosing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors, senirors and graduate students only.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FOODWAYS &amp; SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Mark Bittman has said, "If you look at the problems of healthy food and healthy agriculture in the United States, or healthy eating and healthy agriculture which are very closely related. You can't eat well unless you farm well, and you can't farm well unless the goal is providing good food for people." This course will look at the intersection of cultural eating practices and sustainable food production, not only in the United States, but also around the world. How can what we eat impact climate change? How do fair labor practices and social justice figure into sustainable food systems? What abandoned farming practices offer new ways of thinking today? Readings will include works by Wendell Berry, Jessica Harris, Saru Jayaraman, Wangari Maathai, Michael Pollan, Nadia Seremtakis, Pierre Thiam, and others. As a graduate seminar, this class will rely on class discussions and independent research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to graduate students only.   &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POST CARBON FUTURES: POLITICAL ECOLOGIES OF HOPE, SOLIDARITY AND POSSIBILITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore and critically interrogate the many ways through which low-carbon futures are currently being envisaged, advocated, promoted or contested. The discussion will be grounded in social /political theory and political ecology but we will range broadly exploring broader discussions in energy studies, architecture and design, cultural and policy studies to film and literature as they pertain to decarbonization. We will attend to key scientific and technical debates on decarbonization and wrestle with ongoing debates in energy studies. But the course will also be alert to the limits of what formal modelling and climate science can tell us about the future. As such the course will pay particular attention to the cultural and political imaginaries that are irreducibly entangled in contemporary scientific, socio-technical and socio-ecological debates and their consequences. In Post Carbon Futures students will debate the merits of green capitalist and post-capitalist, socio-centric and technocentric, Eurocentric and post-Eurocentric visions of the transition away from fossil fuels. We will examine a full range of low-carbon discourses: from technocentric ecomoderisms to eco-socialisms, eco-fatalisms to queer cyborg feminisms, degrowth and eco-militarism to indigenous futuring and environmental justice studies. The course will interrogate Northern discussions of the Green New Deal but also highlight perspectives from more marginalized perspectives from cosmopolitics to indigenous political ecologies. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Graduate Students only.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at the academy, the institution and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices and their cultural frameworks from the 1990s to the present. Frequent studio visits will occur and drive some of the reading and discussion. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective &lt;br&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING REFOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide variety of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting - but not its most traditional conventions. Encouraging idiosyncratic, individualistic art making with a heightened attention to the tactile nature of materials students will explore visual culture through informed readings and targeted artists. "Art supplies" will come from Home Depot and recycling as much as Utrecht and Blick. Employing the recycled, the found and gathered, the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning. Assignments will be introduced through the screening of classic Sci-Fi films that will act as a prompt for each project.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective; open to all majors.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; open to all majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY PREHISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, required for painting majors in spring semester of sophomore year, describes five defining features of modernity, providing the broad historical backdrop for their "invention": the individual, globalization, nature, industrialization, and abstraction. The first half of the class will be devoted to the visual art of varied geographic and cultural settings prior to and during the rise of these paradigms. The second half of the class slows to focus in greater detail on the high modernist manifestations of each of those themes (interiority, capital, environment, technology, and narrative), and uses them to contextualize the art and culture of the 20th century. Periods, places, and subjects will be introduced through secondary sources, providing a critical lens through which to connect the material to present day art, culture, politics, and experience (for instance, the rise of global trade will be seen through the lens of postcolonial theory). The material for the course ends at approximately 1989, setting the stage for a more in-depth look at contemporary art, culture, and criticism in their junior year course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore major requirement; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The second half of the class slows to focus in greater detail on the high modernist manifestations of each of those themes (interiority, capital, environment, technology, and narrative), and uses them to contextualize the art and culture of the 20th century. Periods, places, and subjects will be introduced through secondary sources, providing a critical lens through which to connect the material to present day art, culture, politics, and experience (for instance, the rise of global trade will be seen through the lens of postcolonial theory). The material for the course ends at approximately 1989, setting the stage for a more in-depth look at contemporary art, culture, and criticism in their junior year course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore major requirement; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be designed to develop confidence and experience with paint and painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques.

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While the majority of drawing takes place on mass-produced, white paper, the surface on which a drawing is created is an important aspect of a drawing's composition and meaning.  Color, texture, and materials of both surface and imagery all contribute to the final image. This course will focus on creating paper grounds as an integral part of the final composition. These grounds may even come to the forefront, evolving into distinct pieces that exist on their own.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This class will be split into two phases:  The first half of the class will be dedicated to the creation of paper grounds.  Students will explore the process of making paper from start to finish. In the creation of sheets, students will learn coloring, painting, and pouring with pulp.  Each sheet will become a unique composition, an original background or foreground.  During the second half of the class, students will explore making drawings on their individual grounds.  The relationship between imagery and surface will be consciously explored in order to develop multiple layers of meaning.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate cultural traditions of the "monster", broadly defined as an entity of horrific other-ness. Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a hands-on course, designed for advanced painting students who are fascinated by color, surface, transformation and alchemy, DIY processes, craftmanship, invention, and the stuff of paint. It is for those who are eager to dive deep into all sorts of materials, methods and techniques.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The objective of the class is to arm students with the tools and resources to figure out how to make what they imagine and to expand their practice through material exploration and information sharing. With an emphasis on experimentation, play, research and development; advanced students explore, problem solve and implement specific grounds, paints, supports, mediums and tools into their own practices.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The level of specialization and expertise students may eventually desire for their work could require seeking the advice of paint manufacturers, conservators, fabricators, other artists or even experts in other fields.  How to identify and acquire knowledge outside of one's comfort zone, approaching and finding a common terminology with peers and specialists is also a part of this course. Relevant art historical and contemporary methodologies, techniques and materials will be presented. Environmental Health and Safety guidelines that apply to painting practice and painting studio safety will be an integral part of this course. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSEDESC>In this class, we will consider historical conceptions of fact, fiction, and truth in painting ranging from the Pre-Raphaelites love of history and myth, to Modernist emphasis on fact, process and material. Through a series of prompts that involve processes of frottage, collage, sculpture, and painting, students will create works that approach the play between fact and fiction as a way to create meaning. Class discussions, projects, critiques will be supported by readings, lectures and demonstrations, as well as individual meetings. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>UNTITLED ABSTRACT 1</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will be studying the various avenues into abstract painting through observation. Students will explore the entrance into abstraction by building and conceptualizing space through examining our world and the objects we interact with. Through this manipulation of space, form and medium, students will have the chance to understand and find meaning in non-representational image making. Each week students will interact with an assemblage still life to use as an entry point into an abstract painting. Each week these still lifes will address unique challenges that painters engage with when making non-representational images. Landscape, reflection, light, figuration, flatness, texture and object making will all be themes that students will be faced with when working from these still lifes.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materails Cost: $125.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVESTIGATIVE DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The class will examine the various ways in which drawing can function as a tool for research and development for a studio practice. Such questions as how drawings are made and what drawings are for will be explored. Along with more conventional drawing some assignments will explore ideas of material processes as both a concept and as a practice in drawing. The class will be assignment driven in order to consider motives and teach tools for producing drawings that involve the mining of imagery as well as process-based approaches to drawing. In this class students will begin to develop a practice of drawing, but also a method to investigate meaning and/or content. The student may be called upon to supply their own research and subject matter, and to research themes and techniques being taught. The student is required to spend a minimum of 6 hours per week outside of class to be completely engaged in the course work. The Student will be expected to explore image making through assignments that push against the parameters of traditional tools, and marks, and other formal devices in order to invent with-in their studio practice. The objectives of this class will be openly explored in all media and materials, and consider new avenues for mark making. From charcoal to sculpture to video will be deployed help clarify the student's conceptual interests. Those with any experience or level of drawing, and an interest in applying a wider lens towards their practice are encouraged to join. Opening up to a wider lens of production, examination and discussion of artworks is a main intention in this course. The course will be supplemented with suggested reading, and individual presentations. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PATTERN AND SURFACEFOR PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this painting studio course we will expand the possibilities of how one can combine and use practices from textile design to make paintings. Students will become more sensitive to the symbols and semiotics of surfaces, fabrics, wallpapers, rugs, furniture and clothing that surround us. By learning to develop their own patterns and expanding color development skills, students will explore a variety of ways to imbue surfaces with meaning. Ultimately students at any skill level should leave this course with a better understanding of painting and a new way of thinking about conceptual development in any field they pursue.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will develop paintings through drawing assignments, collage, painting from life, visual research, and experiments with color. Studio work will be supplemented with critiques and lectures to help familiarize students at all levels with painting and textiles history. We will discuss the role of craft in fine art, and look at ways contemporary artists utilize or reject design as part of their painting practice. The course will culminate with students creating a series of paintings using their new techniques. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINT AND BECOMING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Paint and Becoming is a painting class that will supplement studio investigations with contemporary topics and writing in the fields of queer/trans theory. In this class, we will be investigating all the messy melodrama of paint: its potentials, its limitations, how paint changes and affects us as makers and viewers, and much more. We will each begin 10 paintings on the first day of class and work on them daily, knowing that they will completely transform by the end of Wintersession. Assignments will involve obstacles and conditions applied to these 10 paintings as they develop, on a group and individual level, culminating in one final painting to be started near the end of class. Outside of ongoing studio work, we will be reading and discussing selected writings by contemporary LGBT artists and thinkers on subjects of change, transformation, desire, material, visibility, and more. Each student's art practice will be nurtured through considerable faculty involvement and support through numerous individual and group critiques. There will be an examination of various strategies that fluctuate between specific in-class assignments and the students' individual work. The primary focus will be on the translation of in-class studio painting assignments into a thriving personal studio practice. Please note that this class must be supplemented with a self-directed studio commitment, and you must make time outside of our scheduled class meetings to create a significant amount of work. Assignments will be supplemented with instructor presentations, group critiques, selected readings and homework. Those with any level of painting experience are encouraged to join. Class time will be divided between studio time, individual meetings, and group discussions/critiques. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY &amp; RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does 'research' mean for contemporary photographers? For artists using photography within their practice? This hands-on studio course investigates and critiques the nature and scope of research and its practical application to current practice, and how research provides a critical context to help develop awareness, extend subject knowledge, and inform the creation of new artistic work. We will learn through current case studies, unpicking what kinds of processes photographers use when making work. We will investigate to what extent individual practices differ and what analogies can be drawn across those practices.  We will look at the roles of instinct and serendipity in allowing for other ideas to emerge. You will develop and hone your own research methods through a wide variety of experimental making and writing assignments, and through critique. This course is also a research project in itself, bringing together examples of photographic practice for you to ponder and engage into our own ideas, processes, and projects. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major as an elective. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Is it simply art with durational elements that unfold over the course of the work?  Is it art that depends on time to define itself? Is it art that can only exist within the confines of regulated space? Is it art that stands firmly in the aftermath of what preceded it? Is it art that keeps time, wastes time, witnesses time, changes time, rearranges time, or records time?  In this course, we will explore and welcome work being made under the broad umbrella of Time-Based work, such as: documentary photography, video art, experimental film, performance art, recorded happenings, social practice, and sculpture made with temporal dimensions.  The course will operate as a studio course, with students being asked to present work for critique regularly, as well as weekly discussions of historical and contemporary investigations and demonstrations of Time-Based art.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an introduction to photographic methods and ideas. Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression. &lt;BR&gt; Deposit: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Paris and its environs will be the catalyst for inspiring students of all levels of photography to begin or to continue to develop technical skills and to explore personal visions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In discussions on the work of past and contemporary photographers, in-group critiques which investigate "learning how to see" and how to create "good" photographs, and in individual meetings, students are encourage to respond in unique ways to photographic problems.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The class begins with the use of film and the black and white analog darkroom. Students are encouraged to have a 35mm SLR film camera or larger. Using film and the 35mm camera as the beginning tool for employing the visual language of art, students will process film and print in the well-appointed and maintained facility of the Photography Studies in France (Speos). Once everyone has worked in the darkroom, we will move onto working with digital cameras and it is hoped that students will have a DSLR. In support of the digital part of the class there will be classes in Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and a special class in creating a perfect file for output at a lab. The Speos building is located in the 11th arrondisement of Paris near the Bastille. In addition, field trips outside the city will introduce students to the countryside, as well as afford further photographic opportunities. The study of photography in Paris is sure to have an impact on the creative life of a student at any level of photography in immeasurable ways! &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.  A minimum gpa of 2.5 is required.  Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $5,315.00 - airfare not included.&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSETITLE>THE GENIUS OF PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is photography? What does it do, influence, affect, position, package, demand, suppress, communicate, radicalize? This course is designed to provide students entering the photography department with an overview of contemporary thinking and practice in lens-based media. It considers photography's impact on our culture and our lives. We need, use, and react to photographs in their many forms for many reasons: this is the spine of the course. Lectures, debates, in-class activities, and screenings will familiarize students with an expansive range of genres, working methods, subject/content, and critical issues relevant to contemporary practice. The focus of this course is on work produced within the last 30 to 40 years. Lectures are organized around major themes and approaches. Critical thinking and analysis of images will be encouraged through assignments that ask students to read and respond to photographs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Photo majors &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Photo Departent, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ASSEMBLE/CONSTRUCT: COLLECTING AS PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In what manner can one' s practice grow through collecting photographic imagery? How do found photographs impact one' s visual language? What and why do visual makers collect? In this seminar/studio class, students will develop personal collecting practices and learn how to integrate their collecting interests with their practice. Through a series of lectures and small-scale curatorial projects, we will look at artists whose practice is informed by collecting in some capacity, and how collecting and appropriating photographs may influence one' s artistic practice, whether lens-based or otherwise. We will investigate artists such as Melissa Catanese, Catherine Opie, Zoe Leonard, and Christian Boltanski, and how collecting in one form or another influences their work. We will have class discussions, an overarching collecting/sequencing assignment with integrated critiques, and share personal understandings and conceptual knowledge. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE (IM)POSSIBILITY OF ABSTRACTION IN PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Many conceptions of photography limit it to an ability to depict the world. They reference photography's capacity in rendering the world so that the subject of the picture is recognizable. This, however, is merely one small aspect of the vast potential of a photographic means of creating imagery. This course seeks to illuminate these alternative means, primarily those associated with abstraction. Students will be given assignments in the form of reading, writing, photographic production, and presentations that will all challenge the student to new conceptions of the origins, essence, meaning, and fundamental theoretical aspects of photography as a medium as it relates to abstraction. A broad range of practitioners working in relation to photography and abstraction will be explored through lectures, presentations, discussions, artist visits, and critiques. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE INTIMATE PORTRAIT: THROUGH AN OUTSIDERS LENS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What constitutes a portrait? How do we photograph someone we know intimately? How do we make an intimate portrait of someone we do not know? Does the perspective of a gender, sexual, or racial minority affect the intimacy of a portrait (or our perceptions as viewers of that intimacy?)? These are questions we will explore together by studying several portrait photographers and exploring their visions of intimacy, what it means to express those visions as a gender, sexual, or racial minority photographer, and how we can apply these ideas to our own work. During the course students will be asked to examine portraiture and the relationship between the photographer and the subject. We will look at other successful photographers of the intimate portrait, historical and contemporary, such as Julia Margaret Cameron, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Mary Ellen Mark, John Edmonds, Jen Davis, Latoya Ruby Frazier, Sally Mann, Deanna Lawson, Pixy Liao, and Zanele Muholi. Students will be introduced to the camera and its functions (aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.), basic use of lighting, learn how to scan negatives, how to use the inkjet printers, and basic editing workflow in Photoshop. The course projects will run parallel to immersive readings and discussions from the seminal text Photography's Other Histories, edited by Christopher Pinney and Nicolas Peterson, as a means to more fully contextualize the history of minority artists in portrait photography. There will be an in-class portrait session in which we can work collaboratively and discuss what does and does not work when photographing a subject. We will discuss practices for making a portrait sitting comfortable to a subject, and how the making of the portrait begins before the camera is brought out. All of these considerations will figure into the students' creation of a final body of work from a project they propose. Critical discussion of their peers' work will be an important aspect of class, and students will be expected to participate and provide feedback. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/br&lt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMINISM &amp; EXPERIMENTAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How have female-identifying artists used non-traditional forms of image-making as a means of resisiting the dominant idea of the photograph as an observation of the world? In a recent issue of Aperture Magazine, Eva Respini writes that many female-identifying artists today use experiemental photographic processes to "look inward - towards the studio, still life, re-photography, material experimentation [and] non-representation." This course will begin with an introduction to feminist theory and visual culture in order to set up our in-depth investigation of those female-identifying artists who combine experimental methods with photography, using appropriation, collage, books/zines, hand work, and abstraction. These artists will serve as a reference and guide as students explore non-traditional processes in their own studio practice. Class time will be divided between close readings of artists' work, lectures, small group discussions, hands-on demonstrations and critique, in addition to visiting artist lectures and occasional field trips. Course work will culminate with each student choosing a particular process or processes to weave into a final, cohesive body of work that participates in the discourse on feminism and visual culture. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 Deposit: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Ceramics and printmaking have a shared ethos in the production of multiples and process-driven technical methods. This is reflected in industry but is not often explored in an academic context. This course would be the first at RISD to explore the rich resources of the Ceramics and Printmaking Departments to promote research into innovative ways to combine the disciplines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For almost three centuries ceramics have been enhanced by printed elements. The combination of ceramic and print technologies have tremendous potential for new applications in functional and sculptural approaches to ceramic multiples and printed editions. RISD has all the facilities in ceramics and printmaking required to pursue research in this field. Students will learn ceramic techniques such as hand-building, throwing, slip casting and the RAM press to create forms to hold screenprinted, intaglio, relief, lithographic and digital images. Historical techniques will be presented and new methods and combinations will be developed. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all students; junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as CER-3208; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The class will cover printing with a one arm squeegee designed for printing large stencils and on a 10-foot fabric/paper printing table made to print along lengths of paper or fabric, joining each impression to the previous one to create continuous surfaces.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Methods for producing handmade stencils to making the matrix from fine dot digitally made positives will be demonstrated and taught. Screen printing on substrates from fabrics, rolled paper, rag sheets and other surfaces will be explored.  Images can involve repeated pattern, be large scale image oriented, or tiled depending on each student's individual content issues and image needs. In the second half of the semester the students will embark on a research project aimed at; producing a large-scale print or series of large scale prints, printed fabric yardage, rolled wallpaper, installation. A proposal due at mid semester will serve as a starting point for the project it should speak to; focus and direction, content and form, the techniques and strategies planned, how will the stencils be made; handmade photo, computer generated half tones or line, what materials, tools will you use what will you print on. What artist influence the work? What do you look to and at for inspiration? &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINT CULTURE: LEARNING PRINT HISTORY THROUGH OBJECT-BASED STUDY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>For centuries prints have been made, dispersed, and collected, spreading images and ideas across the globe. What can close study of prints and printed objects tell us about the cultures that made them, the historical viewers who engaged with them, the collectors who assembled them, and the historians, curators and librarians who continue to study them? How can these historical printed objects speak to the present and provide inspiration for contemporary makers? Lucky for us, Providence is a repository for prints from many cultures and time periods. Using the holdings at RISD, Brown, the Providence Public Library, the Providence Athenaeum, the Rhode Island Historical Society, and other public and private collections, this course will provide an in-depth study of prints and print culture. In the process, we will engage with topics and themes such as the inventions of movable type and the printing press, multiplicity, the circulation of images, collecting, the relationship of text and image, and the impact of digital culture. Students will learn a range of research methods relating to working with prints and will develop an independent collection-based research project. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AT THE CROSSROAD BETWEEN SCIENCE AND ART FOR SCULPTURE AND DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. To know how to criticize is good, to know how to create is better."  (Henry Poincar, 1908) &lt;br&gt; This studio course poses the following questions: What is the position of science for artists? What is the union between the artistic and the scientific world? Further, what does science look like? Why do we make art? This class uses methods of drawing and sculpture to dive into the meaning of these questions specifically as visual artists. Through combining quick drawing exercises and sculpture sketches with two formal individual and group projects, we propose a discursive investigation of the intersection between art and science. &lt;br&gt; For the first half, we will focus on exploring the development of scientific philosophy. Studio components will entail quick daily sketches and meticulous weekly analytical drawings to elucidate such ideas. While quick sketches from the first half of this course will be essentially illustrative, we will move into oral fables, short stories, and scientific hypotheses for the second half with individual and group projects. Interdepartmental collaborative efforts will be honored, and students will work closely with instructors through individual meetings. A group session will be held at the RISD Museum and Nature Lab to embrace perspectives among artists and science in a museum setting. Ultimately, advancing artists both in creative production and critical thinking is key. Students will walk away with a more well-rounded understanding of the nature of art and science as well as an investigative inward lens toward their own artistic practice. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Also offered as SCULP-1528; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO SILKSCREEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Silkscreen transcends the usual expectations of what a print can be. The size and print surface are limited only to the artist's own ambition. This printing method can be used for both fine art and utilitarian purposes. Ultimately, silkscreen can be as functional or dysfunctional as the user desires. This course will explore how printmaking can successfully achieve both of these outcomes.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As an introduction to silkscreen, this course will incorporate both hand-drawn and digital methods of stencil creation. The purpose of this course is to provide students with new skills they can use in their existing studio work. The projects will have technical themes that relate to class demonstrations however, they will be entirely open concept.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO INTAGLIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to traditional intaglio printmaking techniques while simultaneously challenging the conventional idea of a print.    Intaglio printmaking has existed since the fifteenth century and held many different functions as an art form. Throughout history intaglio printmaking has been used for recording engraved designs in metal craft, illustrating texts, as a compliment to painterly and sculptural practices, and (of course) as an art form in and of itself. Now, over 500 years after the first intaglio print was pulled, we are asking: Where can intaglio go next?    Initial coursework and visits to the RISD Museum Print will ensure that students both the technical aspects of the printmaking process and the history and tradition of editioned prints. After the technical foundation is established, students will be encouraged to bring their knowledge of other mediums into play with the intaglio process. We will explore the potential for print to expand in all dimensions---from 2D into 3D, from image into concept, from etching into a totally different process---and push the medium into new realms of collaboration and experimentation.   &lt;br&gt; This is an introductory level course. No prerequisite is required and all levels are welcome. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $175.00 &lt;/BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LETTERPRESS PRINTING ON THE VANDERCOOK PROOF PRESS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There has been a renewed interest in letterpress printing as an art form and craft. What was for centuries the main method for printing text and distributing information, had been replaced in favor of newer technologies. Today, the process has once again gained popularity for its unique tactility, ability to print imagery through polymer plates using digital illustration, and its potential for self-publishing. This course will serve as an introduction to letterpress printing. Techniques to be covered will include handset typesetting, printing and routine troubleshooting on the Vandercook press, photo polymer plate-making, multicolor printing, and registration. Photoshop basics will also be covered, as well as digital illustration techniques, how to prepare files for letterpress printing, and documentation of work.    &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTERLY PRINTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class will introduce students to a more painterly approach to printmaking. Ideally, the medium will play a role in every aspect of all images created. Monotype is the printmaking technique most closely associated with painting. Printmaking inks are painted or rolled onto a flat plate and then transferred onto the paper using a printing press. We will investigate why artists choose this medium with the goal for each participant to create their personal style within the medium. Integrating imagery from other classes to develop cross-discipline dialogue will be encouraged.    In the first part of the semester, students will be creating an experimental portfolio focusing on mastering the techniques demonstrated in class. After midterm, they will pick their favorite technique/medium and concentrate on creating a more cohesive body of work. Growth of imagery and technique will be encouraged through the medium. There will be reviews throughout the semester including a midterm and a final group critique.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAPERMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Papermaking takes over five stages and runs between wet and dry environments. This course will introduce the traditional western papermaking methods and contemporary artistic usage of handmade paper. The first week focuses on the basic sheet formation, including fiber preparing, cooking, making, pressing and drying. The second week introduces contemporary methods of working with pulp and building three-dimensional constructions. The rest of the weeks will be open to the individuals to interpret papermaking in one's language. By the end of the class, you will truly appreciate this beautiful material and combine papermaking with your media. This course is designed for people at all levels in papermaking.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>No Relief from Propaganda.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Every image with an agenda is a form of propaganda. It is just whether you try to hide that fact or whether you are honest about it. -Shepard Fairey &lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; How does visual propaganda shape culture and influence the way we view the world? What forms can propaganda assume in an effort to influence thought and opinion? The aim of this course is to introduce students to relief printing techniques that can be used as vehicles of propaganda, exploring the influence of mechanical and digital production (and reproduction) on ubiquitous, mass produced images that challenge our notion of the authentic or the original. Using relief printing techniques, print media and an exploration of theory on the subject, this course will encourage students to confront the influence of propaganda in contemporary culture.   &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERFORMANCE: OBJECT, BODY, NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores questions and methods central to performance, and in particular the relationship between performance and sculpture. Temporal and spatial dimensions of both sculpture and performance will be discussed in terms of the performance "prop" as sculpture, sculptural outcomes of performance, and sculptural documentation of performance. We will examine performance in its social, political, formal, and corporeal aspects, engaging questions of ritual, labor, and movement. Approaching sculpture in both the conventional and the "expanded" senses of the term, we will pose the question of "immaterial" sculptural forms and actions. We will consider immaterial "sculpture" as performance while also considering traditional sculpture's material concerns as performative. Sculptural material concerns of process and technique; site and context; and objects and objecthood will all be examined as performance prompts. Art historical and political questions of power, agency, audience, gaze, attention, and passivity will take shape as we theorize and enact performativity and its relation to embodiment, display, and language. Through individual and collaborative work, students will create and critique performances. A range of text, sound, lens, and object-based documentation will be encouraged. Documentation will be considered both as representational and as generative.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is the meaning of contemporary? What is the meaning of critique? What are models for sustainable and ethical artistic practice? What is the role of the artist in contemporary culture? These are but a few of the frameworks we will use to explore an array of new tools for thinking, feeling, perceiving, and analyzing the textures of our inter-subjective environment. Together, we will address the challenges implicit in the willful consideration of what exists beyond what we think we know; beyond what we have been told is true about our chosen field as artists. We take up this exploration through a selection of readings, films, lectures and class discussions. Some of the discourses we engage include the relationship between politics and aesthetics, critical race theory, myriad feminist theories, theories of institutional critique, and methods of radical practice in contemporary art.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Sculpture majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is an introduction to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar connects sophomore Sculpture majors to significant parts of the ever-expanding discipline of contemporary sculpture. Over the semester the class will explore how methods of artistic production, materials of artistic transformation, and practices of makers participating in various artistic movements have created and sustained the conversations so integral to contemporary sculptural practice. Through a series of film screenings, assigned readings, slide talks, and discussions, students will gain a familiarity with the historic events and trajectories that continue to produce associative canons and relational movements, forming the foundation of their chosen discipline. The course trajectory is coordinated with topics covered in Sculptural Practices I and II and Sophomore Sculpture: Studio I. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only.  &lt;br&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In Junior Research Studio students will be guided through a series of experiences and encounters in the community, at large that help them understand the local manifestations of larger systems. Along the way, we will ask questions and learn inquiry methods that enable an understanding of how these encounters, the conversations they spawn, and assigned readings we take on help anchor, shape, and guide the aesthetic, material, and media choices we make in our artwork. A continuation of the use of research methods in the context of a studio setting is exercised individually and in groups. Reflection is used as a tool for development. Students are challenged to explore relationships between chosen materials, subject matter, processes, and display in order to establish research practices that help them make the work they want to make.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OPERATIONAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is Operational Drawing? This workshop will make inroads into answering the question by making works that address how we image the body in time and space with tools and media. Akin to dance, drawing just might be the next human activity that engages a spontaneous simultaneous interplay of thought, action and acting upon. In this studio we will be working together and individually to explore how drawing is might to your studio practice. Drawing as a practice has often been mistakenly viewed as a preparatory or even secondary element within traditional studio practices like painting, sculpture and printmaking. Today, in an expanded field, those outmoded viewpoints only stand to unfairly discriminate and rank modes of realizing concept and form. It is also true that this archaic view of drawing has origins in the humble materials often associated within the practice, such as charcoal, graphite, chalk, and carbon black (ink). These geological elements on top of skin like substrates were once the defining features of the activity, but in a contemporary studio practice it is the artist's prerogative to either work with or challenge historical presets. The role of drawing in a contemporary studio practice may play multiple roles. Together we will look at, practice and explore that very thing through installations, group projects and large scale immersive work.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to build upon the fundamental principles of mold making and casting while exploring more complex concepts,  materials, and techniques. The transformative process of casting can embody the signs of growth or decay, of evolution and metamorphosis.  From cellular multiplicity to large scale sculptures, casting skills enable the artist to control the sensation of the finished work through a spectrum of materials and processes. &lt;BR&gt; Through demonstrations then hands-on exploration, students will pursue individual projects that reflect upon themes in sculpture that utilize casting for its unique versatility. Students will have extensive exposure to a variety of traditional and nontraditional materials. Processes will include multi-part shell molds, gypsum and composite materials for shell construction, urethane and silicone rubber, castable plastics, cold cast metals, and material specific release agents. We will review the possible health hazards associated with casting, and learn safe working methods, as well as have in-class discussions about concept and craft, various fabrication and finishing methods, and uses for molds in the making sculpture.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In Junior Research Studio students will be guided through a series of experiences and encounters in the community, at large that help them understand the local manifestations of larger systems. Along the way, we will ask questions and learn inquiry methods that enable an understanding of how these encounters, the conversations they spawn, and assigned readings we take on help anchor, shape, and guide the aesthetic, material, and media choices we make in our artwork. A continuation of the use of research methods in the context of a studio setting is exercised individually and in groups. Reflection is used as a tool for development. Students are challenged to explore relationships between chosen materials, subject matter, processes, and display in order to establish research practices that help them make the work they want to make.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is structured according the notion that artists can use what is on hand to research and craft simple solutions to the complex physical, mechanical, and technical problems that must be routinely addressed in their making practices. This material and process based, hands-on, research studio will be structured in response to the issues that the advanced fine arts student is grappling with on a regular basis. Many of the issues that arise in the process of making provide the opportunity to transcend perceived material-based boundaries and thinking. Some of the questions this course attends to include: How do you defy gravity? How do you generate the hidden components required to physicalize the thing we can see in our mind's eye? How is the magic we need to create our work scalable to the resources we have readily available? Example working processes include: mig welding, tig welding, casting for prototyping, woodworking, and mold making. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to fine arts majors only; juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED CRITICAL ISSUES SEMINAR II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Critical Issues Seminar 2 introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for thinking and writing about contemporary sculpture practice. Each seminar develops from a specific theme drawing on research from Grad Critical Issues 1, current debates in the field and contemporary events. Past seminars include: Artificial Natures, Precarious Relations, Frankenstein and Crime, Vanishing Points, as examples. Trespassing across sculpture, performance, cinema, fiction, feminist, queer, race and political theory and back again, we will address writings by Walter Benjamin, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Jacques Rancire (as examples) in conversation with contemporary artists writings and projects to cultivate a conceptual grammar to extend to our studio practice. Approaching issues in contemporary sculpture through these discursive perspectives generates new strategies simultaneously material, conceptual, and critical. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Sculpture majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuiation of Sculptural Practices I. Students are introduced to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The prevalence and rapid evolution of digital fabrication technology is due in large part to open source communities of users who actively develop and contribute to new software, hardware, and publishing platforms. In this hands-on studio we will explore both the history and potential of the open source movement as it relates to art, design, and its production. Specifically, we will build upon, modify, hack, and create new open source tools, workflows, and platforms that aid in the production of original artworks. The semester will begin with a series of projects in which students gain familiarity with the norms and practices of open source collaboration, development, and publishing. From there, students will have the opportunity to devise and use an example of open hardware in the creation of an original body of work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Topics include: bootstrapping, hacking, intellectual property, licensure and attribution, speculative fiction, Cyberpunk aesthetics, Afrofuturism, Shanzhai, additive and subtractive fabrication, physical computing, motion control systems, experimental materials, digital distribution, and dissemination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SPATIAL VIDEO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our eyes are nearly always drawn towards something moving over something inert. What innovative strategies can be employed to incorporate video, sculpture, and physical space into a single work, without one medium dominating the other? How can an artist resolve the fundamental differences between two-dimensional moving images and three-dimensional objects or space? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of assimilating video, photography, sound, performance, objects, and space through studying and constructing multimedia sculpture and installations. Throughout the semester we will be presented with assignments that examine these different possibilities from multiple perspectives, including studio projects that deploy video in a sculptural context, and sculpture that is only activated through a video work. We will study the recent history of artists and designers who engage multimedia techniques and experiment with new formats and technologies. Students will learn the basics of DSLR camera technique, digital video editing, audio production, audio/video display technology, and installation techniques. Students in the course should have an understanding of sculptural materials and fabrication techniques, and should be ready to experiment with the fundamental structure of the presentation of media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Junior Seminar: Critical Issues is an intermediary level course designed to facilitate and support an intense study of themes relevant to art practices and conversations today. Through a series of readings, films, classroom discussion, group, and independent work, students learn to contextualize myriad discourses using the frames of art history, critical theory, philosophy, ethics, and politics. In this studio-centered seminar, students will develop a critical literacy that is applicable to their working practices and the attendant process of using materials to make meaning. This course supports discourse around the formation of the artist in an effort to figure out meaningful strategies for the development and maintenance of sustainable artistic and intellectual practices. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WANDERING RUINS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The ruins of the Church and of the aristocracy, of feudalism, of the Middle Ages, are sublime-- they fill the wide-eyed victors of today with admiration. But the ruins of the bourgeoisie will be an ignoble detritus of cardboard, plaster, and coloring."  -- W. Benjamin, Arcades Project, C2a, 8. &lt;H.Balzac. Le diable  Paris, vol.2, p.18.&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Wandering Ruins is a course which will examine the many meanings of ruin in the contemporary context. This is a research studio class with an emphasis on materiality, storytelling and challenging structures of time. Students will be asked to consider the materials of their daily surroundings in relation to their commercial and cultural entanglements. Projects in this course will focus on imagined possible worlds and how ruins can play a part in the material development and speculation of these worlds. The final installation project will be a collective exhibition. Through demos, presentations, critiques readings, films soires and cooking exercises, we will expand the idea of ruins and the ways of thinking about their materiality. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will focus on performance art as a way to consider the digital body through new media, the internet, and social media apps. We will be looking closely into internet content as a means of dispersion, accessibility, and thinking about the history of circulation of digital images.  The class will create and name an Instagram account where students will post daily performances with smartphones, Gopros and other methods of recording, with mainly 'low-brow' tech as their tools. The class will discuss the relationship between performer and audience through the shifting positions of roles and perspectives. We will be looking at artists such as Lil Miquela, Shaye St. John, Marina Abramovic, and Bas Jan Ader with accompanied readings, and videos. Additionally, there will be Skype talks with artists who are dealing with the internet and performance in their practice. Students will have the opportunity to work both individually and collaboratively with weekly and semester performance objectives and goals. The goal of the weekly assignments throughout the course will be more aligned with developing a fully formed concept than producing fragmentary works.   &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a laboratory focused on the collision of performance and public speaking, pursuing the creative potential of the hybrid form of the lecture-performance. What happens when public speaking becomes artwork? How is research something we do with our bodies? How can we understand knowledge dissemination as an intercorporeal event? Students in this course will create their own lecture-performances, study the history of the form, gain literacy in theories of interdisciplinarity, and will work with visiting artists to present new lecture performances to the RISD community and the wider public. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3-DIMENSIONAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How do artists know which graphical tools to use when they have a need to represent sculptural objects? Throughout human history, many uniquely propositional graphic works depicting sculptural objects in space have reflected properties, methods and materials that are native to the technological advances of their era. In this era of digital ubiquity, the cutting edge manual tools at the origins of dimensional representation can be easily overlooked or forgotten.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This studio proposes a fresh look at those analog tools and methods of 3 dimensional representation by remaking, bending and hacking them. Experiencing and rethinking these manual tools and methods in parallel with learning the core basics in 3D Software, (Rhino 3D) we will build pathways toward individualized methods of dimensional drawing for sculpture. This studio will engage the Sculpture Department's Digital Fabrication Lab and provide students with the core software skills to use digital 3D output within the department and CoWorks.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Students will experience methods in observational, technical, digital and photographic tools that may be harnessed, combined, bent and hacked to aid problem solving in object creation. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will leave the class with a working knowledge of practical video techniques using Adobe Premier, After Effects, 3D mapping platforms, projectors, monitors, and expanded installation techniques. Authorship and the relationship of the artist or performer to the frame or stage will be a driving focus of the course, as will the poetics and politics of representation and popularity in story-telling and digital media. With the assumption that no images remain forever frozen in time, meaning, or identity students will be encouraged to consider portraiture and performance as fluid, and poetically, unstable acts.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction. In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques such as crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way throughout the entire process. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design and Textiles Departments, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as FD-2523 for Furniture Design majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DOBBY WEAVING AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is an investigation of the technical, formal and material potential of multi-harness weave structures on 24-harness dobby looms. Through extensive sampling on the looms, students expand their skills in areas of pattern development, woven structure, color, material and fabric finishing while further developing their design concepts and their visual and material vocabularies. During the second half of the semester, stipulations derived from the intended end use of the fabric as well as production methods become a strong part of the design considerations in the development of fabric collection for an intended application. Exercises in drafting, both by hand and on computer, as a means of understanding woven structure in a three-dimensional way, will be an imporant part of the course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Trolls, bots and memes oh my!  In the forest of online hocus-pocus, where does form and material exploration IRL exist? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of image and material appropriation through textile-based study and construction.  We will engage with rudimentary forms of  off-loom weaving, hand knitting, felting and latch hook rug techniques as they pertain to building sculptural form.  Students will be introduced to histories of artists and designers as well as explore methodologies of montage, trompe l'oeil and collage through lectures, readings and visits to the RISD Museum's Costume Collection.  We will look at such artists as Betye Saar, Shinique Smith, Stan Brakhage, Josh Faught, Mike Kelley, Marcel Duchamp, Jessica Stockholder, Hannah Hch, Wangechi Mutu and Wendy Red Star.  The class will explore pattern making, re-using and recycling materials to new ends and applying methodologies and techniques to unorthodox materials.   Students in the course do not need a background in textiles or sculpture, but should be open and ready to experiment, discuss and explore individually and as a group. The final week of the class will be the making of a work that will bring together the threads of the previous weeks' exploration, experimentation and study.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL EMBROIDERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  A series of small assignments will build up a repertoire of techniques and culminate in a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personalized images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration for Spring semester.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: COLOR, MESTIZAJE AND DESIGN FUTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will be introduced to the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca and its biodiverse environs as home to a radical mixture of cultures and ethnicities: Zapotec, Mixtec, and a host of other indigenous communities; mestizos, or those with mixed Spanish and indigenous heritage; as well as the historically under recognized Afro Mexican communities. They will be exposed to the region's internationally regarded textiles, ceramics, and cuisine, as well as to the complex practices of using plants, insects, and shellfish as dyes and colorants. With an understanding in place of the rich foundation of ancient, precolonial techniques and material culture, students will experience the vibrant postcolonial culture of contemporary artistic practice that has been fueled by political activism, self-determination, and local artistic support and patronage. They will see and respond to the ways in which centuries of social inequities brought about by Spanish colonial subordination are being addressed and repaired through the reclamation of artisanal expertise and through the social reach of activist graphic arts messaging. The studio component of the course will immerse students in Oaxaca's vibrant cultural, social and artistic history by focusing on materials and colorants that have moved from ancient use to colonial appropriation to indigenous repossession, including indigo blues, shellfish purple, and cochineal, a brilliant pink-red color extracted from cactus eating insects that was also one of the most lucrative Spanish colonial exports. Via collaborative workshops organized by Oaxfornia, students will learn from and engage with traditional techniques and applications of color while recording their personal artistic responses to these exchanges. In the latter part of the course students will interact with local instructors and visiting artist Christina Kim to process and apply lessons from their cross-cultural exchanges to create graphic arts projects developed within the context of Centro de Arte de San Agustn (CaSa), an arts center with an international residency program and a conceptual infrastructure based on local ecology and community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt;Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental &amp; Foundation Studies.  &lt;br&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $3,260.00 - airfare not  included.  &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MATERIALITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Initial approaches to digital design more often than not embraced and exacerbated a modernist presumption that the definition of geometric form is separate from the assignment of material. Consider, for example, the manner in which materiality is reduced to the application of a texture in ray-traced rendering. More recent developments in design and fabrication technologies, however, suggest an altogether different vision for digital materiality. In this counter-narrative - which we see reflected in the recent enthusiasm for the parallel development of advanced manufacturing techniques and invention of smart materials - rather than signifying the final dissolution of form and material, technological innovation might herald their eventual synthesis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For textiles, even in the age of computer-controlled tools, the hand and tacit material knowledge have remained instrumental participants in the integration of pattern and structure into fabric. As technological innovations now allow for added dimensionality and functionality in fabric, drawing and intuiting in the same manner has become more difficult, and computation is now regarded as a key additional interface for material exploration. This course will introduce computational concepts geared towards equipping students to leverage the contemporary material culture of textile design. Topics that may arise during this course include modeling versus simulation, digital technologies for novel additive/subtractive approaches, re-engaging drawing using code, using digital design to reduce material waste, and creative surface interfaces. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: Varies by project.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;Also offered as IDISC-2350; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How do we interpret art and visual culture? How does the meaning of an individual work of visual art change over historical time? This course will examine a variety of answers to these questions. The class will be run as a colloquium of individual episodes in the interpretation of art from antiquity to the present day. We will look at visual culture through the lenses of: style, form, Iconography, Marxism, Feminism, Queer Theory, Prehistory, Psychoanalysis, Deconstruction, artist's biography, reproductions and facsimiles of art, conservation of objects, Orientalism, museum studies, contemporary art magazines, and more.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The course material consists of lectures and readings. Students will be graded on the following criteria: attendance, in-class writing assignments, and group discussions. Preparation of readings is essential.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This course is recommended for THAD concentrators and fulfills the "Historiography/ Methodology" concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt;All interested undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>French Surrealism played an important role in the development of 20th-century European and American art.  The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BODY IN (AS) ART: OBJECT, SUBJECT, MEDIUM, LENS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the body as subject, object, medium, and lens. This class is intended as both a discussion of the shifting role of the human form as represented and implicated in artwork from nineteenth century to the present day, as well as an experiential interrogation of our own somatic experience as scholars, artists, and humans, in order to ask the question: what does the body have to teach us? We will address the discourses of the imaged and imagined body prior to and through European modernism as a carrier of meaning and an object to be consumed, with particular attention to the ramifications of the Cartesian mind-body distinction. From this starting point, we will track shifts and the development of alternate theories of the body from psychology, philosophy, critical theory, and neuroscience, from the nineteenth century into present day. In addition to theory and philosophy, we will address how these shifts are manifest in artwork of the twentieth century from painting, sculpture installation art, video, and augmented reality art. Students will be asked to be mindful of their own somatic (bodily) practices, including movement inside and outside class with the intention of developing a deeper understanding the body as lens for experience and production.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the myth and cultural importance placed on spaces and objects occupied and used by the so-called "geniuses" of American history alongside our general romantic interest in "the genius" as a cultural phenomenon. We will examine the designed objects and spaces of famous American artists and heroes - places such as Graceland, Dollywood, and Marfa; objects like Thomas Jefferson's writing desk; and museums created out of the homes of Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain, among others. In an attempt to unpack and understand the importance of objects in both memory- and identity-making, we will consider how visual and material objects both communicate personality and legacy and how they act as mediators between each "genius" and their audiences, allowing visitors to come into contact with the imaginative worlds of their heroes.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: PRE-COLUMBIAN ARCHITECTURE AND TRADITIONAL CRAFTS IN MEXICO, AN OVERVIEW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a travel course offered by the Liberal Arts Division with a cross-disciplinary collaboration between HPSS and THAD; the HPSS component addresses the pre-Columbian history of the architecture and the arts in several regions of Mexico, including Mexico City, where we will visit the Diego Rivera, Siquieros and Orozco murals, Frida Kahlo's house &amp; museum, Bellas Artes museum, the world reknown anthropology museum, and Xochimilco, the canals left from the early settlement of the Valley of Mexico by the Mixteca/Aztec civilization), Puebla (known for its ceramics production and its ties to early colonial commerce), nearby Cholula with its many colonial churches, Veracruz (culturally relevant as a port city where African slaves were bought to, as well as for its ties to other Caribbean regions), and Merida, the most culturally active city in the Yucatan peninsula, giving access to several early and Classic Maya archaeological sites. &lt;br&gt; This portion of the course will also address the contemporary cultural traditions that distinguish each region from each other in terms of crafts production, the use of local materials, and the identifying regional dress, language and cuisine modalities. &lt;br&gt; Prior to leaving for Mexico, the students will be given a illustrated lecture with an overview of Mexico's past cultural and political history, including the development of major civilizations throughout Mexico, the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th c., the Mexican revolution, and the current political structure of the country. During our travel, each site visit will be accompanied by a brief contextual introduction orienting the students to the site's contributions to Mexico's history and cultural context.  &lt;br&gt; The course hopes to not only inform students about the culture and history of our neighbors to the South, but also give them knowledge and an appreciation for the many contributions that Mexican past civilizations and contemporary Mexican culture have provided globally, and continue to bring to us. We also hope that our traveling students will learn about group dynamics, develop sensitivity towards a culture that might be foreign to them, be willing to explore a host of new traditions, acquire new knowledge, and discard possible stereotypes and preconceptions about an American region to which so many of our US citizens and immigrants have a connection to. &lt;br&gt; The requirements for the HPSS portion of the course includes a series of pre-departure readings (see syllabus) and the keeping of a journal that includes both written descriptions and observations as well as sketches of the many site visits;  this requirement is part of exploring the focused discipline of "visual ethnography", i.e. the observation and visual description of environs, people and material culture through simple available tools: paper and pencil (or other portable tools such as water colors, etc.). &lt;br&gt; Students' grades will take into account their participation and inquisitiveness in/about the various site visits, a written quiz on the readings, and the interest the Yoruba show through their journals and sketches. We hope to have their work exhibited at our journey's end on the RISD campus. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for THAD-W135 and HPSS-W235. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental &amp; Foundation Studies.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $3,200.00 - airfare  included. &lt;br&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Embodiment is a universal. How we construct our understandings of it is not. In this class we will investigate conceptions and depictions of the early-modern body (1400-1700) mainly in Europe with excursions to Africa, Brazil, China, Japan. Among our topics will be: understanding correspondences and the macrocosm, the classical body and its aesthetics of beauty; the grotesque; naked or nude?; criminal and saintly bodies, including the divine/mortal body of Christ; death, ritual and the macabre; physiognomy and the face; the science of sexuality and art of erotics; constructing genders; medicine, knowledge, and the culture of dissection; fragmentation and the resonance of body parts. We'll analyze historical materials with an eye for current practices in bodily identities, such as gender fluidity, body enhancement and performance, body as machine. And, we'll make frequent use of RISD's art collection.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduates sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This social history of Renaissance art in Florence includes the study of drawing, painting, sculpture, and architecture from about 1250 to 1500. Our approach will be at once chronological and thematic, examining the visual culture of political power structures. Beginning with the concept of Renaissance as rebirth, the private and public spaces of the city of Florence shall be traced and investigated. In a period of massive transition in the arts, Italo-Byzantine mosaics and the Pisan sculptural tradition will give way to the panorama of public sculpture and performance art in a guild-driven republic. Painting techniques and the practice of disegno will be presented in terms of artistic training and apprenticeship. The expansion of the Medici family's influence and power can be witnessed according to Cosimo's building campaigns and art in the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent.  Mythological and religious subjects will be studied in context according to patronage and intellectual trends.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to undergraduates sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EPISTEMOLOGIES OF (SELF)CARE: THEORIES AND PRACTICES OF CARING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a combination of theoretical inquiry into care and self-care as creative and intellectual methodology and a practical laboratory in which students can reflect on and cultivate the practices that support their work and integrity of well-being.  Audre Lorde's famous words - caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare - carry fraught meaning in a moment wherein callousness and a lack of empathy seem to dictate political and social discourse. The theoretical aim of this class is to unpack the notion of caring, often constructed as an individual concern and practice which makes it vulnerable to neoliberal co-option, and its expression on a spectrum from Lorde's radical self-preservation to the empathetic relationship building necessary to maintain (often marginalized) communities. The practical aspects of this course encourage students to consider the different infrastructures that work to encourage self-care and mutual care, and to locate tools that support their artistic and scholarly practices. We will examine the notions of surviving, coping, and thriving, pointing not only to case studies in the literature, but examining how these themes appear in our personal experience. This class has an Academic Enrichment budget to enable an experiential module and as such, no more than 20 students can be accommodated. The waitlist will be strictly followed.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO IRANIAN CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"From international film festivals to university campuses, from museums of modern art to neighborhood theaters, Iranian cinema has now emerged as the staple of a cultural currency that defies the logic of nativism and challenges the problems of globalization." Hamid Dabashi writes this in the introduction to his landmark study of Iranian cinema, Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present and Future (Verso, 2001). This course introduces you to the history of Iranian cinema, from the Iranian New Wave (1960s) to the present. It examines the ways in it occupies an important place on the scene of global cinema while it "defies the logic of nativism." We will watch some of the most prominent movies by acclaimed Iranian filmmakers Dariush Mehrjui, Ebrahim Golestan, Nasser Taghvai, Amir Naderi, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Forough Farrokhzad, Jafar Panahi, Masoud Kimiai, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Bahram Beyzaie, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, Marzieh Meshkini, Asghar Farhadi, Tahmineh Milani, Ebrahim Hatamikia, and Kamran Shirdel. We will also look at the works of diasporic artists, including Shirin Neshat, Marjane Satrapi, Ramin Bahrani, Mitra Farahani, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Granaz Moussavi. &lt;br&gt; There is a separate evening film screening from 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM each Thursday.

We will investigate the practices through which things-from food and clothing to smart phones-become meaningful, as we tackle political and ethical questions related to the design, manufacture, use and disposal of material goods. The class will introduce students to a range of scholarship on material culture from several disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, history, sociology, art and architectural history, and cultural studies. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates.

   <COURSETITLE>THAD I: GLOBAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a required course for all freshmen and transfer students to introduce them to global modern and contemporary art, architecture and design in the period between 1750 and the present. The course addresses modernism as a global project, presenting several case studies from across the world that unfold to show how multiple kinds of modernism developed in different times and distant places. By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates.

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: PRE-COLONIAL TO CONTEMPORARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This travel course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between HPSS and THAD; the THAD component addresses colonial, modern, and contemporary arts in several regions of Mexico, including Mexico City, where we will view murals by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo's house and museum, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and the world-renowned Museo de Antropologa; Puebla, known for its ceramics production and its ties to early colonial commerce, as well as nearby Cholula with its many colonial churches; Veracruz, a port city distinctive for its ties to the Caribbean and as a site of the importation of enslaved Africans; and Mrida, the most culturally active city in the Yucatn Peninsula, with access to several early and classic Maya archaeological sites, as well as a vibrant contemporary arts scene.  &lt;br&gt; The THAD portion of the course will cover the colonial, modern, and contemporary periods in terms of artistic, architectural, and visual production, considering how indigenous pre-colonial techniques and traditions (addressed in the HPSS portion of the course) are revived, reinvented, and synthesized with European, African, and Asian styles, materials, and practices.  &lt;br&gt; Prior to leaving for Mexico, the students will be given a illustrated lecture with an overview of Mexico's past cultural and political history, including the development of major civilizations throughout Mexico, the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th c., the Mexican revolution, and the current political structure of the country. During our travel, each site visit will be accompanied by a brief contextual introduction orienting the students to the site's contributions to Mexico's history and cultural context.  &lt;bR&gt; The course hopes to not only inform students about the culture and history of our neighbors to the South, but also give them knowledge and an appreciation for the many contributions that Mexican past civilizations and contemporary Mexican culture have provided globally, and continue to bring to us. We also hope that our traveling students will learn about group dynamics, develop sensitivity towards a culture that might be foreign to them, be willing to explore a host of new traditions, acquire new knowledge, and discard possible stereotypes and preconceptions about an American region to which so many of our US citizens and immigrants have a connection to.  &lt;br&gt; For the THAD portion of the course, students will be required to write two short papers (3 pages, double-spaced) that reflect upon the readings and/or the sites visited. They should be focused, organized responses that include a clear thesis (or guiding idea) rather than being a stream-of-conscious response, but may incorporate personal reflections, impressions, and opinions. The course will conclude with a focused, researched response (5-7 pages) that engages with some aspect of Mexican art, architecture, or visual culture, from the pre-colonial period to the present day. It may incorporate personal reflections and impressions, but it should reference and cite specific texts that we have read in the course, as well as artworks and/or sites we have visited during our trip. Papers will be due after our return from Mexico.  &lt;br&gt; Students' grades will take into account their participation and inquisitiveness in/about the various site visits, as well as their level of inquiry and critical engagement demonstrated in their written responses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for THAD-W135 and HPSS-W235. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course.

   <COURSETITLE>THAD I: GLOBAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a required course for all freshmen and transfer students to introduce them to global modern and contemporary art, architecture and design in the period between 1750 and the present. The course addresses modernism as a global project, presenting several case studies from across the world that unfold to show how multiple kinds of modernism developed in different times and distant places. By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates. There are no waivers for THAD-H101. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Attention transfers and upperclass students: Please register into one of the evening sections set aside for transfer and upperclass students if you have not completed this first-year graduation requirement. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator in the Liberal Arts Division office for assistance if needed. All other H101 sections are for freshmen. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEA, COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE? THE VISUAL AND MATERIAL CULTURE OF EXOTIC DRINKS IN PRE-INDUSTRIAL EUROPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We are so familiar with these three hot drinks but they became commodities and part of our everyday only recently. This course explores what values were attached to these plants before the era of industrialized production, i.e. before ca. 1800. We will survey how Westerners adopted these beverages by looking at medical theories, the issue of morality, and the expansion of sugar production. We will also study how the craving for these products reinforced or even spurred slavery in French, Dutch, and English colonies. Special attention is dedicated to how ritual behavior affects design in terms of the sociability around these beverages, required manners, and the tableware crafted for them. The methodology is based on the analysis of images, discussions of assigned readings, written responses, visits to museums (RISD and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), and touring the facility of a chocolate artisan. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Premodern Worlds: Theory &amp; History of Art &amp; Design 102 builds on H101 by providing an introduction to global art, design, and visual culture before the Industrial Revolution. The course emphasizes themes of contact, conquest, collaboration, and crossroads as they played out across the fluid borders that preceded the modern nation-state. By following the movement of people and goods, art and ideas, materials and processes through the centuries, the course provides a historical context for the development of modernism.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Required for graduation for all undergraduates. Course is scheduled to be taken by first-year students during the Spring semester of freshmen year. The Liberal Arts office will place freshmen into sections of H102 after spring studio schedules are completed by the EFS office. There are no waivers for students entering as freshmen. However, students who completed H101 prior to fall 2018 may opt to waive out of H102. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator for assistance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Transfer students may petition the THAD department head to substitute an equivalent college course that was completed prior to enrollment at RISD. Seats for transfers and upperclass students are available but limited. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator in the Liberal Arts Division office for help with registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND TRAUMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the discourse art and trauma. It beings with a history of trauma studies, with its roots in Holocaust studies, Freudian interpretation, and the discipline of Psychology. It ventures on to explore the ramifications of understanding trauma in the realm of imag(in)ing suffering, whether represented through journalism, popular media, or artistic representation. We will interrogate how the models posited by trauma theory hold up in the age of new media. A recurrent motif in the class will be what it means to study trauma and its representation, both abstractly and personally, ethically and psychosomatically, and establish practices for maintaining sustainable and responsible modes of inquiry.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE GLOBAL ART WORLD AND ITS MARGINS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The promise of globalization to democratize the art world and decrease the gap between canonic centers of art and their peripheries appears today to be no more than an empty pledge. As the art historian Joaquin Barriendos argues, the inclusion of non-Western regions in the Western canons of art and art history has proven incapable of destabilizing the hegemonic positions which Western institutions, as arbitrators of contemporary art, comfortably occupy. This course examines a range of critical responses to globalization in the art world from the mid-1980s to the present offered from a variety of perspectives informed by debates in Marxism, Postcolonialism, Feminism, Anti-colonialism, Nationalism, etc. The goal of this course is, first of all, to think critically about the relation between Western centers of art and art historical knowledge production and contemporary art located at the margins of Western Europe and North America through an attempt to trace the origins and development of the period known as the age of globalization. We will also explore works of art and curatorial practices that perform critiques of the limits of cross-cultural exchange in the global art world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE STUFF OF AMERICA: POSTWAR MATERIAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar examines the postwar production of modernity in the Americas vis--vis the raw and synthetic materials that provided its physical makeup. In a period of rapid, but irregular, industrialization throughout the hemisphere, many artists and architects made use of unconventional materials to visualize, interrogate, or otherwise manifest the tensions endemic to modernization. Some turned to technological innovations such as concrete and Plexiglas to signal the dawn of a new, utopian era; still others incorporated natural materials like gold, sugar, and oil to call attention to a colonialist history of resource extraction and commodification. Proceeding thematically rather than regionally or chronologically, we will consider a series of case studies that foreground the materials of American modernity-not only as they materialize in discrete works of art or architecture, but also as they proliferate across larger, more diffuse networks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the architectural traditions of the Indigenous cultures of North America, Mesoamerica, and South America in historic perspective.  Examinations will focus on the critical cultural and environmental circumstances which led to the development of distinctive architectural styles throughout the Americas.  Approached from an anthropological/archaeological perspective, specific topics of discussion will include the following: construction methods and material choices, spatial arrangements and use areas, the relationship between physical and social community structure, and architectural manifestation of cultural belief systems.  Emphasis will also be placed on manipulations of the landscape in response to social and climatic needs.  Architectural culture discussed in this course will range widely in scale, dispersal and geography - from the igloo of a small Inuit hunting party to the entire Mayan city of Chichen Itza, to the terrace and irrigation systems of the Inca.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY ART IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to the history of modern, postmodern, and contemporary art in the Global South. Over the past decade, the Global South has emerged as aubiquitous, compelling, and contested term in the humanities, social sciences, and increasingly in public culture and policy. Rather than referring to the literal geographies of the southern hemisphere, this designation more broadly, and more critically, is evoked to signal the subjects and spaces affected by various forms of globalization, usually in negative and complicated ways. The Global South has also become a key rubric for cataloging and comprehending certain arts discourses and practices, as well as their variegated histories across the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Despite its relatively recent and ongoing theorization, the Global South encourages a richer, more complex dialogue between people, places, objects, ideas, and experiences. It calls into question the myopic perspective of the nation-state that has traditionally governed the discipline of art history. Cutting across Africa, Central and Latin America, and Asia, as well as their diasporic contexts, this course will investigate modernism as a local, national, and global constellation of intellectual questions and aesthetic responses resulting from modernization, colonial conquest, capitalism, and cultural intermingling. As opposed to most art-historical narratives that are anchored to Euro-American cultural hubs such as Paris and New York, this course will unearth a profusion of origin stories about where, how, and why modern sensibilities and aesthetic trends came into view. As such, our artistic epicenters will consist of places like Istanbul, Beirut, Johannesburg, Lagos, So Paulo, Havana, New Delhi, and Beijing. Due to the multidirectional flows of artworks, capital, people, and concepts across such cosmopolitan cities, new pathways opened up for postulating and producing modern painting, sculpture, print, and photography. Subsequently, we will track how, from roughly the 1960s to the present, understandings of postmodernism and the contemporary were consonant with pioneering aesthetic experimentation and formal explosion across video, performance, installation art, new media, and beyond. In particular, we will chronicle how contemporary artists, curators, and critics in and from the Global South have engaged with lineages of modernism, calling for new interpretive categories and analytical frameworks that can effectively address present-day predicaments and preoccupations. One of our prime assumptions will be that the work of art is an essential battleground on which political, economic, and social struggles were fought. Instead of adopting a strictly geographical, chronological, or comparative approach in the course, we will focus our attention on salient themes that resonate across disparate historical contexts. Lectures will attend to the following topics in relation to the Global South (almost always in conversation with the Global North): modernization, urbanization, industrialization, and colonization; concepts of the avant-garde; anti-imperialism, decolonizing art, and the art of decolonization; renegotiated relationships between art, media, science, and technology; the role of mass culture in generating new aesthetic programs; dawning templates of interpretation and criticism; abstraction; tensions between political repression and artistic freedom and innovation; art academies, museums, galleries, and other institutions as vectors of (and impediments to) the modern; the gargantuan cultural effects of war, especially the Cold War, and other geopolitical Circumstances; the impact of nongovernmental organizations on artistic practice; world exhibitions, biennials, and traveling shows; questions of materiality, process, labor, and reproduction; the politics of identity; shifting notions of artistic subjectivity and forms of collectivity; exile, diaspora, migration, and notions of hybridity and entanglement; the position of art within social movements and as propaganda; neoliberalism; cultural imaginaries of the network; and the omnipresence of the Internet and social media. Other lectures will be devoted to tracing some of the global routes of artistic movements such as Surrealism, Cubism, Primitivism, Expressionism, Pop Art, and Conceptual Art. Throughout these endeavors, we will draw on different methodological approaches, from postcolonial studies to critical Marxism, cultural studies, feminism, and queer theory. A nuanced analysis of power and racialization will be fundamental to our understanding of how art variously operates within, as a powerful agent of, and in sharp condemnation of global capitalism.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MARKETS, MEMORIES, AND RADICAL IMAGININGS OF EVIDENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Old Market House building, completed in 1775, was the first public market house in Providence. Designed by the architect of the oldest building on Brown University's campus in collaboration with a signer of the Declaration of Independence; this market housed food vendors, masons, soldiers, and politicians who conducted business across four centuries within its walls, making it arguably the most historic home of commerce in the city. During its past, this same building (now a RISD owned property) was also the hub of a different type of commerce, and operated as a very different type of market; a slave market to be precise. In this course, students will utilize techniques from their degree programs along with digital humanities tools to create community-engaged projects/works that reckon with Market House's past, while acknowledging that its past is not separate from our present. That we indeed exist in what Christina Sharpe calls "the ongoingness of the conditions of capture." Given the myriad of possible acts of participation and/or complicity with enslavement that took place in the Market House Building, and Market Square overall, students will be exposed to scholarly research on the slave pens, slave markets, slave jails, and auction blocks that proliferated the United States, Rhode Island in particular, during both the transatlantic and intra-state slave trades. Students will study how literalist demands for evidence impact the pasts, memories, and historical narratives of slavery that do and do not make it onto the public landscape. Moreover, through different assignments during the semester students will interrogate and unpack their own relationships to evidence as a concept. This course is an invitation to undertake a series of speculative arguments within, against, and beyond multiple archives; to use radical research methodologies to accept Saidiya Hartman's task to "tell an impossible story, and amplify the impossibility of its telling" no matter the evidence, or supposed lack thereof. Please note, this is a year long course, and students are encouraged to commit to both semesters, however they may sign up for the fall or spring independently, space permitting.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to be a "deep-dive" into the liberatory archaeologies of racialized, gendered, and sexual memory(s) articulated by Xicanx, Latinx, Native American, and Africana scholars, artists, creatives, activists, and cultural workers that resist the epistemic regimes of antiblackness, colonialism, and white supremacy. Students have the opportunity to engage scholarly and artistic works that exemplify how Blackness rejects while simultaneously marking in many ways, the limits and logic of gender and sexuality, exposing the colonial underpinnings of "Man" and modern ideas of "human." This course focuses on monuments, maps, and archives as three distinct sites where antiblackness, colonialism, and white supremacy are both sanctioned and defied in the public sphere. Students will examine research from multiple scholars that troubles the assumption that becoming assimilated and included as "human" and "citizen" in the eyes of the State is progress for Black and Native communities. Using the Black Digital Humanities, students will demonstrate their comprehension and command of the thematic foundations of the course by creating their own narratives of memory and resistance via spatial visualization and/or auditory digital software.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POWER, DEPENDENCE AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN EARLY MODERN VISUAL CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the visual culture of social welfare and justice during the early modern era (1500-1900). A powerful guild of silk manufacturers sponsored the construction of the first large-scale orphanage for abandoned children in Renaissance Florence, employing architects, painters, woodworkers and sculptors. "Talking statues" in Rome advocated for the end of oppressive taxation by over-zealous popes.  Printmakers across Europe turned out satirical woodcuts and engravings that graphically argued for better living conditions and labor laws in the age of industrialization.  Josiah Wedgewood issued a plaque that poignantly pleaded for the abolishment of slavery.  Here, we study a broad range of imagery, objects and architecture that forged a language of social justice that still exists today.  Drawing on the rich collections of the RISD Museum, Fleet Library Special Collections and the John Hay Library at Brown, among others, we examine the role of patrons, artists and designers in advocating for, and advancing, social welfare in an increasingly urban and educated society.</COURSEDESC>

The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL AESTHETICS: WRITING ABOUT ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this introductory workshop on the professional practice of critical writing for artists and designers, students will compose short-form analyses of their own work, that of their classmates, and works in the RISD Museum. Topics to be considered will include the durational experience of looking at static objects (we will spend several sessions attending to single pieces for extended periods of time and recording the sequential development of our observations); the particularity of individual perspective (we will discuss the subjective, improvisational aspects of critical writing as related to our own lives); and the work in context (we will look outward from the objects at hand to the economies and networks of circulation to which they belong, and consider how these economies and networks affect the objects' meaning). Our goal-demystifying criticism-will facilitate not just the creation of reviews and such critical-adjacent texts as artist's statements and institutional communication, but also the conceptual enrichment of our art and design practices themselves. Short readings in contemporary criticism and critical theory will be accompany writing assignments each week.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLUE JEANS AND BARBIE DOLLS: DESIGNING THE AMERICAN DREAM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines 20th century American popular culture - both visual and material - in relation to American history in order to understand how it reinforces socio-political ideologies in everyday life. We will look at and learn to decode advertisements as key to the cultural meanings of objects and as propaganda in reinforcing and disseminating cultural values. Using pop culture objects/concepts such as Disney, Tupperware, Barbie dolls, cars, TV, and the "American Dream," we will explore democracy, capitalism, and questions of "high" and "low" cultural artifacts.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY ART SINCE 1960</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will trace major developments in contemporary art from the 1960s to the present. Beginning with the shift away from modernist abstraction in the late 1950s and proceeding chronologically, we will examine the diverse array of movements, practices, and events that have come to define the larger field of contemporary art: minimalism, conceptualism, and pop in the 1960s, site specific and performance art in the 1970s, the "culture wars" and postmodernist debates of the 1980s, and the various forms of "abject," project-based, and "relational" art that followed. Foregrounding problems that have remained central for artists throughout this period - the status of the body, the institutional conditions of artistic production and reception, the politics of representation and difference - we will focus on putting the shifting terrain of contemporary art into broad social, historical, and theoretical perspective. In turn, we will attempt to develop a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the aesthetic and political stakes of contemporary art today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FORMS OF NATURE: THE ENVIRONMENT IN ART AND ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course studies the diversity of ways that humans have conceived of nature and wilderness. It seeks to understand the deep historicity and variety of such conceptions by following a few theoretical threads that span over vast reaches of time and space as well as across the multiple disciplines constituting the environmental humanities.  We begin with modern debates over the significance of nature and wilderness.  Through related explorations of the landscape in postwar art, we travel back in time to study the garden as a microcosm that both resists and mediates wilderness.   We then return gradually to the present to understand how modern architects and engineers mobilized conceptions of nature for colonial and economic ends.  The course concludes by introducing debates on the Anthropocene and the "end" of nature that draw on postcolonial theory, literary criticism, and ethnography. Through readings, discussions and presentations, students will learn to critically identify and distinguish the range of human expressions of nature with appreciation for historical, cultural, and ideological differences. They will also develop their ability to make connections between texts and cultural products including visual arts, architecture, and landscape architecture.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement for MA; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN EDUCATION WORKSHOP II: PLACE - PRODUCT - SYSTEM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The place, product and systems design problems and exercises in this fall studio-based workshop build on the documentation design tools developed during the summer design course TLAD-654G Design Education Workshop I.  The sequence of courses have been developed in tandem specifically to expand the repertoire of K-12 educators' curriculum toolkits to include design. Further, this course provides educators with an invaluable foundation with which to engage in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) teaching.   This course, with an emphasis on place, product and system, introduces design principles as tools for creative problem solving and making as related to the physical world we inhabit.  In this course, students experiment with materials, work at the scale of the body, with spaces of enclosure and gathering, and with complex built and natural environmental systems.  The goal is to work as a designer, using design principles and methodologies as a way to explore the world in which we live and to experiment with materials in ways that address everyday problems. In working through the course design problems, students are introduced to design tools and materials for observation, iteration, prototyping and documenting user experience to solve design problems. Throughout the course, students adapt newly introduced design methods to curriculum proposals for design teaching and learning elementary and secondary school settings.  &lt;B&gt; The combined set of design toolkits developed through the summer and fall design education studio workshops will assist educators form the foundation for a design pedagogy to be carried forward into their K-12 art and design teaching.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for MAT &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-major graduate students by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Exploring art and design within the context of the non-profit sector is the goal of the seminar. We will examine the roles and responsibilities of non-profit arts organizations from both a practical and ideological perspective to relate them to one's own artistic or design practice or professional aspirations. The course will visit regional arts non-profits, examining their life cycles and the factors that shape an agency's success and/or failure. Organizations investigated may include: arts councils, service organizations, arts centers, alternative spaces, residency programs, community-based initiatives, foundations, and galleries. A deepening understanding of non-profits arts management including mission and vision, leadership, sustainability, relationships to the community and the public will occur. We will ask whom do they serve, what is their relevancy, and what qualitative results do they achieve? The off-campus visits and on-campus guests will serve as core information to researching and proposing a start-up non-profit, analyzing non-profits, or developing successful residency applications. This course will be of special interest to studio practitioners and educators whose professional lives are likely to intersect with arts organizations and agencies in the future.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOR ELEMENTARY VISUAL ARTS LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course with its focus on curriculum development and pedagogical practices for students in elementary school has been designed as a  the companion to TLAD-612G where the focus is students in secondary school. In this way, this pair of courses provides graduate students with an essential foundation to teaching the visual arts (art and design) from pre-K to 12th grade.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course provides students with insights and experiences in studio-based teaching and learning through the lens of an elementary setting. Students will be introduced to curricular and pedagogical practices that are grounded in meaning making and artistic inquiry, as well as authentic forms of assessment. There is a special emphasis within this course on approaching each of these frameworks (curriculum, instruction, and assessment) through an understanding of the developmental needs - cognitive, social, and personal - of young children.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Within this course, students will engage in curriculum design and lesson planning through the development of a series of units that are grounded in enduring ideas in art and design education. Additionally, students will have the opportunity to engage in micro teaching experiences in partnership with a local elementary school classroom. They will have the opportunity to teach a carefully designed art/design lesson to a group of elementary-aged children and have the chance to thoughtfully reflect on their own teaching practices and encounters in the classroom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement for MAT, MA elective; MAT &amp; MA students only.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT FOR SECONDARY VISUAL ARTS LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course with its focus on curriculum development and pedagogical practices for students in grades 7-12 has been designed as the companion to TLAD-611G, where the focus is students in grades PK-6.  In this manner, this pair of courses provides graduate students with an essential foundation to teaching the Visual Arts (art and design) from pre-K to 12th grade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for students in grades 7-12 that aligns with the National Visual Arts Standards (NVAS). The course is guided by the belief all middle and high school students have creative capacity and that visual arts education plays an extraordinarily important role in its development.  Further, the course places emphasis on instructional design that encourages curiosity, discovery, creativity and importantly personal point of view.  Throughout the course, there is a focus on curriculum development and pedagogical strategies crafted to meet the cognitive and social development of learners as well as the personal interests of students while simultaneously introducing the work of a diverse range artists from historic to contemporary as models of practice.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design education that is informed by the graduate student's personal artistic practice combined with their understanding of the rich diversity of human visual expression. The course places special emphasis on the development of studio-based learning that centers on the intersecting domains of making and responding.  In this way, curriculum and instruction is designed to deepen secondary students' (7-12) understanding of art and design as expression of enduring ideas. Graduate students examine these concepts through their own studio practice, critical readings, the development curriculum maps and lesson plans and through an integrated practicum experience that provides an authentic opportunity to implement instruction with high school students in the TLAD-Studio Lab.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement for MAT, MA elecitve; MAT &amp; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTIST &amp; DESIGNER AS TEACHER: SCHOOL, MUSEUM, COMMUNITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides students from any major with the opportunity to explore issues in art and design teaching. As a broad overview, this course will address formal and informal art teaching in K-12 school-based settings, as well as in art museums, and community-based settings. Students will be introduced to ideas about teaching and learning art through a wide variety of experiences, such as observations in diverse art education settings, guest speakers, as well as opportunities interacting with (and teaching!) children and/or adolescents. This course will include seminar sessions, as well as site visits to local schools, museums, and community-based organizations. The content and experiences offered during this class hope to inspire and excite students about the possibilities of utilizing their studio practice as art &amp; design teachers or teaching artists in museum or community-based settings. The course will have particular value  to students perhaps considering continuing their studies at RISD beyond undergrad to pursue either a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) or Master of Arts (MA) in Art + Design Education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues and practices in art education through a variety of spaces. The course content will be divided approximately into three distinct explorations: art and design teaching at the K-12 schools, art museum education, and community-based art teaching. During each exploration, students will be asked to reflect on their own personal experiences with art learning, as well as engage with readings that explore contemporary perspectives on art education. Additionally, each exploration will be enhanced with opportunities for students to experience authentic art education spaces (either digitally or in person) to see how theory can connect with practice. The course culminates in a capstone experience in which students, collaborating in small groups, will lead a short studio-based experience for children or adolescents. This experience will be conducted in partnership with a local education organization such as a school, community arts center or RISD's Project Open Door. Throughout this class, students will be offered a variety of opportunities to connect art education theory and practice, as well as reflect on their own experiences with art learning and teaching.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Department of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design requires MA candidates submit a capstone thesis in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Candidates are given a degree of flexibility in determining the format for this work, but typically it takes the form of either a thesis monograph essay or a thesis book. The thesis monograph essay provides candidates with the opportunity to focus on a deep investigation of a single subject framed within the context of learning and through art and design. An essential characteristic of this approach to the thesis is in how it provides evidence of the candidate's ability to move beyond description to analysis and how they are able to place the subject of investigation within the realm of scholarship. The thesis book provides a candidate with the opportunity to make sense of their journey through their program in a more autobiographical and documentary manner. The thesis book format affords candidates the opportunity to explore how form can be exploited to visualize research. Whether presented as a thesis monograph essay or thesis book, this capstone requirement provides MA candidates with a formal opportunity to make public their understanding about a specific aspect of the nature of arts learning gained through their coursework, excursions into the scholarly literature and fieldwork experiences. The purpose here, therefore, is to conceive of the thesis not merely as an academic exercise but also contributing to program development as well as providing a reservoir of understandings that will inform the candidate's future professional practice as an educator.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: MARKING AND MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media, yet drawing can be independent of all other media. How can we make our drawing ventures resonant or challenging? Through independent studio production and focused critique, the course provides graduate students from any major the opportunity to more deeply understand the nature of drawing through a series of self-directed and self-paced experiences and investigations. Coursework may be referenced or supported by historical and contemporary contexts. Digital works, a single drawing medium or tool, phenomenal means, or other materials or mixtures of instruments can be used for mark-making. A full spectrum of drawing ways and ideas can be explored. The class is structured around cross-major conversations in small group critiques, peer-exchange critiques, larger group reviews and individual analysis. Drawings from this course may integrate or extend other areas of graduate students' study, including thesis content and personal visual inquiries. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
