   <COURSETITLE>RACE AND REPAIR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Race and Repair will explore each department of the RISD Museum turning a critical eye on its collections, collecting and curatorial practices in search of a deeper understanding of how racial identity and racial justice work (repair) occurs or could occur in or through the Museum. This will be paired with readings on racial identity formation in the United States; racial identity in museum practice; reconciliation/repair projects that have been initiated by museums, activists and communities; the intersection of wealth, privilege, politics and collecting; interpreting racial identity in museums; and the work of activist/artist curators like Fred Wilson and museum activist groups like #MuseumsRespondToFerguson.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through the course students will: &lt;BR&gt; .	Learn the principles of critical race theory and the history of race in America &lt;BR&gt; .	Be trained in how to facilitate race dialogues &lt;BR&gt; .	Delve into the RISD Museum's collection in search of items that can be used to generate thoughtful race dialogues &lt;BR&gt; .	Gain a deeper understanding of the history of curatorial work and how racial identity can affect curatorial practice &lt;BR&gt; .	Attempt new ways of seeing, understanding and tagging old objects in the museum's collection - part of their mid-session assignment &lt;BR&gt; .	Think critically about museum collecting practices and what types of repair work may be needed &lt;BR&gt; .	Propose new exhibitions that engage in the power/challenge of racial identity and the possibility of repair.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO BASIC SHOEMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many steps are involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Restricted to Apparel Design juniors and above &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as ID-2494 for ID majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DEFUSING DOOMSDAY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Communicating natural and technological risk. Artists and designers are increasingly engaged in projects related to na-tech risks: combined natural and technological hazards (e.g., the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi powerplant triggered by the Tohoku Tsunami). Risk communication regarding these kinds of events involves a wide range of issues including uncertainty and probability, social, and cultural factors, and questions of equity and justice. Whether you are working as an independent artist raising awareness or as a consultant to multi-national corporation, it is important to understand how communications regarding these hazards may backfire and even undermine your stated intentions (e.g., informing the public or encouraging mitigation of the hazard). This course is designed to equip students with a foundation in the social science of visual rhetoric and risk perception so that they may productively and ethically engage in risk communication. In addition to developing a risk communication strategy related to their interests and work, students will participate in mock surveys and other activities that illustrate the possibilities and limitations of social scientific research into risk perception. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL HAZARDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscape architects and designers in other disciplines are taking an increasingly important role in addressing complex questions related to climate change and natural hazards.  These questions involve intersecting cultural and scientific issues.  This course is designed to equip landscape architects and other designers with an essential foundation in physical and social scientific aspects of climate change so that they may better engage with these questions.  Although it is impossible to cover the breadth of necessary topics and issues in a single semester, students will learn to analyze and access the scientific literature so that they can individually extend their education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emphasis will also be placed on essential skills and disciplinary approaches to enable more effective collaboration in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts.  This includes addressing cultural and disciplinary differences in approaches to scientific concepts such as validity and uncertainty, and examining epistemological aspects of science.  This course is an essential primer in climate change and natural hazards for any student who hopes to address these issues in their work or to work in policy based contexts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open undergraduates only; sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as LAEL-2012; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN RESEARCH IN THE SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Artists and designers working on issues involving the sciences (e.g., global environmental change, environmental justice, human perception) routinely cross disciplinary boundaries to create new work that incorporates scientific knowledge. This course is designed to support students seeking to engage the sciences and to help students better understand the relationship between their practice-based education and other conventions of knowledge creation. The course has two primary focuses: &lt;br&gt; 1)	Assisting students with individual research, including the development of a research question, background, and statement of how disciplinary knowledge in the sciences relates to their art and design practice.  &lt;br&gt; 2)	Exploring the changing basis of legitimacy for knowledge in different disciplinary contexts. &lt;br&gt; At the end of the course students will be equipped with a background document suitable for use in grant proposals, be better able to present and articulate their art and design ideas to collaborators in the sciences, and better understand the different approaches scientific collaborators take to addressing research and societal problems.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN FASHION THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Topics in Fashion Theory" complements the design history survey, "History of Dress." ("History of Dress" is not a prerequisite). This seminar will introduce students to theoretical debates in fashion theory, responding to scholars who define fashion as the cultural construction of embodied identity. Through the manipulation of the visual and tactile symbols of clothing (cut, cloth, texture and color) fashion expresses, however imprecisely, a configuration of individual attributes and attitudes that persons seek to communicate. But fashion most likely productively draws upon "recurrent instabilities" in collective social identities, argues Fred Davis, including masculinity versus femininity, androgyny versus singularity, license versus restraint and conformity versus rebellion. Fashion can do so because social identities are rarely the stable amalgams we take them to be: they shift over the course of a lifetime and are prodded by social and technological change. Drawing on scholarship in a range of disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, gender studies and queer theory, we will explore clothing's role in marking, or alternately containing, deflecting or sublimating, those aspects of identity linked to gender, sexuality, class, race, religion and nation. Noting that leading designers use the catwalk to present experimental clothes that often communicate brand values and the designer's identity, we will explore the extent to which fashion is currently formulating effective social commentary. &lt;BR&gt; The class integrates reading and reading responses with discussion and visual analysis of clothing and fashion across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Reading responses will help students develop four short written projects that assess and analyze debates encountered in class discussion and readings. Class time will include in-class writing and peer review. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Apparel majors only; sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE USES OF ANIMALS IN RELATION TO THE INDUSTRY OF MAN: DESIGN AND NATURE, 1851 AND NOW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This hybrid studio-elective course will follow a  series of twelve lectures given at the South  Kensington Museum as published in P.L. Simmonds,  Animal Products. This seminal work served as a  compilation of the trade exhibition collections  from the 1851 Crystal Palace exposition that  eventually served as the seed for the collections  of the South Kensington Museum and finally the  Branch Museum of the Department at Bethnal Green.  These collections laid the foundation for much of  the Victoria and Albert Museum collections (V&amp;A)  that in turn influenced the creation of RISD and  the RISD Museum in 1877.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will examine design and fashion,  naturalist journals, and literature as a means to  develop the students design vocabulary and  materials palate. Students will compare the  tastes and techniques of the Victorian era to  contemporary design practices, with case studies  of designers utilizing the natural world as a  resource and source for design. Weekly lectures  will introduce students to artists and designers  of the 19th century  and compare them to  contemporary artists and designers. These  introductory lectures will be paired each week  with a specific material examination and hand-on  exploration via materials demonstrations and a  sample notebook. We will engage in readings,  group discussions, critique of student  "Naturalist Journals," materials demonstrations,  and examine historic and contemporary Museum  objects within each theme material.  &lt;BR&gt; Field trips to the RISD Museum will be augmented  by visits to the Edna W. Lawrence Nature Lab,  RISD Materials library, The Providence Athenaeum,  The Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown  University, The New Bedford Whaling Museum, and  The Museum of Natural History, Roger Williams  Park.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost:  $20.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to Apparel Design majors only; sophomore and  above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and  permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This Apparel course has an interdisciplinary approach and is a fusion of fashion, art and interactive design, imagining future wearables with a focus on integrating digital and physical realities. Students will explore and imagine innovative user experiences and connectivity through the investigation and development of hybrid materials and wearable prototypes that are seamlessly integrated on, in, around and between the body.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will be exposed to current market wearable trends and artists whose work provokes and embraces emerging technologies through a series of lectures, investigative research assignments, material and three- dimensional explorations to inform the making of a final project. Workshops are designed to expose students to basic apparel techniques and provide a fundamental working knowledge of this process as well as explore wearable electronic components with a hands-on approach.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In tandem with workshops, students will individually or collaboratively work on a narrative/ concept through continued research and design methodologies that will inform their final project thereby creating a fully realized working "artifact" executed by the end of the semester.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students are required to document their entire design process on-line or in a sketchbook. All homework assignments, photographs of three-dimensional exploration, design sketches, illustrations, concept images, research, and a written narrative/concept statement will be documented for weekly review. Apparel design processes and professional practices, such as work room specification sheets and muslin development will be taught, implemented and are mandatory as students move from concept/sketch to prototypes for evaluation.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THEORY SEMINAR: MAKING DISCOURSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a theoretical seminar course that will be concerned with ideas and architectural knowledge that may be cultivated and tested through discourse.  The course discussions will focus on an expansive role of architectural tools. While acknowledging a wealth of disciplinary conventions, histories and theories, this course recognizes that the forms of representation within the discipline of architecture have the capacity to affect the discipline of architecture and are not fixed. Students in this course will be expected to build upon their previous architectural education through a series of directed projects aimed at advancing architectural theories, ideas and methods. Some of the questions that students will be expected to address are: What are the practical, theoretical, and creative implications of a drawing that functions as architecture? How do architects change the way we make and think thanks to digital media? How do architects represent and model natural forces?  How do architects express political or social agendas?  What is the nature of an architectural contribution to interdisciplinary discourse? How can representation enable new kinds of artistic and research-based practices for architecture? Students will be expected to self-direct their process while framing their work intellectually in a seminar environment. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate Major requirement; Architecture 2-year majors only &lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year M.ARCH Advanced Standing students only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department,  course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on computational topics pertaining to architecture. Computational techniques and computational ideas are explored through making, writing, reading, and discussion. Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; For Fall and Spring Semesters:  &lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to CTC Concentrators and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; For Wintersession:  &lt;br&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS DISCURSIVE WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thesis Discursive Workshop utilizes Wintersession to hone students' discursive skills, both written and oral, so that they can choreograph a robust discussion around their work. This course establishes a consistent discursive trajectory to the ongoing individual design development of the thesis project that begins in the Fall. In addition to providing a forum in which students might draw out, articulate, and position some of the central claims and aims of their thesis work, this course also aims to instigate careful thought about the written component of the eventual thesis book and the way that this written component might inform or be informed by design work. The assignments of the course are designed to create the infrastructure of a student's eventual thesis book, the elements of any/many book(s). They are not the book content itself, but organize, clarify, define, contextualize, reference, etc. the work contained therein. These elements, for the purposes of this course, are: synopsis (back page/cover flap summary), "cover art", bibliography, table of contents, title, index, and appendix/appendices. In this five-week intensive workshop, students will develop and refine the following skills, relating each development to a component of their eventual book via an assignment:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. Crafting the thesis polemic or narrative;  &lt;BR&gt; 2. Positioning the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 3. Contextualizing and formatting the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 4. Curating and editing the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 5. Persuasively articulating the thesis. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $200.00 &lt;I&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Schedule to be determined with Advisor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

Directed Design Research is an alternative to Thesis, which lays out a specific territory of inquiry and encourages students to identify the topic and scope of their work, emanating from this specific point of departure. The seminar will lay out a series of methods, techniques, and exercises related to the exploration of measure, asking each student to then define a territory of inquiry within this delimited field. The deliverables for the Scope Seminar include a thoughtfully delimited and actionable statement of the intended design research, the documentation of a minimum of three methodologies or approaches to be utilized in the design research, and a well-wrought syllabus that includes: a weekly breakdown of tasks and deliverables, relevant references and precedents properly cited, and a concise text (3 pages maximum) describing the research activities to be undertaken. &lt;br&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING THE COSMOS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Cosmos is a universe regarded as an orderly complete and harmonious system. "Designing The Cosmos" is a studio that brings the opportunity to all interested RISD students to create and design their own physical and diverse Universe. During this course, the students will use Reverse Engineering to understand the Universe as a whole and deconstruct it at different scales. The student will design their own Universe, Solar systems,and Planets. Students will explore their new city and lifestyles of their own personalized planet through models and drawings. The Episcopal Cleric Desmond Tutu said that "We inhabit a universe that is characterized by diversity", therefore, the purpose of the course is to encourage students to re-envision the cosmos as a potential to discover the value of diversity and be able to materialize it in a physical reality. A universe could be defined as "a particular sphere of activity, interest, or experience." As architects and artists we design a sphere of activity, our own interests and experiences. To us designing the cosmos pushes students forward, to analyze our current realm and push what the world can possibly become by designing a totally new universe! Art and architecture need creative thinkers, we believe by exploring the potential of the cosmos one can be free from social "norms" and truly explore where one's mind can take them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Prompts: &lt;BR&gt; In this course the use of physical model making, digital modeling, and drawing will allow students to explore the scope of space and its limits. &lt;BR&gt; 1. Create a physical model that explores the volume of space that exists around your idea of a universe. Your universe will exist as a void within set parameters of the volume. &lt;BR&gt; 2. Imagine within the void live star clusters, explore how these stars exist in space. &lt;BR&gt; 3. Define the motion of what lives around your stars. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;/br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS DISCURSIVE WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thesis Discursive Workshop utilizes Wintersession to hone students' discursive skills, both written and oral, so that they can choreograph a robust discussion around their work. This course establishes a consistent discursive trajectory to the ongoing individual design development of the thesis project that begins in the Fall. In addition to providing a forum in which students might draw out, articulate, and position some of the central claims and aims of their thesis work, this course also aims to instigate careful thought about the written component of the eventual thesis book and the way that this written component might inform or be informed by design work. The assignments of the course are designed to create the infrastructure of a student's eventual thesis book, the elements of any/many book(s).

   <COURSETITLE>FABRICATING URBANITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>	This studio aims to question place-making through the critical analysis of both the urban and the form, and the examination of the shifting scales of architecture and the built environment. Students will first be asked to study urbanism through an analytic exploration into Providence, examining the human relationship to the city and its setting. Guided by a brief background of urban design basics, students will be assigned a site as a focus their study, that will later become the location of their design intervention. Through an ongoing process of drawing and modeling, students will engage in an integral process of formal making as experimentation into the relationship between scale and human encounter.   	These analytical observations will be recorded both in two-dimensional and three-dimensional forms, which will be referenced throughout the course and ultimately will become the basis to their final design intervention. Using the knowledge and questions gained from the examination of form and scale, students will be asked to design and fabricate a site-specific installation focused on human interaction as the creation of space and place. There is no limit to material, scale, use, medium, or form. Depending on size students will thus fabricate their design to scale, keeping in mind materiality, representation, and the encounter. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00-$500.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on computational topics pertaining to architecture. Computational techniques and computational ideas are explored through making, writing, reading, and discussion. Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; For Fall and Spring Semesters:  &lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to CTC Concentrators and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; For Wintersession:  &lt;br&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS DISCURSIVE WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thesis Discursive Workshop utilizes Wintersession to hone students' discursive skills, both written and oral, so that they can choreograph a robust discussion around their work. This course establishes a consistent discursive trajectory to the ongoing individual design development of the thesis project that begins in the Fall. In addition to providing a forum in which students might draw out, articulate, and position some of the central claims and aims of their thesis work, this course also aims to instigate careful thought about the written component of the eventual thesis book and the way that this written component might inform or be informed by design work. The assignments of the course are designed to create the infrastructure of a student's eventual thesis book, the elements of any/many book(s). They are not the book content itself, but organize, clarify, define, contextualize, reference, etc. the work contained therein. These elements, for the purposes of this course, are: synopsis (back page/cover flap summary), "cover art", bibliography, table of contents, title, index, and appendix/appendices. In this five-week intensive workshop, students will develop and refine the following skills, relating each development to a component of their eventual book via an assignment:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. Crafting the thesis polemic or narrative;  &lt;BR&gt; 2. Positioning the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 3. Contextualizing and formatting the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 4. Curating and editing the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 5.

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUILDING PRINTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course brings together printmaking and architecture, with their respective modes of working and sensibilities. There is long tradition connecting the two disciplines; here we will focus on a fundamental, physical connection, experimenting with materials and ways of assembling them to make prints. We will think of the press bed almost as a construction site. Collecting materials from everyday life, we will explore their characteristics and qualities--textures, patterns, opacities and translucencies--in the process of transferring them onto paper. The main technique of the course will be monotype, but we may also employ other techniques, such as soft ground and laser etching depending of students' experience and interest. We will start with simple monochrome prints, progressively moving to more open-ended, elaborate and ambitious experiments, including multicolor prints and three-dimensional assemblages. Students will produce weekly sets of prints in order to develop themes and variations. Above all, the work of the course should be thought of as an opportunity to develop careful experimental habits.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2080: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; PRINT-2080: Open to Printmaking majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2080: Open to all other majors.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN FARM: GATHERING - LEARNING FROM COMMUNITY GARDEN PRACTICES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is sponsored by the RISD SEI Action Plan. The course addresses the plan's call for meaningful Community Engagement (VI) and Community Wellness (VII) by recognizing the power of affiliating with members of our local community and with natural systems.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Urban agriculture has the potential to strengthen local communities with many social benefits including; enhancing food security with healthy food, the reduction of the use of fossil-fuels, and local economic development within the food network. It also creates more sustainable urban environments with green spaces that re-establish interrelated natural systems, promoting biodiversity and reducing urban impact on the water cycle. Finally, these spaces can be a locus for the neighborhood. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will focus on creative place making and contemporary urban agriculture practices.  We will work closely with Southside Community Land Trust and Down City Design in South Providence as community partners to understand and support their work through creative thinking. Class time will be divided between field trips, working collaboratively in the city with our partners, and working quietly in the classroom.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Each student will be asked to prepare two projects. The first will be a case study analysis of existing examples of urban farms across the country to learn from the unique ways people are farming in different cities. In the second, we will work with our community partners in the fields and on a small design-build project situated at an existing garden.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to students in Architecture, Interior Architecture, Landscape Architecture and Industrial Design. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2340; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIA PERSPECTIVES: HISTORY OF MEDIA ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this historical survey, we analyze the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. We examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged. We make connections across decades by focusing on the recurring themes of language, futurism, simulation, hyper-reality, transnationality and information. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; D+M majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year graduate students. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by D+M Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Participants in the Technological Landscapes research group are passionate but critical observers of today's living environment in relation to ubiquitous, integrated, and emerging technologies. It is important that we draw inspiration not necessarily just from art, design, but from real-world events influenced or caused by technological advancement and/or failure.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This research group will foster a dynamic, and highly collaborative environment through discussions, readings and excursions. Participants are expected to drive and determine the focus and interests of the group through conversations and consensus. In turn this will feed each participant's artistic sensibility and will form the conceptual foundations necessary for building a strong critical art work. Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  The projects, individual or collaborative, should be thought of on a scale of landscape physical or virtual. One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $200.00  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required. Course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Please contact the Instructor with any questions and for more details. &lt;BR&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Participants in the Technological Landscapes research group are passionate but critical observers of today's living environment in relation to ubiquitous, integrated, and emerging technologies. It is important that we draw inspiration not necessarily just from art, design, but from real-world events influenced or caused by technological advancement and/or failure.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This research group will foster a dynamic, and highly collaborative environment through discussions, readings and excursions. Participants are expected to drive and determine the focus and interests of the group through conversations and consensus. In turn this will feed each participant's artistic sensibility and will form the conceptual foundations necessary for building a strong critical art work. Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  The projects, individual or collaborative, should be thought of on a scale of landscape physical or virtual. One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $200.00  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required. Course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Please contact the Instructor with any questions and for more details. &lt;BR&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar course analyzes the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. As a group, we will examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we will address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt; Within this course, students will be expected to identify, analyze, and critique readings that critically inform and underwrite the foundations of their written thesis and studio practice. Students will contribute to the focus of the course through discussions and writings that contextualize their own work as it relates to critical theory. Class time will be mainly used for discussion of readings and concepts, critique of work and to introduce methods and theory. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; D+M majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year graduate students. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by D+M Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FLOWERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>People send flowers when you're ill, when you're well, when you're born and when you die. We print flowers on clothing, we stitch flowers on upholstery, we paper our walls with flowers. They appear in songs, plays, poems and food. Flowers adorn our architecture, furniture, clothing and bodies. We use perfume to smell like flowers. We name our children after flowers. The world is (nothing but) flowers.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In this studio/seminar students will be exploring flowers as both artistic subject and medium. The class will gain a deeper understanding of how flowers have been used throughout art history; from 17th Century Dutch still life to Obama's presidential portrait. In order to comprehend the semiotics of flowers we will investigate how the their meanings vary between traditions, locations, time periods and cultures through class lectures, assigned readings, guest speakers and field trips. Students will also learn some basic botany, species identification and care.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The goal of the course is to inspire student investigation and expand their visual and critical vocabulary. They will discover and define their own practice of artistic research, a methodology which can be applied to any topic or subject. Students will present work regularly in class for critique. The work, however, can take any form; from pencil drawings to virtual reality. Students are responsible for folding the topics and themes discussed in the course into their own practice. The intention of the course is to inspire work, not dictate it.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Technology is becoming a part of every conversation we have. What influence does it have, and how can we leverage it to create new possibilities? The objective of this course is to create and work with physical materials through the lens of technology. This class explores the various ways material may be analyzed, generated, and affected by computation. We'll be exploring how our day to day art practice can be enhanced by media and technology. Technological components will be incorporated in experimental media creation. This course is intended for object-makers who wish to introduce motion and technology into their sculpture, installation, performance, etc... Historical and contemporary works will be presented and discussed to provide a context for studio projects. Class time will consist of discussions, critiques for projects, technical workshops, trouble-shooting, studio visits, and 1 on 1 meetings. Students will be introduced to Arduino, motors, sensors, and microcontrollers in the making of art.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO PROJECTION MAPPING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Introduction to Projection Mapping is a studio-based course focused on using projection mapping as a way to combine physical and virtual spaces together. Projection Mapping is using technology to project objects onto a surface. The purpose of this technique is to stay away from flat screen projecting. This class serves as a comprehensive introduction to methods for creating projection mapping for beginners. Our exercise during the studio will be recognizing how the video content relates to the shape of the surface, making animation, and projecting onto a simple 2 or 3-dimensional surface through mapping skills. Using a combination of media, such as photography, video, animation, sound, sculpture, and installation, you will learn the basic principles behind projection mapping and then apply them to a final project that will involve a 3D projection map on an art object of your choice. You will design a video and sound component that will be mapped onto your object, bringing it to life and challenging the viewer's perception through a clever use of light and sound. During the course, you also will learn how to scale up your work for a large gallery or an architectural application. In the discussion section, students will discuss how mapping allows an audience to experience an augmented reality in which virtual space and reality overlap, as well as the expanded illusion of space in projection mapping. Historical and contemporary works of projection mapping will be presented and assigned for analysis. After Effects, Cinema 4D, Madmapper and Millumin will be the main softwares for the class.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ART OF GOING VIRAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the year 2018, social media is more that just a platform to message your friends; it is the primary means in which we consume the majority of our information.  People are living more and more of their lives online, which in turn means that art itself is existing more and more on these platforms as well.  The artist who does not embrace platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Tumblr for their work is the artist who will be left behind in the dust.  Yes, you can take a class on tools like laser cutting or gouache or Final Cut, but it is social media platforms are arguably the most powerful tool at an artist's disposal.  If an artist wants their work to reach the masses, they are better off mastering the art of going viral than they are getting their art into the Met.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This is a studio and seminar based course. For the seminar aspect of this class, we will focus on various questions such as: How has our consumption of art changed as social media has evolved?  Have these platforms enhanced or hurt art?  What is even the definition of "art" on social media?  Is a meme art?  What about a GIF or a youtube video?  What makes a piece of art go viral...and does "viral" necessarily make it "good"? How as artists can we take advantage of "viralness"?  For the studio portion of this class, students will have the opportunity to create a number of social media based art projects with the goal being to make their work go viral. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This interdisciplinary studio course explores the critical perspectives of internet-based performance art. Students will be provided with the conceptual frameworks and historical contexts necessary to make compelling performances that either exist on the internet or make use of networked technologies like routers and IP cameras. Students may perform using their bodies, simple machines, twitter bots, or any medium of choice for one's followers, algorithms, strangers, trolls, and even viewers IRL. If a platform exists online, whether it is YouTube or email, Yelp or Reddit, then it is relevant to this course and ripe for performance. We will analyze performances by Ann Hirsch, Dynasty Handbag, Jayson Musson, and Michael Mandiberg; and read work by Hito Steyerl, Marvin Carlson, Micha Crdenas, and many more. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics.

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Introduction to Computation focuses on computational techniques, methods, and ideas in the context of art and design. Studio projects first center on the design of algorithms then shift to involve computer programming and scripting. Critical attention is given to code as a body of crafted text with significant aesthetic, philosophical, and social dimensions, as well as the tension, conflict, and potential possible when computation generates, informs, or interacts with drawings, materials, forms, and spaces. Historical and contemporary works of computational art and design will be presented and assigned for analysis. This course is open to students of all majors and is designed for those with little or no experience in programming. In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer. This course fulfills one of two core studio requirements for CTC Concentration. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt; Apply during registration period using the form found here: https://goo.gl/forms/oARSYmuhjYrNczVZ2 or go to ctc.risd.edu. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>CTC Concentration Project is a required, advanced course for all CTC Concentrators taken after a student has earned 12 CTC credits. In this course, students develop and complete a large scale project that draws from the students' prior studies in the CTC Concentration. Students write source code, author software, and program hardware for making their own works of art and design. Complementing this work, students engage in critical discourse surrounding computation, technology, and culture through dialogue and writing. Coding as a technology with implications for making and authorship is explored through a pedagogy of code sharing and collaborative learning. Differences in programming cultures across languages and disciplines is one of the motive forces in this course. Throughout the semester, seminar discussions are organized around canonical computational texts. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration Requirement; CTC Concentrators only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a practical and conceptual exploration into electronic sensors, processors and actuators in the context of interactive art and design. Students will turn everyday objects into "ambient interfaces" or "responsive systems" that respond to the conditions of the human body, data networks, and the environment. Contemporary works of art and design - from kinetic sculpture and sound art to installation, architecture and product design - will be examined through readings and presentations. Open source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with the fundamentals of electronic circuitry. Emphasis is given to the development of creative projects (individual or collaborative), followed by an iterative implementation process (planning, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining). The course is structured around a series of tutorials and exercises, culminating in a final project. Students also present work-in-progress and prototypes during class reviews to receive qualitative feedback from the class and the instructor. Participants will engage with physical computing conceptually and technically in their studio work and are encouraged to leverage their individual backgrounds to excel in the respective context. Prior experience with electronics and programming is recommended but not required.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is about drawing space in full dimensions, so that your own perspective can be brought out most vividly. How do we inhabit and perceive space, how do we imagine space, and how can those experiences and conceptual paradigms be conveyed through visual forms? Academic drawing techniques often presume a flattening of space in order to transcribe the haptic, visual field onto a 2D surface. Instead, we will try to track the complete, embodied perceptual experience as we strive to arrive at drawing approaches that can record and convey individual senses of space. The final, independent project will transfer these practices into media and ideas that are individual and inventive. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>So much of our lives now involve transitions through digital and physical spaces. How can creative processes reflect and take advantage of these transitions? As pressure grows on creatives of all fields to "generate content" we can look to contemporary procedural generation models in video games as well as the history of generative systems in art and design to challenge the limits of quick and unique production models. &lt;bR&gt; Students will create new works through workshops focused on rapid transitions in printing, digital editing, physical manipulation, and photography. We will study contemporary forms of generative systems, such as procedural generation in games, as well as the rich history of generative systems in art and design, to reconfigure language and goals for in-class workshops. Subjects looked at will range from Minecraft, No Man's Sky, Dwarf Fortress, Nethack, and John Conway's Game of Life to the generative systems of Franois Morellet, Channa Horwitz, Charles Gaines, Sol LeWitt, and Hanne Darboven. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as DM-2034; Register in the course  for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEEING MACHINES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Seeing Machines" are imaging technologies that produce and distribute pictures. (1) Google maps, surveillance networks, museum digital archives, QR codes, and facial recognition systems are some examples. Their quantity and reach is vast: more images are being created by these systems today than the combined sum of all images before the year 2000. In 2017, picture production largely happens within automated networks, distributed by computers in a massive flow of data, (and most won't ever be seen by the human eye).  This class will explore how artists intervene and subvert Seeing Machines' tools-scripts, programs, automation and other technologies- to systematize, classify and distribute images.  Through a set of projects, student-led presentations, readings and discussions, we will understand how Seeing Machines operate and control, and create methods to make artwork in response. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-concentrators pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Over thousands of years, the materials and methods of drawing have evolved in response to the needs of artists and designers. Technical manuals, patents and other texts record specific drawing techniques. Research into these sources will lead to making actual drawing materials - inks, quill pens, grounds for metal point, chalks, etc. - which will be tested through a range of personal drawing projects and copies of historical works. Trials of newly available drawing materials will yield information about potential uses and permanency. Best practices for care and display of drawings will be covered throughout the course. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $90.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to undergraduates only; sophomore and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

This includes a thorough study of traditional 'story film' screenwriting, as well as writing techniques for documentary production and preproduction writing problems, such as proposals, treatments, and outlines. It is also a study of nontraditional writing problems in filmmaking: writing for nonlinear or experimental films, writing for a framework for improvisation, using text as a direct generator of filmed work, and even using text as the content of film.  And last, but certainly not least, there is considerable attention paid to developing skills in critical writing. By the end of this course, students will have a portfolio of written work, including a polished draft of a short film or long-form first act, which demonstrates a wide variety of techniques for relating the written word to media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $25.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>DIRECTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the Directing class, students are encouraged to go beyond the first instinct or idea, and to develop a project to its fullest potential, particularly with respect to meaning and to potential modes of execution. Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY CINEMA PRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Intro Film explores techniques of live action 16MM film production using Bolex cameras and flatbed editing tables. Technical concerns such as exposure, focus, depth of field, and basic editing conventions are covered. Aesthetic concerns such as composition, movement, editing rhythms, and the filmmaker's intention are discussed and critiqued. Students complete three individual assignments outside of class, and four in-class exercises in pairs or groups. The individual assignments encourage creative use of editing techniques such as traditional match-cutting, graphic match-cutting, and cross-cutting or parallel editing. The first individual project is silent, but for those that follow, students create soundtracks using elements such as effects, music, ambient sound, and voiceover.  Screenings in class include student rushes, works in progress, and finished films. In addition, a variety of short films are screened and discussed that relate to many of the techniques and aesthetic considerations explored throughout the semester. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $220.00  Deposit: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement &lt;BR&gt; Registration by FAV Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required for non-majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMATION INTEGRATION/INSTALLATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio investigates the use of animation as an art form integrated into a cross-disciplinary practice using installation, performance and interactivity. This is different from traditional animation filmmaking in that students are instead exploring variations of the constructed cinematic object and the engagement of the human body as an active participant in the cinematic schema. The student uses the tenets of animation to consider the (de/re)construction of sequential image, identities of transmission and reception, the context of the projected image and light, the monitor as receptacle, motorized optical machines, environment and location. The course includes lectures, demonstrations, project workshops and studio practice. Emphasis is placed upon the conceptual, material, practical and creative approaches to reconsidering and re-making what animation is and can be. The course culminates with final projects. Prior animation experience is not necessary.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of Instructor Required. Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER ANIMATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>STOP-MOTION ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course demonstrating and exploring the basic techniques of Stop-Motion Puppet Animation, with the intent to provide students with hands-on creative experience in learning the potentials of the medium, and an introduction to filmic language. Studio exercises strengthen individual technical skills in basic armature construction and model making, animating pose-to-pose movement, the basic walk, expressions and gestures, clay animation with lip-sync, set construction and lighting for three-dimensional animation. Basic sound recording, mixing and editing are also covered. Conceptual skills are exercised through exploring intent, storytelling, storyboarding, editorial concepts, character performance, art direction, and basic sound design. This class is based on process and experimentation. It is meant to provide a strong foundation in the basics of stop-motion animation filmmaking, as well as the confidence to experiment further in one's future work. The idea is to enjoy the process by understanding it; control is born of experimentation and experience. &lt;BR&gt; This is a one semester class repeated in the spring.

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a study of the theories and methods of character design as applied to narrative forms. This class asks students to push beyond stereotypical designs to develop two-dimensional characters that are both personally and culturally resonant and imaginative.  Particular emphasis is placed on the expressive power of abstract forms and color. Through exploring individual perceptions of good and evil, success and failure, as well as beauty and ugliness, students create characters that are highly original. Research, thorough craftsmanship, and sophisticated design are stressed. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRE-PRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Pre-production is an integral part of film and media production. This course examines the methods filmmakers and media artists use to clarify ideas and approaches to a work prior to making it.  These methods include pre-visualizations, production design, location scouting, casting, rehearsal, scheduling, creating production books, budgeting, and making script breakdowns. The course will focus on methods that allow a team to share a vision, consider priorities, and create realistic expectations prior to realizing a project. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course will examine a diverse array of practices, relevant to moving- image forms including fiction filmmaking, documentary filmmaking, and new-media production. Although many practices covered are rooted in traditional fiction filmmaking they can be adapted to new media forms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. Course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POST-PRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Post-production refers to the third stage (preproduction, production, post) of traditional cinematic workflow, when major media assets have been captured, and the priority of the filmmaker shifts to assembly, sequencing, combination, and preparation for exhibition and distribution.  Contemporary practice blurs these lines, where rapid turnaround and instant publication allow for virtually simultaneous shooting, sequencing, and distribution. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This studio course will begin with a thorough walkthrough, both technical and conceptual, of traditional postproduction techniques, with a heavy emphasis on managing projects, organizing, editing and sequencing of media, and fine-tune professionalization of material - including color grading, sound finishing, and deliverable design.  It will also explore new frontiers in simultaneous production, where everything is pre-, prod-, and post- at once, and look at how traditional frameworks for postproduction intersect and affect new modes. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Students should be familiar with basic production terminology and methods, cameras, and intro-level familiarity with digital video and audio.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $280.00 Deposit: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGINING AFTER CAPITALISM: A STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Someone once said that it is easier to imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism. (from Frederic Jameson's essay Future City) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Using the varied disciplines and tools we bring with us to this cross-disciplinary studio, Jameson's openly attributed quote launches us into an attempt to think-and above all to practice-our capacity to imagine a world after capitalism. A great deal of study and experience has revealed capitalism to be, at best, a limited ideology, and yet its all encompassing quality leaves us struggling to imagine our way in/around/through/after it. This course aims to increase our dexterity and our ease in being with/under/after capitalism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A growing body of artistic practice defines itself, explicitly or implicitly, as constituting attempts to resist, reveal, or re-imagine capitalism. Through researching some of these related artist practices, reading, and making group and individual projects, we will conduct a collective study of this pervasive political and economic ideology. Our study will take form through the research, production, and curious attention paid to a series of artworks that constitute attempts by each member of our study group, to imagine in/around/through capitalism. Works can take any form that is appropriate to our concerns. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to junior and above.</COURSEDESC>

As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The primary focus of the semester is an experimentally based investigation of bending and forming techniques - molded plywood, bent lamination, steam bending, and vacuum-formed plastic. While focused on the use of wood and plastic materials, an experimental approach is expected in the studio.  Students are encouraged to conceptually explore skills and materials to develop a personal design approach and studio practice.  The semester culminates in a final design, in which students utilize learned techniques to create one-offs, objects intended for batch production or prototypes designed for production. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Furniture Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design Department,  course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction. In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques such as crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way throughout the entire process. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design and Textiles Departments, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as TEXT-2523; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIGHTING DESIGN 101</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Lighting Kit Cost: $130.00 &lt;BR&gt; Elective for majors and non-majors &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

While the seminar format will encourage the content to be student driven, inclusive of diverse identities and responsive to changing contemporary concerns, there will be a core set of established readings such as Baudrillard, Marx, Benjamin, Adamson, Dunne and Raby, Clark, Attfield, McDonough, Appadurai and others, which provide a scholarly frame of reference and informed point of departure. Students will be encouraged to explore under-represented and new areas of inquiry related to their discipline and to articulate an original and informed point of view. The course will include workshops in research strategies and writing related to design and students will be expected to apply these developing skills to weekly assignments as well as to one longer term project. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective; Furniture Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors others pending seat  availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PARADIGM THINKING DESIGN SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Paradigm Thinking: How what we believe and think effects what we are able to perceive, imagine and therefore create.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A Paradigm is a model around which we construct our understanding of the world.  It determines what we believe and it determines what we think is real and valuable.  A paradigm is important because it determines not only what we perceive, but also what we are capable of perceiving and the manner in which we perceive it.  This class will address the fundamental concepts that underlie issues of Social Equity and Inclusion (SEI).  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this seminar course, students will be encouraged to critically explore their own paradigms, to cultivate flexibility in the development of their paradigm and to embrace uncertainty in an effort to reach beyond current human cognitive limitations in dealing with the psycho/social manifestations that underpin societal inequality.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There will be weekly reading and writing assignments, and a final essay chronicling the students' personal progress through the class. Instead of a final essay, students may choose to present a work of art or design that is indicative of their understanding of the course material.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ALTERNATIVE METALS FOR FURNITURE DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to metalworking through exploration of the material properties and fabrication techniques of brass, bronze, copper, aluminum and stainless steel as raw materials for furniture making. Students will develop a familiarity with these materials through lectures, demonstrations and self guided experimentation. Through the lens of these additional metals, students will expand upon their metalworking skills vis-a-vis cold and hot forming, welding, riveting and smithing as well as a broad range of metal finishing techniques. Proficiency will be evaluated throughout the class through student samples and small projects. This course will culminate with the production of one highly resolved furniture object which utilizes one or more of the above metals as a primary material. &lt;bR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00-$200.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE WOODEN OBJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Wood is a living material with time ingrained in its very fibers. It is highly malleable, yet it ultimately communicates what it can be as it moves and breathes over time. Wood has the potential to be crafted into the perfect tool, the perfect container, and the perfect object. In short, it is a material that has being.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  In this introductory course, we will be investigating the properties of solid wood through the making of a collection of tabletop objects. With demonstrations on wood turning, wood carving and the use of hand and machine tools, this class will help students discover the vast possibilities that wood has to offer as a material. Through the development of woodworking techniques and creation of a collection of small objects, we will explore the significance of the things we surround ourselves with. Students will be encouraged to develop ideas through the making of a turned mallet, a turned bowl, and a carved utensil. The final project is to design and create several keepsake objects that hold a significance to each maker and will be shown as a cohesive collection, incorporating either carved or turned components.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research elective class will focus on the myriad opportunities for the sustainable practice of design. The somewhat humbling point of departure is the fact that many, if not all, of the problems we currently face are the direct result of previous "design solutions". There are numerous topics to cover under each of the following domains. Our aim is to expose students to meaningful comprehensive and anticipatory sustainability thinking. The focus of the class will be on the development of a comprehensive, operationally useful "sustainability lens" through which to evaluate design decisions as they are being made in hopes of avoiding the Law of Unintended Consequences on the front end, rather than seeking to simply design without regard for the potentially negative outcomes that require fixing on the back end.    &lt;BR&gt; Material: The 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics, Material choice, material sourcing, life cycle analysis, the containment of entropy   &lt;BR&gt; Economic: Full Spectrum Accounting. Bring all externalities back onto the balance sheet   &lt;BR&gt; Life: Creating conditions conducive to life, Biomimetics: Learning from Nature not just about Nature. The preservation of biodiversity   &lt;BR&gt; Social: How does your object contribute to the quality of life for maker and user and other organisms, as well? Appropriate human behavior in the biosphere   &lt;BR&gt; Spiritual: An exploration of how students' work contributes to the "Great Work", embracing uncertainty and cultivating wonder  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Demonstrations will not linger on the technical but rather, will function as a catalyst for students to engage in an aesthetic and/or conceptual dialogue with technique and material. Both the studio process and the information presented in this class will encourage collaborative as well as individual work. This class will permit a deep investigation into the process of casting and into the innate properties of glass. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses. Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors, fifth-year and graduate students. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF GLASS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; junior BFA.GLASS students &lt;BR&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of Department Head or Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN OPTICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses. Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this studio/seminar, co-taught by a RISD artist and a Brown historian, we will examine how material attains meaning. Through demonstrations, workshops, lectures, and hands-on making, we will explore instruments used to understand materials in 16th and 17th-century Europe (e.g. microscopes, alchemical alembics, printed books). We will also consider how those devices have inspired contemporary art practice. Final projects, which may take a variety of forms, will interrogate the relationship between matter and the devices used to understand it.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to seniors and graduate students.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructior required.

   <COURSETITLE>FROM MEMORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class will examine the various ways that memory-or lack thereof-can be translated into the creation of work. Memory forever exists between acts of remembering and forgetting, and it is this struggle that produces feelings of longing, frustration, joy, and sadness. The space in which memory exists is where we begin to question the past, present and future. It is also where places, people and objects in our physical world become ideas, thoughts, and images. The primary objective of this class will be to harness the potential of our memories through reconstruction, preservation, and destruction. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; Meetings will be structured around discussions of the ephemeral existence of memory as well as the creation of physical manifestations of recollection. We will investigate this dichotomy through presentations, readings, film, demos, and workshops which will help students bridge the gap between the mental constructs of memory and the process of making.  &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; Participation and process will be focused on documenting thoughts, recollections and experiences within a memory journal, which will serve as a basis for making work. These entries will be shared, voluntarily, at the start of each meeting, and will direct the individual material processes of each student. Students are encouraged to explore their own experiences, interests, and various disciplines in relation to themes discussed and introduced in this class, including personal narratives and histories, site-specificity, loss of memory, and the passage of time etc. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; In-class workshops will introduce students to various on-campus tools and resources, including those available in Co-Works and in the Glass department. These demonstrations are expected to provide students with examples and basic techniques in which memory can be explored and presented. This may include the use of digital fabrication tools, such as 3D modeling and printing of objects and space, as well as analog techniques of mold-making, casting and photography to present alternative ways of documenting and recording memory. Workshops will increase in specificity as student needs and interest begin to develop throughout the term. Students will also be expected to share their own expertise and discipline-specific skills with others.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LANGUAGE IN THE STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Everything points to the conclusion that the phrase 'the language of art' is more than a loose metaphor" This course is a studio that aims to examine language and its manifestations in art and art practices. Through studio work, reading, discussions, lectures on historic precedents and relevant contemporary art practices, this class will introduce themes such as the question, "Is Art a Language?"  and Translation in language, in art, and in material. The class will investigate language as a process and as a material, as well as the language of material through demonstrations focusing on casting and hot glass, materials of multiple states of being that lend themselves to amorphous meaning. These topics will be further investigated through writing, both analytical and generative, and through studio assignments, discussions, and critiques.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' and designers' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENCOUNTERING THINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores the ways that objects and bodies come into contact with one another, asking how objects adorn, articulate, equip, augment, and constitute the person. In weekly readings and discussion, the class pairs theoretical, historical and critical theory perspectives that investigate subject-object relations. We begin by exploring the materiality and constitution of objects, examining how something is understood to be a commodity, waste, artifact, gift or magical thing. We examine the role objects play in the self-knowledge of persons (e.g. the use of objects to articulate social difference; the use of objects to materialize memory) and turn towards an examination of their role in mediating actions (e.g. the way objects discipline or constrain bodies; the ways they extend human capabilities).During a semester-long research project, students are invited to consider some important question related to their own studio and/or thesis work. We will talk about all stages of the research and writing process throughout the semester and with research librarians at the RISD library. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ORIGIN POINT: GRADUATE THESIS IDEATION WORKSHOPS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The purpose of this seminar is to unearth a direction - an origin point - for your graduate thesis and to jump-start the writing process for the Master's written document. Organized as a series of writing intensive workshops, this forum will enable you to explore relevant ideas, themes, core values, and to conduct research in support of the inquiry process. The process involves seeking out and scrutinizing various angles of your perspective as an artist / designer. You will write from these angles to discover the emerging aspects of solutions that matter. Each class will suggest a specific theme or principle of inflection to precipitate what is needed for the work's progress. Included will be several forms of writing: profile, review, narrative essay, poem, report, extended caption, as well as several levels of research: archival, bibliographic, fieldwork, and interview. Emphasis will also be on maps of meaning that will be used as a way to further processes of ideation and understanding. At the conclusion of the seminar you will have a conceptual focus for your thesis that is clearly formulated visually and verbally. With this is place, the summer months can then be used productively to further the breadth and depth of this initial idea through open-ended exploration and self-generated work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;BR&gt; Open to first-year graduate students only. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS' WRITINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will explore the various ways artists from the post-World War II onward have written about their work. By examining statements, journals, notebooks, interviews, diaries, poems, manifestos, essays, critical texts, and tweets by a variety of artists spanning Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman and Helen Frankenthaler through to Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Eva Hesse, as well as recent figures such as Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker, Fred Wilson, the Critical Art Ensemble and Julie Mehretu, the differing genres that artists' have used to describe their work will begin to emerge. Specific consideration will be given to the ways in which these literary forms structure the content and meanings of each artists' work. The course is constructed around in-class discussion of assigned texts, film and television interviews of artists, PowerPoint presentations, and visits to each student's studio. This seminar aims to extend the range of texts currently read by students, additionally serving as a springboard for the development of the graduate thesis within many of these literary strategies are pursued.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVESTIGATIONS: BETWIXT &amp; BETWEEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The unknown gap of the 'betwixt and between' is a space of great curiosity and charge.  It is a space that has captured the imagination of many artists, designers and writers throughout time. The main interest in this course is to investigate the nature of this space, how it is experienced, understood and given meaning from multiple viewpoints in art, design and literature, and ways in which it can become a space of significance for our practice as artists and designers.  As background to our own research, we examine features of the betwixt and between as it is evoked in the writings of the pre-Socratic thinkers, the theories of anthropologist Victor Turner, the lectures of composer John Cage, William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin's book titled The Third Mind, and philosopher Gaston Bachelard's view of spatial poetics.  Artists also walk us to that space, as is the case with Eva Hesse's threshold Works on Paper, Anselm Kiefer's preoccupation with ambivalence, and Anish Kapoor's sublime voids.  Most important, we will make and write as a way to see and understand the various forms and ways the betwixt and between presents itself in our own work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This graduate-level course investigates critical issues within contemporary art through the lens of curatorial practice. It examines the practical, conceptual, discursive, and social processes of curating across a variety of platforms. The course is designed to explore the many roles of the artist in society and concurrently, contemporary thought within the visual arts through a history of and hands-on approach to exhibition-making. Meetings will consist of lectures, readings and writing assignments, off-site visits, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits. Special emphasis will be placed on current trends and shifts in artistic and curatorial production, theory, and criticism. Students will examine case studies of a range of curatorial practices (from alternative art spaces to private collections to museums) and work collaboratively to conceptualize, research and develop curatorial projects that will result in a group organized exhibition.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Designing participatory exhibition spaces requires a deep understanding of social and time-based interactions between recipients and immersive environments.  In this course we will gain knowledge of the history of exhibiting and participatory approaches in galleries, museums, and public space. We will discuss the differences and similarities of participatory art and participatory exhibition design. We will explore models of communication to shape the interactions between artist, art work, recipient, and exhibition space. As designers, we will play with gaps in the communication process to allow undefined exchange and play to happen. We will explore the relevance of movement and time referring to performance art and contact improvisation. Finally, we will test out digital possibilities and old-school analogue hands-on media to immerse into multi-sensory exhibition experiences. Different examples of current participatory exhibition practices show tools and ways to engage the audience in multiple ways. The outcome of this course will be your own participatory exhibitions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will consider the various ways in which artists from Marcel Duchamp and Joseph Cornell through Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Louise Lawler, Fred Wilson, Mark Dion, the Atlas Group, and Arlene Shechet have engaged aspects of the museum a subject matter of their work.  Either engaged in a critique of museum practices or romantic evocations of the past, manifold artists from the early twentieth century onward have addressed issues such as the staging devices that museums utilize to confer aura on works of art and natural history specimens or the makeup of their collections, classification systems, and behind the scenes storerooms and archives.   This interest will be linked to an ever expanding body of writing that has emerged in the past four decades given to the various historical narratives that museums and their archives project on their holdings.  Writers such as Sigmund Freud, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, Donna Haraway, Ralph Rugoff, and Susan Stewart will be considered among others.  The seminar will explore the tie-ins between these theoretical texts and artistic approaches with the outcome that students will gain a distinct understanding of this rich history and the variety of ongoing responses to the museum. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What Next? (Making a) Living as an Artist&lt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  For this Professional Practices course, we explore the practical possibilities for your life after art school. Emphasis is on balancing your artistic practice with the financial demands of everyday life, on integrating your career path(s) with your artistic values and integrity, on developing realistic goals and strategies, and on finding "branching paths" that open new prospects.&lt;BR&gt;   Various avenues are explored, such as: exhibiting in galleries and museums, starting a business, working on commission, art writing, social practice, and forming a collective, a publication, or an independent gallery. Current financial, practical, and ethical ramifications of each of these avenues are considered. We discuss what matters when deciding where, geographically, to begin your career. &lt;BR&gt;   The course provides a number of skills: creating proposals, presentations, artists' statements, and resumes; and obtaining grants, residencies, commissions, art-related employment, studio space, and representation. Also touched upon are art law, copyright, budgeting, and taxes for artists. &lt;BR&gt;   There are guest speakers from galleries, public art agencies, design businesses, and a trip to New York City. We meet RISD graduate alumni who are currently developing their careers as artists and designers, and hear about their paths from graduation to living as artists. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;BR&gt; Open to undergraduate seniors&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of "humanitarian help" across the world. Yet as form-givers, they not only make physical objects, but also shape our understanding of the problem at hand. This power to represent demands that they should not only be technically proficient, but also be able to think about the ethics of intervention. Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions or aesthetic coverings, leaving larger political and ideologic discussions for other disciplines? Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself? This course asks these hard questions and unpacks them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study. This is not a "how-to" course. We will approach ethics as a reflective friction in our work and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use. Course material includes mind-opening historical studies, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Landscape architects and designers in other disciplines are taking an increasingly important role in addressing complex questions related to climate change and natural hazards.  These questions involve intersecting cultural and scientific issues.  This course is designed to equip landscape architects and other designers with an essential foundation in physical and social scientific aspects of climate change so that they may better engage with these questions.  Although it is impossible to cover the breadth of necessary topics and issues in a single semester, students will learn to analyze and access the scientific literature so that they can individually extend their education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emphasis will also be placed on essential skills and disciplinary approaches to enable more effective collaboration in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts.  This includes addressing cultural and disciplinary differences in approaches to scientific concepts such as validity and uncertainty, and examining epistemological aspects of science.  This course is an essential primer in climate change and natural hazards for any student who hopes to address these issues in their work or to work in policy based contexts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;br&gt; Open to graduate students only.  &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

Weekly topics, discussions and assignments will include a broad range of social issues from mass incarceration, prejudice, homelessness, and discrimination against disabled groups. &lt;br&gt; With the participation of artist, educator, and human rights activist Gina Belafonte, local community leaders, and businesses, Art for Social Change will prepare students for framing and producing powerful works that incorporate personal expressions towards global change. &lt;br&gt;Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TORPEDO LAB</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Torpedo Lab is an off-campus Case Study/Think Tank located in an eclectic 1929 Garrison Revival house in Hamden, CT which is also the residence of designer Murray Moss. The class will examine and discuss iconic examples of work from various artistic disciplines which are recognized because they have provoked change in existing paradigms. Juxtapositions of cross-disciplinary works from Moss's private collection will be created throughout the house to be used as tools to uncover and illuminate content in seemingly disparate works of art. There will be discussion around what the Beholder brings to a work of art (e.g. the artist as co-creator) and student ought to be prepared for experimentation, critical thinking, and immersive discussions.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This one-credit workshop meets on 2/15 (kick-off meeting), 3/1, 3/15, 4/5, 4/19, 5/3. Except for the kick-off meeting and the last two meetings (4/19, 5/3), which will take place at RISD, all other meetings will take place at Moss's Hamden, CT home. Transportation will be arranged by RISD.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Please see below for further details: &lt;BR&gt; 2/15 KICK-OFF meeting, PROV WASH 409, 1-2 pm) &lt;BR&gt; 3/1 Hamden 11:30 am - 6:30 pm &lt;BR&gt; 3/15 Hamden 11:30 am - 6:30 pm &lt;BR&gt; 4/5 Hamden 11:30 am - 6:30 pm &lt;BR&gt; 4/19 RISD 1-5 pm (location TBA) &lt;BR&gt; 5/3 RISD 1-5 pm (location TBA)  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; For the Hamden-hosted classes, there will be 90 minutes of travel before and after the course's contact time of 1:00-5:00pm.

   <COURSETITLE>X,Y, AND Z</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will involve a range of collaborative exercises, inquiries, experiments, lectures, readings, screenings, site visits, and projects, exploring graphic design as an inherently multidimensional and spatial discipline. 3D, not 2D. Graphic design as object, as projection, as display, as gauge, as structure, as installation, as sound, as architecture. Not just the X and Y, but also the Z axis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The course's subtitle is "Graphic Design in Space," a literal example being Carl Sagan's "Pioneer Plaque," the sum of humankind and space travel etched in pictographic form onto a pair of 9 ~ 6 inch aluminium plaques attached to NASA's Pioneer 10 probe on its 1972 mission to planet Jupiter. We will also investigate more terrestrial, yet equally literal, types of space and how they relate to the human body: pages, screens, rooms, buildings, and cities.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; A wide range of periods, fields, and figures will be surveyed: from the likes of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albrecht Du?rer, to Le Corbusier, Charles and Ray Eames, and Fiona Banner. Ultimately, we'll consider graphic design not only as orthographic (an anthropomorphic system that operates in multiple dimensions), but also as orthography (interpreting and communicating these spaces through signs and symbols). &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.&lt;br&gt; Open to senior and above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY III</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Typography III is the culmination of RISD's typography sequence, with an emphasis on typography and contemporary display platforms. Advances in software and hardware have created new opportunities for how language is written, sequenced and accessed. Projects in this semester depend on altered states, where the content, composition, and context all are potentially at play. Students will continue to develop proficiency in designing for static compositions while extending the meaning and voice of that work across multiple platforms. Students will have ample opportunity to further shape their perspective and individual voice in relation to contemporary typography.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways.

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY III</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Typography III is the culmination of RISD's typography sequence, with an emphasis on typography and contemporary display platforms. Advances in software and hardware have created new opportunities for how language is written, sequenced and accessed. Projects in this semester depend on altered states, where the content, composition, and context all are potentially at play. Students will continue to develop proficiency in designing for static compositions while extending the meaning and voice of that work across multiple platforms. Students will have ample opportunity to further shape their perspective and individual voice in relation to contemporary typography.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Chronological survey of graphic design through slide lectures. The course will study how graphic design responded to (and  affected) international, social, political, and technological developments since 1450.  Emphasis will be on printed work from 1880 to 1970 and the relationship of that work to other visual arts and design disciplines.  In addition to the lectures, the course will schedule a studio section in which design projects are integrated with research. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio course, as groundwork for the graduate thesis, will emphasize inquiry as a primary means for learning. Through making, reflection, collaboration, and critique, we will explore the underlying principles that design objects require, and synthesize theory and practice as necessary partners in graphic design. We will look at the designer's role in the process of revealing and making meaning - as an objective mediator, and as an author/producer, integrating content and form across projects as visual expressions of the preliminary thesis investigation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement for first and second-year majors; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING WITH COLOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course offers students the opportunity to design with color in a variety of media, while researching and studying color in use (in existing works of art, design, film, and architecture). Students are offered several projects to choose from. Each is designed to bring awareness about the role color plays in different areas, through analysis and interpretation of how color works in terms of optics, communication, metaphor, and visual stimuli. Topics considered include observing color in film, color as narrative device, color and light, color in fine art applications, and color in communication design. Students will also explore the similarities and differences of color palettes as used by artists and designers, and through the creation of several design projects, students will develop a sense of confidence and appropriateness when working with color.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Film and graphic design share an omnivorousness that devours all other media, and achieving mastery in either can fill a lifetime. Not coincidentally, similar questions are central to both forms: the careful deployment and control of image, color, text, tone, pacing, editing, communication, history, taste. the list of overlaps is long. &lt;BR&gt; Through a series of small exercises and short readings, culminating in a self-initiated multi-week project, this class seeks to offer a route into exploratory filmmaking that builds on the training and knowledge of a graphic designer. Skills will be learned through demonstrations and collaborative problem solving. The presumption is that projects will be executed in a film format, but this is not a requirement. Emphasis will be on finding a way to address problem solving in an unfamiliar time-based medium in a way that works for you. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors. only &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Design is an ever-expanding field that demands students be accustomed to constant change and requires the development of confidence and core competencies for life-long practice. Students will learn to identify design opportunities and areas of inquiry within question-based units framed by the faculty team. &lt;BR&gt; Each unit will vary in length, and will begin with a particular question to kick-off the process. For each unit, students will move through research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping and will be asked to communicate their findings. Units will increase in complexity over the four semesters, and are sequenced to move from a guided process to more open, self-generated methodologies. Units will be inquiry-based, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes to open questions. &lt;BR&gt; By the end of the year, each student should be in tune with his or her own working methods and will have the ability to frame projects independently and with self determination. Inherent in the course format is a kind of elasticity and nimbleness that should allow for group projects, social &amp; cultural engagement, and formal investigations instigated through a variety of faculty-posed questions. &lt;BR&gt; Some examples of the questions (prompts) students receive might be: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?  or How can you prevent people from texting while driving? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; 3-year MFA Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERACTIVE TEXT: INTERACTIVE SOUND AND IMAGE EMPHASIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Presented as fine art practice, this course will introduce the student to narrative and non-narrative experimentation with language in digital space. &lt;BR&gt;  During the course students will be given a number of short term assignments which will serve as explorations of common themes. Students will also propose a longer term investigation, that will develop in the form of a semester long project. &lt;BR&gt; We will explore both analog and digital technologies to develop the concepts presented during the semester, utilizing Final Cut, After Effects, Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop, Ableton Live and/or other programs for the production of texts. The course will have an interactive sound and image emphasis. Students will experiment with interactive text, visuals, and audio composition in the digital realm, placing emphasis on the effect and meaning transformation that occurs when texts are combined with visuals and audio material. &lt;BR&gt; The course will balance conceptual concerns related to content and structuring methodologies with artistic expression. Specific Aesthetic histories will be explored tracing the use of text in artistic practice including Concrete Poetry, the texts of Kurt Schwitters, Russian Constructivist posters, Fluxus poetic works, the Dada and Surrealist Word/Image, Magritte, Jenny Holtzer, Ed Ruscha, Barbara Kruger as well as other contemporary practitioners. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN (XD)</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As technologies advance, the integration of the physical and digital becomes more common. Screens are integrated into space, objects gain intelligence, places respond to us, and Experiential Design (XD) offers a design approach to the development of new ways to use these opportunities as platforms and tools. XD is the practice of creating interactive spaces which orient, inform, educate, or delight an audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course is designed for participants schooled in graphic design and attentive to contemporary technologies. Building upon that knowledge, this course will prime students to design and orchestrate spatially located interventions. Workshopping will provide hands on experience in rapid prototyping; resulting skills will then be applied in independent projects. Project prompts will allow for a range of subject matter. Scale of projects will range from hand-held to inhabitable, favoring human scale. Project content will range from complete narratives to crowd authored content. Project completion will range from prototypes to proposals, from full scale segment install to final installations. Course content will include exposure to a range of technologies while assignments will be medium agnostic. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $240.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE &amp; IMAGE IN MOTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We stand firmly planted in a visual world, surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors and more-as large as towering billboards and as small as compact cell phones. Such images provide us with clues about our environment, feeding our mind with information that we find useful for survival or for orientation purposes. But these very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us from discerning what is truly important. How do we tell them apart? The primary goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to create meaningful and intelligent images. Course content is tailored for three levels of experience - introductory, intermediate and advanced. Some of the class projects include documentary photography, film title design and music video. The works of Saul Bass, Bill Viola and Michel Gondry will be used as the "textbooks" for this course. Readings, film screenings and listening exercises accompany studio work. Some knowledge of Adobe Flash or After Effects or Final Cut Pro would be helpful but is not required.

   <COURSETITLE>WKSHP:DIGITAL PRINTING TECHNOLOGIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This workshop provides students with an introduction to the use of digital fabrication tools and an overview of their applications in both art and design. The course also functions as a gateway to Co-Works. Through technical demos and class projects, students are trained in the proper use of both the laser cutter and UV printer. The course explores the theoretical implications of this technology and situates it within the context of contemporary art and design practices. Through slide presentations, readings, and class discussions, students are encouraged to think critically about the role of digital tools in contemporary art and design and in their own practices. Students develop hybrid approaches; incorporating both "traditional" and "new" processes. Class projects encourage experimentation, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration as well as provide opportunities for individual exploration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective, Graphic Design majors only. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPUTER UTOPIAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The goal of this studio is to reimagine the personal computer. &lt;BR&gt;  Three decades ago, the Macintosh dropped a sci-fi bomb on pop culture. It advertised a utopic vision of human-computer creativity to mass audiences. By remixing military-industrial-academic fragments, a product company sold the dream of new humanism. This decade, the planet is bursting with smartphones; billions of people will carry globally-networked pocket computers, each outfitted with sensors that datify the material world. We now have quantities, rates, and kinds of data unlike anything humankind has ever seen. Individual biological minds can't reason at network scale, so we're teaching fields of computers to do it instead.  &lt;BR&gt; If the data center is today's mainframe, is there a Macintosh hiding in the next decade? If your phone's camera is the next mouse, what will it click on? As machine learning reinvents humanism, what are 21st century creative tools? What do network literacy and 21st century citizenship look like? Is the programmer/user dichotomy destroyable? How much of this is just a design problem? &lt;BR&gt; We'll explore these topics with studio work and seminar-style discussion. Studio work will include creation of mockups, videos, webmedia, interaction design, and beyond. Prototypes and design fictions are welcome. Programming experience is not explicitly required. Sincere eagerness to rigorously engage and reorient computer culture is a must. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic design majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 2</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the possibilities of design online from a conceptual, historical, and programmatic perspective. The class celebrates the Internet as a space for social exchange and independent expression, while questioning the cultural contradictions embedded in online discourse and the motivations of individuals and entities behind online platforms. Through projects, readings, workshops, and presentations we will explore the relevance of network technologies in the context of contemporary art and design practices. Students will learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with methods for conceptualizing, designing, and developing websites. Outcomes won't necessary be practical, nor pragmatically functional. Instead we will strive for a poetic understanding of design and the Internet as mediums for critical research and action. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course is based on the premise that the narrative shaping of information is fundamental to human communication. As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING INFORMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This graduate-only Visiting Designers course provides contact with the visiting designers in four intensive workshops over the 12-week semester. The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-majors pending seat availability. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NEWLY FORMED</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on advanced composition in Graphic Design and Typography using an array of materials, techniques and formats. Form remains an area of study in graphic design that does not need an application, only a surface. Emphasis will be placed on experimental form-making/image-making using generative and iterative approaches. Form need not follow function. Studio assignments are supported by lectures showing contemporary graphic form, from historical to contemporary work, that are effective and evocative. This elective aims to build a collection of work that can be shared with the larger graphic design community. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;br&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE TYPOGRAPHY STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement for first-year graduate students in the three-year program; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This elective is an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the process of designing a typeface; to consider all the design decisions that are a part of this creative exercise, and to learn the finer points of bzier wrangling, serif and sans, spacing, kerning, and all the other details of execution which turn a roughly-formed idea into a more complete, rigorous and polished type design. This course will provide a fundamental understanding of how typefaces work in addition to accessing a new design tool that can find practical use.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course about design and motion, filtered through the lens of real-world, graphic design applications. From film titles to animated gifs, design installations to handheld applications, motion is an important consideration in 21st century graphic design. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course combines disciplines of graphic design, animation, storytelling and sound design. Through a series of in-studio and multi-week assignments, students will create animated projects that include real-world assignments as well as experimental exercises. Short weekly lectures will discuss historic and current works of influential Motion Designers, Animators and Directors. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Adobe After Effects will be the primary production tool for this class. Through the sequence of assignments, students will become fluent with the software.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This particular form of design is in its infancy, and part of our aim is to push its limits. How are they most effective? ... How might a motion poster be dangerous? Students produce 3 compelling motion posters as well as weekly motion poster "sketches" for low-stakes, playful experimentation.</COURSEDESC>

With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRACTICE OF INTERACTION DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Interaction designers are responsible for crafting the behavior and flow for complex interactive systems  and are concerned with how that behavior relates to form, content, and most importantly, the humans  for whom they are designing. While interaction design incorporates practices from fields such as industrial  design and graphic design, it's different in that its form can offer hundreds of states across many form  factors and as a medium it can/should change and react over time. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This class presents both a conceptual framework and practical methods so students learn a holistic  approach to interaction design that covers audience, content, framework and flow, user interface and  presentation layer, and iteration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; We will experiment with a range of tools to produce low-fidelity / analog flows and high-fidelity prototypes  using Sketch, InVision, and wireframing kits in order to test and refine design and examine how humans  will use our projects in their own contexts. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Assignments will include in-class exercises, individual and team-based projects, as well as getting out  of the classroom to audition our ideas with users. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In addition to the design, students take part framing our domain, interviewing with stakeholders and  users, analyzing feedback, and engaging in critical discussions about the strengths and weaknesses  of their own work and the work of others. No coding required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective;Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt;Open to senior and above.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Typography 1 is the first in a three-course sequence that introduces students to the fundamentals of typographic practice, both as a set of technical skills and as an expressive medium. This first semester of typography begins fully zoomed-in -- exploring how and why letterforms are formed. Students will work with various tools and materials to construct letters; with attention paid to meaning, voice and the line between language and abstract form.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second part of the semester concerns itself with setting type. Typesetting is the score for the reading experience. Typesetting conventions and nomenclature will be taught by zooming out from the letter, to the word, to the paragraph and to the page. Students will become comfortable with typographic color and texture in a finite static composition. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN IN THE POSTHUMAN AGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The current understanding of what constitutes design is straining at the margins of convention. The reach of design has moved beyond the materiality of objects, to biotechnological matter of chemicals and encoded genetic information, from physical space to code and data. Human beings now live lives that are immersed in design. The designer and their subject share a dialectical relationship, constantly shaping and reshaping each other. The role of the designer, thriving in the world of post-industrial and digital technologies, is thus broader today than ever before-from designing brands and creating personalities, to contriving and manipulating living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Post-postmodernism, pseudo-modernism, supermodernism, digimodernism, are only a few of the many terms trying to describe our current state. Today, we occupy the digital domain as thoroughly as we do physical space. Codes and algorithms have also become signifiers of a new biotechnological paradigm shift, marking the passage into a posthuman epoch by launching us into a virtual space composed of a bright galaxy of screens and digital worlds, creating a symbiotic relationship between our technology and biological selves. As designers, we shape, clash, align, and distort this new space, elaborating a stage for the New Man and the New Woman, and perhaps even the Nonhuman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this class, we will explore our contemporary condition through visual-research based projects around self-design, speculative design and design fiction. We will use graphic design as a medium to ask questions about ethical concerns emerging from advancements in science and technology. We will develop a new design vernacular incorporating ideas from revolutionary recent developments in genetics, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. We will employ machine vision: microscopy, neuroimaging and NASA archives to create new fictional worlds in concert with the life forms around and inside us. This engagement with the sciences will allow us as graphic designers to acquire some fundamental tools that probe fundamental human nature, and help us navigate the posthuman epoch that lies ahead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above. &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading.

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 2</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SETS OF POINTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Sol LeWitt's Wall Drawings were created from a set of simple guidelines, first executed in graphite, then in crayon, later in colored pencil and finally in chromatic inks, bright acrylic paint and other drawing/painting materials. Conditional Design is a manifesto and working method of design that focuses on the process over the end product, much like the Wall Drawings of LeWitt's. This form of mark making can be applied to both contemporary fine arts and design practices.   Throughout this five week course, students will collaborate with classmates to observe and participate in several conditional design activities. Each week, students will re-examine and re-evaluate conventional materials and digital tools that used for drawing. We will use the Conditional Design Workbook as a reference. The workbook provides extensive insights into the Conditional Design method and invites its readers to actively participate in various workshops and drawing activities.   These workshops will be accompanied alongside short writing exercises about their experiences, given the specific constraints of each task. Over the course of the semester each student will need to present two new conditional design constructions. A full two weeks will be given to develop each of these new scenarios. The final week of the semester we will participate in each others creations and document all processes. All students will need to compile and publish their work.</COURSEDESC>

Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading.

   <COURSEDESC>Digital user experiences are a part of our everyday lives, shaping our realities and taking us to new levels of productivity and connectedness.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this hands-on studio, students will explore how designers create digital services and products that are easy to use and solve real-world problems. In two initial projects, one independent and one group-based, students will develop interaction design skills such as research, concept development, interface sketching, interactive prototyping, and user testing. For the third and final project, students will choose to work independently or in groups to develop a digital service or product of their choosing. This project will culminate in the final presentation of a "looks-like" interactive prototype and a video that illustrates the intended user experience. By the end of the course, students will have the skills needed to bring web, mobile, and ubiquitous digital user experiences from concept to reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A critical component of all art and design practice is an awareness and understanding of paper types, finishes, textures, weights, printing compatibility, specifications, size, fiber selection, project appropriateness, and other qualities. In this course, students will research the science and technology of papermaking, addressing methods, equipment, and materials from antiquity to today.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The first part of the course includes an in-depth investigation of fibers (plant, half-stuff and recycled) used in the formation of paper. Additionally, students will create an individual paper archive combining their own handmade sheets with commercially available examples and sources. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; After an understanding of the nuances of various pulps and techniques, students will experiment with letterpress, digital printing, and other reproduction methods, building an awareness of what is possible.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second part of the course includes the design and fabrication of hybrid books in which paper, printing, and content are melded together to create innovative design solutions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors and Brown students with Instructor permission. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URGENCY LAB</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>One must continue to work for the possibility of a poetry of the future. Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; How do we address what's truly urgent today? Urgent for whom? Crisis conditions have infused every aspect of culture and society with doubt, but the role and efficacy of art and design as a means for change is still debated. We'll begin this studio course by defining what Urgency Lab is on our own terms, casting a wide view towards climate, gender, race, and oppression. Can artists and designers loosen hegemonic power? We'll engage with a range of voices for guidance and inspiration through weekly studio visits and readings, both within and outside art and design discourse, with a particular emphasis on queer methodologies and historically marginalized perspectives. We'll draw upon Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's concept of the undercommons as a way to imagine our own position within an institutional context, and as the course develops we'll build an "urgency platform"-a network of tools, references, modalities, and scenarios-to help us speculate, imagine, and articulate a more just futurity.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; What is urgent craft? The semester will be devoted to exploring how legacy art and design techniques might be subverted (altered, manipulated, destroyed) to produce new, non-normative forms. Urgency Lab will be a collaboratively designed space, so determining the studio's criteria, scope, and output as a group will itself be an experiment in collective, peer-to-peer making as an act of resistance. Working in public, radical acts of publishing, research-based exploration, rapid prototyping, non-traditional tools and platforms, and experimentation will be encouraged.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; #gender #race #power #bias #safety #privacy #privilege #climate change #algorithmic control #authority #violence #terror #trauma #human rights #migration #identity politics #geo-politics #postcolonial nationality #representation #protest #whistleblower #peer-2-peer #mixed reality #decentralization #decolonization #intersectionality #failure and refutation &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors, non-majors and Brown students with Instructor Permission. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The poster has been an archetypal graphic design format since the late 19th century when lithographic printing technology came of age and captured the imagination of artists, bringing their vision into Paris streets. This course will invite you to explore future possibilities and contexts for the poster-as paper and as screen-building on its singular capacity to transform ideas into iconic picture planes; and examining the dynamics of typography and image, both still and in motion. Prompts will progress from individual posters, to sequences, to site-specific installations that explore the potential for interactive discourse in public space. Studio assignments will be supported with presentations and readings about poster history and contemporary poster design.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors and Brown students with Instructor permission. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THAD I: GLOBAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a required course for all freshmen and transfer students to introduce them to global modern and contemporary art, architecture and design in the period between 1750 and the present. The course addresses modernism as a global project, presenting several case studies from across the world that unfold to show how multiple kinds of modernism developed in different times and distant places. By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates. There are no waivers for THAD-H101. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Attention transfers and upperclass students: Please register into one of the evening sections set aside for transfer and upperclass students if you have not completed this first-year graduation requirement. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator in the Liberal Arts Division office for assistance if needed. All other H101 sections are for freshmen. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Bronze Age saw the development of several advanced civilizations in the Mediterranean basin. Perhaps the best-known among these is the civilization of Pharaonic Egypt. This course will focus on the art and architecture of Egypt and their neighbors to the north: the Aegean civilizations known as Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean. While art historical study of these cultures will be emphasized, evidence for trade and other cultural interchange between them will also be discussed. The course will cover such topics as the Pyramids of Giza, the Tomb of Tutankhamun, and the Palace of Knossos.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the architectural traditions of the Indigenous cultures of North America, Mesoamerica, and South America in historic perspective.  Examinations will focus on the critical cultural and environmental circumstances which led to the development of distinctive architectural styles throughout the Americas.  Approached from an anthropological/archaeological perspective, specific topics of discussion will include the following: construction methods and material choices, spatial arrangements and use areas, the relationship between physical and social community structure, and architectural manifestation of cultural belief systems.  Emphasis will also be placed on manipulations of the landscape in response to social and climatic needs.  Architectural culture discussed in this course will range widely in scale, dispersal and geography - from the igloo of a small Inuit hunting party to the entire Mayan city of Chichen Itza, to the terrace and irrigation systems of the Inca.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Illumination, illustration, interpretation -- these are all terms that can apply to the images in medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. While this course seeks to introduce students generally to the history of manuscript painting from the 6th to the 16th centuries, special emphasis will be placed on how these images relate(d) to the texts they adorn. The course will be evaluated on the basis of in-class discussions, two presentations, one exam, and a final research paper that will include a creative component.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>UKIYO-E PRINTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN ART: THE NIGERIAN EXPERIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on contemporary art in and out of Africa, with specific reference to Nigeria. Our objective is to situate Contemporary Nigerian Art within the dialectics of modernism and postmodernism beginning first with the colonial implantation of the "modernist" trend in Africa. We examine the impact on the artistic vision and direction of the major artists in Africa, while highlighting the careers of their counterparts operating outside the continent within the postmodernist currents of Paris, New York, London, Berlin, etc.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Museum is a significant and changing institution during the 21st century.  This class will subject the institution to scholarly critique.  We will consider the types of museums, the organization of museums, the curating of exhibitions, the growing role of on-line components in museums and the various support areas in the museum (finance, membership, etc.).  Ethics in the museum and sensitivity to audiences will also be part of our study.  We will visit the RISD museum and other local Providence museums.  Students will write catalogue entries, exhibition reviews and short papers that analyze readings.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a stimulus to the imagination, method of investigation, or as a basic means of communication, drawing is a fundamental process of human thought.  This class will examine various kinds of drawings from the history of art and visual culture moving chronologically from the medieval to the post-modern. Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This seminar is recommended for THAD concentrators and students especially interested in drawing. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

Through close study of houses, interiors, furnishings, and a range of texts, this seminar will explore multiple concepts of domesticity and ways these have informed design practice. Classes will be conducted as collaborative workshops focusing on discussion of assigned texts and analysis of images. Student research projects will investigate a contemporary work of design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This class examines the material culture of late consumer capitalism, focusing on how objects organize experience in everyday life. We will investigate the practices through which things-from food and clothing to smart phones-become meaningful, as we tackle political and ethical questions related to the design, manufacture, use and disposal of material goods. The class will introduce students to a range of scholarship on material culture from several disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, history, sociology, art and architectural history, and cultural studies. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>An overview of modern design, tracing major developments in interiors, furniture, and product design, from the turn of the 20th century to the present, in Europe and the United States. Artifacts range from chairs to computers to cars, from singular, hand-crafted objects to mass-produced consumer goods, from avant-garde to popular. Course discussions will deal with the formal and material character of objects, as well as cultural issues such as the ethics of labor, ideologies of gender, the relationship between nature and technology, and the mediating role of institutions and publications. Emphasis will be given to utilizing original sources, including primary texts, rare books in the Fleet Library special collections, and objects at the RISD Museum.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY AND MILITARISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography became especially popular as a vernacular and political medium around the time of the Crimean War in the nineteenth century. Since then, photography has been a critical medium that represents, commemorates, propagates, opposes, and complicates war and militarism across the globe. Histories of photography in the twentieth and twenty-first century have also unfolded through colonization, genocide, war, liberation, globalization, and war on terror. Militarism has thus been crucial to the medium's history: photography does not merely re-present the militarized life-in-the-making; it is an integral part of it. This course examines the ways in which the subject of photography has emerged through not only war but also what we will call "everyday militarism." Organized thematically according to photographic subjects, this course will closely investigate selected bodies of photographic work with readings on war, atrocities, subjectivity, ethics, and iconicity. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FORMS, WORDS, AFFECTS: THEORIES AND METHODS OF ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class examines different methods of interpretation employed by art historians and art critics to "read" works of art. Each week we will focus on a particular methodological approach central to the production of art historical knowledge such as Formalism, Iconography, Psychoanalysis, Semiotics, Post-Structuralism, Museum Studies, Critical Theory, Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Affect Theory, and Postcolonial Theory. The course also looks into the history of the discipline itself by way of reading primary texts written by art historians and thinkers whose thoughts and writings, in one way or another, have shaped the discipline of art history. We will also consider responses from non-Western scholars to the predominantly Western narratives that are at the center of the field.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores major movements and practices of photography in Asia from the nineteenth century to present day. Students will be introduced to a wide range of discourses on photography and will examine special topics in Asian photography each week: topics range from the diverse ways in which photography has entailed modernity to geopolitical implications in contemporary art photography in Asia. The course will investigate photography not just as documents of historical shifts but as objects, archives, and artworks in each cultural milieu. Students are expected to actively engage in class discussions. As a term project, students will write a research paper and give a short presentation on their research.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY ART OF LATIN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course serves as an introduction to modern and contemporary art of Latin America from c. 1900 to the present day. Beginning with the international formulation of modernismos and the institutionalization of muralism in Mexico, we will trace the development of various, contested "modernisms" throughout the Americas. Rather than adhering to a strictly linear chronology, we will approach this vast region and its histories through a constellation of themes that, together, will illuminate the uneven development of modernism across the hemisphere. We will address questions relating to the nature of national and international identity, as well considering the porous relation between Latin American modernisms and their European and U.S. counterparts. Just what is "Latin American" art? Is it defined by geography, by nationality, or in some other way? And does it fit into the received canon of "Western" art history?  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BORDERLANDS: LATINX ART AND VISUAL CULTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on representations by, of, and for Latinx peoples in the United States, beginning with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, which ended the Mexican-American War and ceded one-third of Mexican territory to the United States, until the present day. Drawing from Glora Anzalda's theory of the "borderland" as a both physical and psychological "in-between space," we will address questions of identity and belonging, assimilation and resistance, and visibility and erasure as they are encountered and debated by (and about) diasporic communities in the United States. Topics of discussion will include nineteenth-century debates of Pan-Americanism, the popularization and critique of Hollywood stereotypes during the Good Neighbor era, and Chicanx activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Issues of racial and ethnic identity will be considered alongside and in dialogue with those of gender, sexuality, class, and immigration status, and our discussions will encompass not only visual art but also music, cinema, literature, and activism. We will ask ourselves, what is the relationship of Latinx art and visual culture to that of the U.S.? What is its relationship to "Latin American" history and identity? And how might we begin to expand our definitions of U.S. art history?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ART OF RITUAL; EUROPEAN WORKS (1400-1800) IN PROVIDENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores objects and images used in rituals in pre-industrial Europe (ca. 1400-1800). A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that has its own temporal and spatial specificity. It occurs for staging religious practices, marriage, death, a ruler's visit to a city, or for creating responses in times of crises (epidemics, natural calamities, war, etc). Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society  but they are also ridden with conflict. Rituals work through the display of statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, ceremonial props, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. We will see how such objects and images gained power and what their mobility (in processions, for example) entailed.  We will study extant works as visual evidence for ephemeral events as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will help us to be critical about visual "representations" and evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in "re-presentations."&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

It is organized around major geographic regions (Eastern, Central, and Western Islamic lands) as well as themes that link the arts of the Islamic world together including the divine words of the Qur'an, royal patronage, geometric and vegetative motifs, religious and secular identities, cross-cultural exchange, figural representation, aniconism, etc. We will focus primarily on architecture, the art of the object, including ceramics, glass, metalwork, wood, ivory, jewelry, and textiles, and the art of the book, i.e., illuminated and illustrated manuscripts and calligraphy. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO IRANIAN CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"From international film festivals to university campuses, from museums of modern art to neighborhood theaters, Iranian cinema has now emerged as the staple of a cultural currency that defies the logic of nativism and challenges the problems of globalization." Hamid Dabashi writes this in the introduction to his landmark study of Iranian cinema, Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present and Future (Verso, 2001). This course introduces you to the history of Iranian cinema, from the Iranian New Wave (1960s) to the present. It examines the ways in it occupies an important place on the scene of global cinema while it "defies the logic of nativism." We will watch some of the most prominent movies by acclaimed Iranian filmmakers Dariush Mehrjui, Ebrahim Golestan, Nasser Taghvai, Amir Naderi, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Forough Farrokhzad, Jafar Panahi, Masoud Kimiai, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Bahram Beyzaie, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, Marzieh Meshkini, Asghar Farhadi, Tahmineh Milani, Ebrahim Hatamikia, and Kamran Shirdel. We will also look at the works of diasporic artists, including Shirin Neshat, Marjane Satrapi, Ramin Bahrani, Mitra Farahani, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Granaz Moussavi. &lt;br&gt; There is a separate evening film screening from 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM each Thursday.

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POWER, DEPENDENCE AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN EARLY MODERN VISUAL CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the visual culture of social welfare and justice during the early modern era (1500-1900). A powerful guild of silk manufacturers sponsored the construction of the first large-scale orphanage for abandoned children in Renaissance Florence, employing architects, painters, woodworkers and sculptors. "Talking statues" in Rome advocated for the end of oppressive taxation by over-zealous popes.  Printmakers across Europe turned out satirical woodcuts and engravings that graphically argued for better living conditions and labor laws in the age of industrialization.  Josiah Wedgewood issued a plaque that poignantly pleaded for the abolishment of slavery.  Here, we study a broad range of imagery, objects and architecture that forged a language of social justice that still exists today.  Drawing on the rich collections of the RISD Museum, Fleet Library Special Collections and the John Hay Library at Brown, among others, we examine the role of patrons, artists and designers in advocating for, and advancing, social welfare in an increasingly urban and educated society.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCOCO ROCKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A key moment and place in the history of design, eighteenth-century art was innovative and rich in criticism, especially in France. Favored themes in the graphic arts and sculpture include gallantry (fetes galantes), eroticism, and domesticity. French art dealers were responsible for new designs for furniture and decorative arts; architects developed utopian projects; and seamstresses launched extravagant fashion trends. We will examine how rococo came to be the dominant artistic trend in all Europe and the kinds of controversy that it generated from the mid-century on. Rococo Rocks will provide analytical tools for understanding the visual arts within their social and critical contexts including the Enlightenment. We will navigate between genres and media, assess how works of art were then perceived, and discuss the position of women (whether mothers, wives, or artists). We will also study the ramifications of rococos continuing curve into twentieth-century art from Art Nouveau to Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons.&lt;BR&gt;   Visits to several departments of the RISD Museum are planned as well as to the Hay Library where we will study original eighteenth-century illustrations. Students final projects consist in designing a rococo-inspired object in any medium (painting, sculpture, textile, print, or drawing) accompanied by an artists statement.</COURSEDESC>

General themes will be perspective, form, color, and mechanical devices, and will include discussions on intellectual training, notebooks, treatises, and collecting. The course will examine artists such as Masaccio, Leonardo, Piero della Francesca, D|rer, Serlio, Carlo Urbino, Cigoli, Rubens, Vel`zquez, Saenredam, Vermeer, Poussin, Andrea Pozzo, Canaletto, Phillip Otto Runge,Turner, Delacroix, Monet, and Seurat. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMMES FATALES &amp; DOMESTIC NUNS: IMAGES OF WOMEN IN 19th and 20th CENTURY WESTERN ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMERICAN PRINTS: ARTISTS AND MASTER PRINTERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The 1960s saw the expansion of the art market in the US when printmaking workshops emerged on the coasts and in the heartland. Artists and master printers worked collaboratively at ULAE, Tamarind, Gemini GEL, Tyler Graphics and others, and such presses also editioned artists' prints for sale via the gallery system. Importantly such workshops also offered an opportunity to artists primarily committed to other media to explore various printmaking methods. Collaboration among artists and printmakers thus became a hallmark of the so-called American Printmaking Renaissance. The course will investigate the nature of collaboration between artists and master printers as we study prints by epoch-making artists including Louise Nevelson, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Helen Frankenthaler, Richard Diebenkorn, Ed Ruscha, Vija Celmins, as well as lesser-known artists who contributed significantly to the popularity of prints.Technical innovation continued in the era of Pop with the use of commercial techniques by Warhol, Rosenquist and Lichtenstein, and continues today with the use of digital media. We will draw upon the collection of the RISD museum to develop an intimate understanding of the role of innovation and collaboration in American printmaking ca. 1960-1990. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will read memoirs by artists, as well as essays by Barthes, Foucault, and Krauss.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEA, COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE? THE VISUAL AND MATERIAL CULTURE OF EXOTIC DRINKS IN PRE-INDUSTRIAL EUROPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We are so familiar with these three hot drinks but they became commodities and part of our everyday only recently. This course explores what values were attached to these plants before the era of industrialized production, i.e. before ca. 1800. We will survey how Westerners adopted these beverages by looking at medical theories, the issue of morality, and the expansion of sugar production. We will also study how the craving for these products reinforced or even spurred slavery in French, Dutch, and English colonies. Special attention is dedicated to how ritual behavior affects design in terms of the sociability around these beverages, required manners, and the tableware crafted for them. The methodology is based on the analysis of images, discussions of assigned readings, written responses, visits to museums (RISD and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), and touring the facility of a chocolate artisan.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: PRE-COLONIAL TO CONTEMPORARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This travel course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between HPSS and THAD; the THAD component addresses colonial, modern, and contemporary arts in several regions of Mexico, including Mexico City, where we will view murals by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo's house and museum, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and the world-renowned Museo de Antropologa; Puebla, known for its ceramics production and its ties to early colonial commerce, as well as nearby Cholula with its many colonial churches; Veracruz, a port city distinctive for its ties to the Caribbean and as a site of the importation of enslaved Africans; and Mrida, the most culturally active city in the Yucatn Peninsula, with access to several early and classic Maya archaeological sites, as well as a vibrant contemporary arts scene.  &lt;br&gt; The THAD portion of the course will cover the colonial, modern, and contemporary periods in terms of artistic, architectural, and visual production, considering how indigenous pre-colonial techniques and traditions (addressed in the HPSS portion of the course) are revived, reinvented, and synthesized with European, African, and Asian styles, materials, and practices.  &lt;br&gt; Prior to leaving for Mexico, the students will be given a illustrated lecture with an overview of Mexico's past cultural and political history, including the development of major civilizations throughout Mexico, the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th c., the Mexican revolution, and the current political structure of the country. During our travel, each site visit will be accompanied by a brief contextual introduction orienting the students to the site's contributions to Mexico's history and cultural context.  &lt;bR&gt; The course hopes to not only inform students about the culture and history of our neighbors to the South, but also give them knowledge and an appreciation for the many contributions that Mexican past civilizations and contemporary Mexican culture have provided globally, and continue to bring to us. We also hope that our traveling students will learn about group dynamics, develop sensitivity towards a culture that might be foreign to them, be willing to explore a host of new traditions, acquire new knowledge, and discard possible stereotypes and preconceptions about an American region to which so many of our US citizens and immigrants have a connection to.  &lt;br&gt; For the THAD portion of the course, students will be required to write two short papers (3 pages, double-spaced) that reflect upon the readings and/or the sites visited. They should be focused, organized responses that include a clear thesis (or guiding idea) rather than being a stream-of-conscious response, but may incorporate personal reflections, impressions, and opinions. The course will conclude with a focused, researched response (5-7 pages) that engages with some aspect of Mexican art, architecture, or visual culture, from the pre-colonial period to the present day. It may incorporate personal reflections and impressions, but it should reference and cite specific texts that we have read in the course, as well as artworks and/or sites we have visited during our trip. Papers will be due after our return from Mexico.  &lt;br&gt; Students' grades will take into account their participation and inquisitiveness in/about the various site visits, as well as their level of inquiry and critical engagement demonstrated in their written responses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for THAD-W135 and HPSS-W235. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration.

   <COURSEDESC>This is a travel course offered by the Liberal Arts Division with a cross-disciplinary collaboration between HPSS and THAD; the HPSS component addresses the pre-Columbian history of the architecture and the arts in several regions of Mexico, including Mexico City, where we will visit the Diego Rivera, Siquieros and Orozco murals, Frida Kahlo's house &amp; museum, Bellas Artes museum, the world reknown anthropology museum, and Xochimilco, the canals left from the early settlement of the Valley of Mexico by the Mixteca/Aztec civilization), Puebla (known for its ceramics production and its ties to early colonial commerce), nearby Cholula with its many colonial churches, Veracruz (culturally relevant as a port city where African slaves were bought to, as well as for its ties to other Caribbean regions), and Merida, the most culturally active city in the Yucatan peninsula, giving access to several early and Classic Maya archaeological sites. &lt;br&gt; This portion of the course will also address the contemporary cultural traditions that distinguish each region from each other in terms of crafts production, the use of local materials, and the identifying regional dress, language and cuisine modalities. &lt;br&gt; Prior to leaving for Mexico, the students will be given a illustrated lecture with an overview of Mexico's past cultural and political history, including the development of major civilizations throughout Mexico, the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th c., the Mexican revolution, and the current political structure of the country.

   <COURSETITLE>EHP ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course considers modern design cultures worldwide, focusing on networks of individuals and institutions that formed across national borders since the early twentieth century. A theme of the course will be the design theories and practices initiated at the German Bauhaus in the 1920s and their subsequent international spread and local adaptation, precipitated by war, exile, migration, globalization of industry and trade, and decolonization. Case studies may include Lazlo Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago, Anni Albers at Black Mountain College, the HfG Ulm and its collaboration with schools in Brazil and India, and the recently founded Bauhaus Institute at the China Academy of Art. Throughout, we will ask what happens when the idea of universal design is adapted to local politics, economies, and design cultures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will survey the emergence of an avant-garde in the United States during and after World War II.  The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM AND AFTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>No movement in the history of twentieth-century art is more synonymous with modernist abstraction than Abstract Expressionism. Its rise to prominence in the 1940s signaled not only a new era of American dominance in the international art world, but also a period of triumph for the project of formalist modernism. Yet in the decade that marked its immediate aftermath, an array of movements and practices arose both to challenge Abstract Expressionism's singular position in the postwar art world and to call into question the aesthetic paradigm that it embodied. In this course we will trace these developments, examining the major artists who defined Abstract Expressionism, the claims made on its behalf by the critics who theorized and debated it, the uses to which it was put in the context of Cold War politics, the fundamental questions it raised about aesthetic autonomy and expressive freedom, and the various challenges directed at it in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, most notably by Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptual Art. In so doing, we will attempt both to construct a broad historical account of Abstract Expressionism and to develop a critical understanding of how it helped set the stage for the dominant forms of contemporary art that would follow. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DEBATING IMPRESSIONISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While impressionism once inspired some of the most innovative thinking in art history, overexposure has blunted its edge. This seminar seeks to recover what impressionism meant to its time, and to ask what it could mean to ours. After a brief introduction to the major figures (Degas, Manet, Monet, Morisot, etc.), discussion will be organized around a series of debates in the history and reception of French impressionism. Was impressionism a loosely affiliated group of individuals or a coherent movement? Did it extend prior traditions or radically break with the past? Was it objective or subjective? Was it feminist or misogynistic? Was it anarchist, republican, or socialist - and why think about its politics at all? Students will learn strategies for making arguments about paintings, both as material things and as historical artifacts. Readings will focus on primary sources (Baudelaire, Mallarm, Zola, etc.), stressing how new movements in art influenced criticism - and visa versa. We will supplement these readings with select secondary sources of methodological interest, especially landmark texts in social, feminist, and technical art history. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the body as subject, object, medium, and lens. This class is intended as both a discussion of the shifting role of the human form as represented and implicated in artwork from nineteenth century to the present day, as well as an experiential interrogation of our own somatic experience as scholars, artists, and humans, in order to ask the question: what does the body have to teach us? We will address the discourses of the imaged and imagined body prior to and through European modernism as a carrier of meaning and an object to be consumed, with particular attention to the ramifications of the Cartesian mind-body distinction. From this starting point, we will track shifts and the development of alternate theories of the body from psychology, philosophy, critical theory, and neuroscience, from the nineteenth century into present day. In addition to theory and philosophy, we will address how these shifts are manifest in artwork of the twentieth century from painting, sculpture installation art, video, and augmented reality art. Students will be asked to be mindful of their own somatic (bodily) practices, including movement inside and outside class with the intention of developing a deeper understanding the body as lens for experience and production.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will trace major developments in contemporary art from the 1960s to the present. Beginning with the shift away from modernist abstraction in the late 1950s and proceeding chronologically, we will examine the diverse array of movements, practices, and events that have come to define the larger field of contemporary art: minimalism, conceptualism, and pop in the 1960s, site specific and performance art in the 1970s, the "culture wars" and postmodernist debates of the 1980s, and the various forms of "abject," project-based, and "relational" art that followed. Foregrounding problems that have remained central for artists throughout this period - the status of the body, the institutional conditions of artistic production and reception, the politics of representation and difference - we will focus on putting the shifting terrain of contemporary art into broad social, historical, and theoretical perspective. In turn, we will attempt to develop a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the aesthetic and political stakes of contemporary art today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course tracks the relationship between art and social, political, and aesthetic "revolutions, "predominantly in the Western context, through the twentieth century. As a starting point for our conversations on the conceptual and political revolutions reflected in and implicated by the artworld, we will examine the emergence of the avant-garde and its challenge to the Academy as it relates to shifting market forces, understandings of psychology, subjectivity, and the role of art in the public sphere. Exploring the significance of image-making to socio-political conditions in the first half of the century, we will look at movements including Russian Suprematism, French Surrealism, and Mexican Social-Realism. Moving into the latter half of the century we will examine the ways conversations about art and revolution became more abstract  -- though no less influenced by shifting socio-political conditions  -- exploring the emergence of postwar expressionism, conceptual, performance, and "relational aesthetics" as conceptual revolutions of understandings of art, object, and meaning.</COURSEDESC>

Readings will include selections from Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and take into account return stories such as the Odyssey.  Art with Trojan iconography will be explored from ancient vase-paintings and sculptures through Renaissance and Baroque depictions, up to a contemporary graphic novelization and a brief discussion of films on the subject.  Major themes include the interaction of art and literature, and the mutability of an established narrative at the hands of subsequent creators.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLABORATIVE DESIGN IN MOROCCO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores contemporary design as inspired by Moroccan artisanal crafts. Young and seasoned designers alike are poised to revolutionize the craft and design landscape in Morocco. Government and private initiatives are supporting the preservation of cultural heritage and the rise of crafts in the global marketplace. Moreover, in the realm of design theory, "craft" is experiencing a renaissance. This course will first explore contemporary craft-and-design in a broad sweep across the Middle East and other parts of the Global South. We will then take a more in-depth look at Morocco. After an overview of the colonial and post-colonial social and economic histories that have led to a revival of the crafts, we will study Morocco's diverse landscape of cultural products and styles. Selecting several case studies of contemporary designers inspired by and/or working with crafts and craftspeople in Morocco, we will discuss the ups and downs of their journeys through a complex network of traditional practices and expectations. Throughout the semester, we will draw upon visual and textual source material through in-class discussions and virtual conversations with Moroccan designers and craftspeople. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING GENIUS: OBJECTS, INTERIORS, AND THE POP CULTURAL MECCA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the myth and cultural importance placed on spaces and objects occupied and used by the so-called "geniuses" of American history alongside our general romantic interest in "the genius" as a cultural phenomenon. We will examine the designed objects and spaces of famous American artists and heroes - places such as Graceland, Dollywood, and Marfa; objects like Thomas Jefferson's writing desk; and museums created out of the homes of Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain, among others. In an attempt to unpack and understand the importance of objects in both memory- and identity-making, we will consider how visual and material objects both communicate personality and legacy and how they act as mediators between each "genius" and their audiences, allowing visitors to come into contact with the imaginative worlds of their heroes.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course examines 20th century American popular culture - both visual and material - in relation to American history in order to understand how it reinforces socio-political ideologies in everyday life. We will look at and learn to decode advertisements as key to the cultural meanings of objects and as propaganda in reinforcing and disseminating cultural values. Using pop culture objects/concepts such as Disney, Tupperware, Barbie dolls, cars, TV, and the "American Dream," we will explore democracy, capitalism, and questions of "high" and "low" cultural artifacts.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;Also offered as HPSS-C408; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course invites you into the debates within philosophical aesthetics as they have been waged over the nature of aesthetic experience and appreciation, pleasure, beauty, as they bear on questions of art, and appreciation of nature, and everyday objects. The course involves focused discussion and writing on the readings and engagement with particular works in various media, historical and contemporary. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This experimental course offers students the opportunity to seriously explore some topic or question in history, philosophy, or one of the social sciences, which has a bearing on their degree project. Students will be guided through the process of formulating a research project, identifying the relevant literature, critically reading that literature, and working out how the HPSS material (content and/or methodology) can deepen and enrich their studio practice. We'll look at some artists and designers who have made these sorts of connections and but spend most of the time in discussion of student work. Coursework will be tailored to the needs of individual participants. To obtain permission to register for the course, send an email to the instructor with the following information: your name, major, year in school (junior, senior, graduate student), and a description of (a) your studio degree project, as you currently conceive of it, and (b) the area, topic, or question in history, philosophy, or the social sciences that you want to explore. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will explore the interdisciplinary subjects of global environmental justice, environmental racism, and other environmental inequalities. The primary goal of this course is for students to comprehend the multiplicity of critical issues, debates, and responses within global and local environmental justice. We will discuss and analyze environmental justice as a movement that involves marginalized communities in diverse ways in a globalized world. Using case studies, this course will consider examples of toxic distribution and exposure, accidents and disasters, regulatory failures, barriers to political participation, and the commodification of land and labor. The course will identify contemporary responses to environmental inequalities including grassroots local and international advocacy, climate justice, food justice, indigenous rights, ecofeminism, and Julian Agyeman's concept of "just sustainabilities." The class will travel to a unique brownfields and envrionmental justice restoration site on a Native American reservation in the Hudson Valley.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CLIMATE FUTURES, TRANSITIONS AND THE GREEN NEW DEAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Climate Futures, Transitions and the Green New Deal is a course that starts from the proposition that the consensus position on the climate crisis, as summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, provides a robust scientific basis for thinking about the challenge of deep decarbonization and adaption to life on a warmer planet. The course provides a survey and evaluation of the social science of the post-carbon transition. The course is grounded in environmental sociology and critical design studies, but the social science of the post-carbon transition is necessarily inter- and cross-disciplinary. As such, students will be encouraged to draw from broader historical, scientific and policy literatures in energy policy and urban studies, climate science, political ecology, public policy,agro-food studies and beyond to grapple with the challenge of societal transition. We will critically interrogate the merits of green neoliberal, feminist, Green New Deal and post colonial/post-capitalist proposals for post-carbon futures. We will debate the future of manufacturing, technological innovation, employment, urbanization, and food cultivation in a carbon constrained world. The course will also consider how different visions of transition might contain and enact very different political and ethical assumptions, and open or foreclose very different power relations.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

With improved understanding of how the brain works comes new powers for understanding, monitoring, and manipulating human cognitive, emotional and behavioral functioning; such new powers have potentially profound implications for the law, social policy, clinical practice, and personal experience. Topics to be covered will include: moral judgment and decision making, freedom of the will, moral and legal responsibility, use of psychopharmacology for enhancement of mood and cognition, the neural basis of pro-social and anti-social behavior, neuroimaging and privacy, the use of neuroimaging data in courts of law (e.g., to assess truth-telling and the accuracy of memory), brain injury and brain death, the development of neurotechnologies, and the importance of ethical and social guidelines. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and junior students. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Technological change is often considered to be neutral, objective or merely to provide useful solutions to problems. However geographic perspectives on design explore the ways technologies are always situated in place, as well as linked to other places. We will investigate how geographic concepts such as place, scale, difference, representation, power and nature might inform the politics of design. We will examine the contributions human geography makes to understanding the ongoing and dramatic changes occurring in the collision of history, place, design, society and nature. There will be opportunities to reflect on the extent to which processes of technological change and design might be rendered more accountable, sustainable and reflexive. And in turn, to consider how all of this might impact your own understandings of art and design praxis.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: MATRIX OF WISDOM: PHILOSOPHY &amp; SCI-FI</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Philosophy, the quest for wisdom, seeks answers to life's deepest and most enduring questions.  How should we live?  What is the truth?  What is real? What and who are we in a universe of things unlike ourselves?  At its core, philosophy is a discursive, argumentative probing that pokes at our fundamental assumptions about the world.  The philosophical mind, of course, welcomes the challenge.  In addition to philosophers raising these questions, fiction has been a vehicle for raising these issues and challenging the status quo mindset of its readers.  Science fiction in particular, has long been occupied with questions regarding man's place in the universe and the limits and potentials of science.  While such philosophical probity rarely makes for great television viewing, there are a few shows, such as Star Trek, The X-Files and others, that are distinguished by their consistent philosophical texts in conjunction with the study and discussion of selected episodes from these extraordinary television series.  Participation, several short papers and group presentations are required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Greek historian Thucydides wrote that knowing the past is useful for understanding the present because, so long as human nature remains the same, things that happened once "will recur in similar or comparable ways." The Greeks of the 6th century BCE began a systematic, critical inquiry aimed at making sense of the world around us and within us. This "Greek Enlightenment" was as revolutionary and had as far-reaching consequences as the subsequent European Enlightenment. We will examine history's first tumultuous passage from religious myth to scientific theory and philosophical argument. Readings will be drawn from Hesiod, the philosophers before Socrates, Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, Greek poets, dramatists, and historians.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This introductory course provides a broad overview of the major content areas within the field of psychology (e.g., physiological, developmental, social and cognitive psychology) and will introduce you to the psychological theories and research used to understand human behavior. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including how people learn, process and store information, why people possess distinct personalities, how social situations and cultural norms affect our behavior, how we grow and develop throughout our lives, etc.  Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the merit of classic psychological theory and research in understanding people's thoughts, feelings and actions in real world situations. This course will provide a broad knowledge base for those interested in taking upper level psychology classes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the evolution of influential political concepts and theories from ancient cultures to the present day, by those writing in/from/to the West. Through textual analysis, students will explore the historical and contemporary understandings of key terms such as authority, legitimacy, liberty, republicanism, democracy, revolution and "the good." Through an application of political theory methods of analysis and critique, we will also address the manner and extent to which these ideas are relevant today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LEADERSHIP OF SOCIAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Reflecting on historical and contemporary models of leadership, this course is designed to engage an active dialogue with the ways that collective social problems are both enabled and addressed by leaders. It also examines individual leadership potential by exploring how personal affinities can be focused and developed into effective strategies for solving problems, advancing ideas, and making change. Finally, it considers ethics, especially looking at the ways leadership can solve human problems. While primarily focused on public issues, this course will consider leadership in all economic spheres, and will look at the ways artists and designers practice leadership. In addition to reading, classroom discussion, and writing assignments, students will complete a community-based project in Providence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GENDER IN EAST ASIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a seminar course on East Asian gender identity from ancient times to the present.  Employing the rubrics of Gender History and Cultural Studies, we will examine the ways in which Chinese, Japanese, and Korean conceptions of "masculine" and "feminine" have evolved in relation to a myriad of political and economic forces, as well as through the self-directed endeavors of people in this area to discover and express their "true" selves.  After first going over the conceptual and social underpinnings of traditional East Asian gender roles via close readings of representative primary sources, the remainder of the course will engage recent scholarship to uncover how these roles have developed in the modern and contemporary eras.  Particular emphasis will be placed on how national conceptions of gender identity are formed within a broader environment of transnational cultural consumption.  The course will conclude with student presentations on a self-selected research topic.        &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NCSS CORE SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and junior students. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Mathematicians are artists of the imagination. This course is an exploration of their abstract conceptual systems which have almost inadvertently yielded spectacularly successful real world results. It also looks at suggested artistic modes of thought and strategies of artistic exploration. Discussions will include imagination as a valid perception of the world (a sixth sense); high orders of infinity; abstraction, idealization and reality; the geometry of vision, other non-Euclidean geometries and the relation of these geometries to our universe.  Regular attendance, some assignments and outside reading are required.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN ECOLOGY: HOW WILDLIFE INTERACTS WITH URBANIZING LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE EAST IS RED: ASIAN SOCIALISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The most popular song in Maoist China was "The East is Red."  This wintersession provides an historical and political overview of socialism in Asia from the late 1910s to the present.  In addition to looking at the socialist governments of China, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, we will examine cases of "unsuccessful" socialist movements in Japan, Indonesia, Nepal, and India.  Class materials include memoirs of survival by non-state actors, the writings of socialist leaders, and cultural constructions such as revolutionary theatre, songs, and contemporary films.  We will also engage secondary scholarship that deals with Asian approaches to modernity, the use of revolutionary and state violence, and gender relations under socialism.  Questions that will be addressed include: Why did Marxism, a European theory, find such resonance in Asia?  Twenty-five years after the fall of communism, why have Asian socialist states remained in power?  And in the scales of history, how should we judge the effects of socialism in Asia?   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Socrates described philosophy as an intellectual preparation for death.  He recognized that how we react to, think about, and cope with finality tells us a great deal of what we think about the core of our existence.  Philosophers have been divided between a "bald scenario" that death is nothing but the end of our material existence to which we are limited, and the more reassuring view that death is a door to another personal plane of existence.  Death is nothing vs. death is everything.  We will examine these phenomena from philosophical points of view through reflection primarily on philosophical works but will include religious sources and literary works.  While philosophers have primarily focused understandably on the individual confronting death, we will constantly place these questions and their answers within interpersonal and social spheres of consideration.  We will focus on: What is Death? The role of death in the meaning of life; personal survival in various scenarios; ethical issues surrounding suicide, euthanasia, and other voluntary ending of life.  We will look at a few of the social practices surrounding death and examine their meaning and functionality. Intensive reading, writing, and participation in seminar format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Some films, and other creative expressions, reflect an inherent endorsement or criticism of the politics contemporary to them.  We will examine social critics' roles in some of the influential movements of the West in the 20th century--the Russian Revolution, German Nazism, the New Deal, World War Two, the Cold War and Third World Liberation movements.  Requirements include readings and screenings from each of the eras covered, written assignments and exams, and participation in class discussions.

   <COURSETITLE>PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Religion has long been a part of human life. Prehistoric burials include utensils and companions (sacrifice) for life in another world. Early writings pray for divine intercession or advise how to win divine favor.  Are beliefs such as these in survival after death and in supernatural beings reasonable?  Philosophy of religion asks this of these beliefs and others: Is belief based on experience (mysticism) and not argument reasonable?  Can the divine be proved to exist by argument, or proved not to exist (or care) by the prevalence of suffering?  Does the supernatural intervene in nature (miracles)? These and other questions will be examined through reading classic and contemporary writings, lectures, discussion, and student presentations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PSYCHOLOGY OF EVIL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evil has long been a topic of study for theologians and philosophers, but has only recently been studied by psychologists. Although evil is an inherently subjective topic, we will attempt to take an objective, scientific approach to understanding why people engage in evil behavior. Thus, we will begin by attempting to suspend the notion that we can divide the world into good and evil, and instead understand the situational and psychological factors that could lead anyone to harm others. Specifically, we will focus on classic psychological studies that show how everyday people can be led to act in deplorable ways by manipulating the situational circumstances. We will also discuss how inter-group processes can lead to conflict and large scale acts of violence like war and genocide. Finally, we will study the nature of the psychopathic personality in order to better understand those individuals who feel no guilt or remorse for harming others (e.g., brutal dictators and serial killers). This is a very interactive class and will require you to contribute in discussion and prepare an in-depth presentation on an area of your own interest related to the psychology of evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We will examine the art styles and technologies, as well as the architectural forms and implied social organization found in the archaeological record of ancient Peru.  Our goal will be to trace the history of cultural development, in this isolated setting, from the earliest hunter/gatherers to the complex civilization of the Incas.  This semester there will be special attention given to three media: architecture, ceramics, and textiles.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HAVC-C736.

   <COURSETITLE>GEOGRAPHIES OF SOCIAL DIFFERENCES AND JUSTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar provides an introduction to contemporary geographic thought about social difference and justice, with a focus on urban environments. Cities are often presented as sites of diversity, choice, and opportunities. But possibilities are not equally available to all. We will foreground geographic understandings of the intersections of social difference, power, nature and space. We will consider who benefits and who loses from particular socio-spatial arrangements; study how social and spatial difference shape one another (for example, through racial and ethnic segregation); and investigate grassroots struggles for justice and claims for a right to the city. The seminar offers students concepts and opportunities to see urban environments, and their place within them, in new ways.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRADITION AND CHANGES: MODERN EAST ASIA 1800 TO PRESENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This lecture course covers East Asian in the modern age.  Its focus is on the interdependent, yet culturally distinct, histories of China, Korea, and Japan.  Broadly speaking, the period from 1800 until the present has been marked by East Asia's steep decline and equally sharp rise.  We will trace the many twists and turns of this path, learning how the region struggled to survive foreign incursions and severe domestic rebellions, as well as bouts of ideological extremism and intense cultural critique, to emerge where it is today.  Questions that we will ask include: What constitutes "East Asia"?  What does it mean to be "modern"?  And what relationship should East Asian nations pursue with each other and with the rest of the world?  By the end of the course, students will possess a better understanding of East Asian history at both the elite and the popular level.  They will also have empathy for the viewpoints of people who sought to defend and improve their fortunes in tumultuous times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: THE SCIENCE OF ATTAINING A BETTER LIFE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the late 1990's and early 2000's research psychologists began the field of positive psychology to combat two trends: 1) a large and growing body of faux scientific self-help literature that was not based on empirical science, and 2) a historical legacy of the field of psychology almost exclusively focusing on the function and operation of negative emotions (fear, anxiety, depression, anger, etc.).  Positive psychology focuses squarely on positive emotions (e.g., happiness, gratitude, love, awe) as well as experiences like forgiveness, resilience, and flow that improve our psychological well-being. With a focus on human strengths and virtues, the difference between that which we think will make us happy compared to what will actually improve happiness, the ways in which we can improve our satisfaction with relationships, and meaningful cognitive and behavioral changes that can have a big impact on one's psychological well-being, this class will review research on how to achieve a more satisfying life.  Although this is not a "self-help" or "self-care" course, by reviewing the scientific literature and assigning exercises for personal practice this course will offer meaningful experiences for self-reflection and insight into how techniques can be applied to one's own daily life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUYING THE AMERICAN DREAM: AMERICAN CONSUMER CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The health of the American economy and, at times, the strength of our spirit as a people are measured by how much we spend on consumer goods.  Both individually and collectively, we are defined not only by what we purchase, but by the act of shopping itself. How did we become a nation of consumers?  Why do we spend?  What drives consumer demand?  Already in the late 19th century, middle-class values were shifting from thrift to indulgence.  At the time, however, we were still a producer nation and remained so for much of the 20th century.  More recently, the decline of manufacturing in the United States and the outsourcing of production in an increasingly globalized context have done little to cool our love affair with consumer goods.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Using an interdisciplinary American Studies approach that explores the intersections of history, material culture, gender and sexuality, race, immigration and ethnicity, and the built environment, this course examines the nature and expansion of mass consumption, the democratization of desire, types of consumer behaviors, the meanings attached to consumer goods and the act of spending, the role of technology and advertising, and the impact of mass consumption upon the built environment.  Neither a singular consumer monoculture nor American exceptionalism is assumed, moreover.  Different groups consume for different reasons and assign different meanings to the goods they purchase.  We will investigate consumption patterns over time among women, African-Americans, immigrants and their descendants, sexual minorities, and youth.  At the same time, studies of consumption within ethnic communities, in particular, suggest the creation of a transnational identity.  As a result, we will also explore globalized consumer products and patterns.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, the course will look at the various kinds of controls to which American consumerism has been subjected.  For example, regulation is a control; so are recession and war.  Regulation controls the supply side, affecting what goods are available, while recession puts restraints on consumer spending.  War achieves both.  No less powerful are the internal restraints arising from movements ranging from organized boycotts to visions of simplicity that embrace a more conscious or environmentally friendly consumption in some instances and, in rarer instances, eschew consumption altogether.  Fortunately for global manufacturers and American retailers alike, the Spartan practices of radical critics like "No Impact Man" have had limited appeal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Specifically, we will read literature relating to cultural, social, historical, and ecological aspects of the bay and watershed. We will dedicate a third of our time to reading and discussing the literature, a third on experiential and observational activities, and a third on reflecting on what we have observed. The aim of the course is to instill a fascination relating to Narragansett Bay, and to reflect on the relationship between people and the bay.&lt;BR&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Explain a joke; kill it?  We'll keep it alive on life support in this short philosophical survey of what's funny.  We will consider a range of theories of laughter and humor, from both analytic and practical perspective.  To evaluate these theories, we will apply them to various types of humor, such as comedies, jokes, and especially in visual illustration such as cartoons, and the like.  The serious business of analysis will share the stage with our engagement with funny business as well as creating our own.  Throughout, we will consider the ethical issues of humor and laughter as they arise in the theories and the practices of humor. Course requires a sense of humor and will involve active participation, even performing humor.  Several papers and a project of either analyzing something comedic or developing your own.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMERICAN GOVERNMENT: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW FOR THE NEXT ELECTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Two hundred years ago the ideas of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness became the essence of an emerging nation that soon represented a new paradigm for the rest of the hemisphere and the rest of the world. Today, the US population is more than 300 million people distributed into 50 states, not to mention the US territories. Context is different, we have cellphones, TVs, internet, social networks, and other gadgets that allow us to have access to information at a speed that was impossible to imagine in 1776. But we still look for answers to similar questions. How do you govern a country that is so big and diverse? How do we know that a system that was created more than 200 years ago is still responsive and valid to our current needs? In addition to these questions we will discuss the constitutional foundations of the American political system and we will connect them to relevant issues: how democratic is the Electoral College? Why is the idea of universal healthcare more controversial in the United States than in other advanced democracies? Why do we see increasing polarization between the major parties? What role should the media play in the political process?&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RUSSIA: PAST AND PRESENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to introduce students to the history and culture of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union.  The themes that will be developed in the course include: the historical process of imperial formation, transformation, and collapse; the spatial dimension in Russian imperial history; Islam in Russia; reform, modernization, and "westernization" in the Russian context; migration and human mobility; and political violence and revolution.  The question of Russian "national" identity, both historically and today, will be an over-arching theme of this course.  From a methodological perspective, therefore, the themes and topics addressed in this course are designed to help students contextualize contemporary economic, political, and social developments in the Russian Federation. &lt;BR&gt;      This course is organized around assigned readings and in-class discussions designed to isolate and illuminate the various scholarly and disciplinary elements embedded in RISD's art and design curriculum.  In combination with engaged reading of the assigned textbook for the course and the content provided through "mini-lectures", films, videos, and literary works will serve to extend the imaginary and visual dimensions of the course.  The reading and discussion of historically-based works of literature within the context of Russian history as well as the viewing and discussion of a film on contemporary Russia will, therefore, help elucidate and humanize the various themes developed in the course.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most young people have developed their perspectives on the Vietnam War primarily through the medium of film. We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While we eat foods from over 60 different plant families, we rarely stop to consider how any of those plants might be related from an evolutionary standpoint, or why we might eat one species of the family (say the potato), but not another (the deadly nightshade). This course will look at the context in which the plants we eat exist among the hundreds of thousands of plants on this planet. Organized around the human culinary uses of plants, the class will explore the evolutionary relationships between foods, and discover what it is, that links them together.  We will examine the parts of plants humans consume, and in so doing discover how taste and nutritional value found in leaves, seeds, and roots, is linked to nutrition and protection for plants themselves. The seminar will culminate with a botanical feast, created by the class and featuring unique dishes created from taxonomically related groups of plants.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINA IN FILM: CONTESTED PASTS, UNCERTAIN FUTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From the very first "electric shadow plays" that were shown in Shanghai teahouses in the 1890s, to the domestic 3D blockbusters that gross billions of RMB today, Chinese films have engaged complicated issues of national and cultural identity.  Cinematic depictions of China as a land of timeless splendor, an arena fraught with political intrigue, or a probable yet dystopian future all include value judgments about greater "China" and its relation with the world.  This interdisciplinary class presents cinema as a historical genre that probes competing narratives of Chinese pasts, presents, and futures.  We will engage independent and commercial films from Mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, and situate these works within the historical contexts in which they were made.  How does film's status as an affect-driven medium - and its need for financial backing - shape the kinds of stories to be told?  And what will be the fate of Chinese film as it transitions from a domestic to an international genre?  By the end of the class, students will have familiarity with representative works of Chinese cinema, as well as a better understanding of Chinese history.  More importantly, they will realize that "China," like film itself, is perpetually in flux.   &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Why are the Elgin Marbles in London, and not on the Acropolis?  Why do there seem to be as many mummies in France as there are in Egypt? asks Sharon Waxman in her book Loot (2008). This seminar will examine the changing role of antiquities in the post-imperialist world, and access the moral and ethical questions raised by archaeologists, curators, collectors and lawyers regarding the plunder of ancient sites to feed an international art market.  We will also review legal standards regarding cultural properties (1970 UNESCO Convention,  1991 NAGPRA, and 1995 Unidroit Convention) and how they have impacted the protection of ancient archaeological sites, forced the return of many art treasures and lesser artifacts, and become big headaches for everyone involved in the preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Also offered as HAVC-C734; register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will consider the political and cultural landscapes of 5th century BCE Athens, 19th century England, and 20th century United States. Students will read and discuss works from each period within its surrounding social context. In addition to dramatic texts, readings will include historical surveys of musical theatre and of the three periods. Students will be expected to produce two 3 to 5 page essays synthesizing the social issue about which a playwright/composer wrote with the resulting dramatic work; a mid-semester exam and a final project. Class meetings will include lecture, discussion and presentations. There will be a two-day field trip to New York to see musical plays and meet with theatre professionals.

In this course, with the assistance of philosophers such as Hannah Arendt and Niccolo Machiavelli, we will address these topics through lens of political philosophy to determine what the series can teach us about the nature and purpose of politics and power. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course looks at key issues relating to migration, displacement and refugeeism in the world today. It frames these issues in terms of the factors which force movements and restrict the movement of people across national boundaries. It considers both the causes and consequences of such movements in relation to legal, political, economic, social and cultural factors.  It looks at the images of citizen, nation and state that are constructed through the regulation of national boundaries, and compares these with the goals, identities and cultural processes of the people who move or are across regulated borders. In working out how to think about people who live at the edge of conventional social science categories we will reconsider such basic concepts as ethnicity, identity, nation, culture and homeland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPARATIVE VERTEBRATE ANATOMY: FORM AND FUNCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the form and function of the vertebrate body using a comparative approach. We will study the following anatomical structures and how they work by comparing them across vertebrate animals: eye/vision, ear/hearing, nose/smell, throat/taste, teeth and jaws/chewing, heart/circulation, lung/oxygen exchange, intestinal tract/digestion, kidneys/protein and electrolyte balance, musculoskeletal system/locomotion, lymph tissue/immune system, reproductive tract/reproduction, and the brain and spinal cord/nervous system. Reference animals will include those for which anatomy is best-known, including humans, dogs, cats, horses, cows, chickens, bullfrogs, and salmon. Each session will begin with an examination of the structure of an anatomical region followed by an exploration of its function, including movements and processes in example species. For their final project, students will be encouraged to explore a highly developed or specialized form and its function, such how kangaroos jump, how octopuses see, and how giant pandas digest bamboo. Through this course, we will demystify and develop an appreciation for the wondrous complexity of the vertebrate body and its role in art and design. This is a lecture-style course that includes in-class discussion, research and activities. Course work includes weekly readings and written responses, a series of completed anatomical sketches, and a final project.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART OF COMMUNICATING SCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. They also discover that science communication is about more than delivering just the facts. It can be entertaining, surprising, and controversial. The general topic is changing biodiversity: how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world. Through a series of exercises students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it visually. The science content will be delivered through lectures, readings, videos, and a visit to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete, meaningful, visible, and accessible. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D, animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces such as galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes weekly reading and response questions, in-studio exercises, weekly assignments, three completed artworks, and a comprehensive final project, which includes a written paper and a public engagement piece.  &lt;br&gt; The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as ILLUS-3912 or IDISC-3912; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;BR&gt; Students must plan and register for both SCI-3912 and ILLUS-3912 or IDISC-3912 and will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts elective credits.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SOCIOLOGY OF BUSINESS, ORGANIZATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Why are the Elgin Marbles in London, and not on the Acropolis?  Why do there seem to be as many mummies in France as there are in Egypt? asks Sharon Waxman in her book Loot (2008). This seminar will examine the changing role of antiquities in the post-imperialist world, and access the moral and ethical questions raised by archaeologists, curators, collectors and lawyers regarding the plunder of ancient sites to feed an international art market.  We will also review legal standards regarding cultural properties (1970 UNESCO Convention,  1991 NAGPRA, and 1995 Unidroit Convention) and how they have impacted the protection of ancient archaeological sites, forced the return of many art treasures and lesser artifacts, and become big headaches for everyone involved in the preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Also offered as HPSS-C734; register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE FOURTH ESTATE: MASS MEDIA POLITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As Agenda Setting Theory states, "[t]he press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about." (Cohen, 1963). The press plays an important role in any democracy, and in the case of the United States, it also has a special place in public life, one guaranteed in the constitution by the first amendment. However, in recent times the media has contributed to a polarization of political attitudes by framing stories through an ideologically-driven lens. This has become evident in public opinion polls, and at the ballot box. This course will introduce students to the complex process through which politicians use media to get elected, stay in office, and achieve policy goals. Additionally, we will examine the role that the media plays as the fourth estate, by informing the citizenry on the issues that are crucial to government and the sociopolitical process. Through varied in-class exercises and case studies, students will learn to analyze and assess the trustworthiness and veracity of news outlets.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE NEW ENGLAND LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Richly varied and dynamic, the New England landscape has been remade many times over, beginning with the arrival of European colonists, through successive waves of deforestation and reforestation, industrialization, the development of leisure and tourism, and today's post-industrial economy. This course explores the different elements of New England's cultural landscape as well as the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and natural forces that have shaped that landscape over four centuries. While examining what different places look like and how they have changed over time, we will pay close attention to the various meanings assigned to them by those who possess and inhabit them. We will also ask what different landscapes can tell us about who holds power, and how power is expressed and resisted. We look at the built environment because it is a valuable primary source in the work of cultural historians, but also because "place" is in itself an important player worthy of exploration and understanding in its own right. We shape places, but they also shape us.  By observing and analyzing cities and suburbs, farms and forests, beaches and burial grounds, mansions and mills, townhouses and triple-deckers, colleges and casinos, parks and ports, ski slopes and shipyards, tourist destinations and transit systems, we will attempt to mine the landscape for insights into what makes New England distinctive and what forms our regional identity, keeping in mind the ways in which New England's cultural landscape is also a reflection of the landscape of the United States. Finally, we will consider the ways in which the New England landscape continues to be shaped by new forces, both local and global, as well as an increasingly volatile climate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Together we will explore the social constructs of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, and ability through readings, videos, in-class activities, and class discussion. Informed by psychological theory and research, we will examine the impact that these labels have on a person's identity development, societal positioning, and mental and physical health and well-being. By the end of the class, students will be able to explain the advantages and challenges that individuals and societies face as we become more interconnected in a diverse world. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Coursework will be tailored to the needs of individual participants. To obtain permission to register for the course, send an email to the instructor with the following information: your name, major, year in school (junior, senior, graduate student), and a description of (a) your studio degree project, as you currently conceive of it, and (b) the area, topic, or question in history, philosophy, or the social sciences that you want to explore. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>(HI)STORIES OF REPAIR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Focusing on stories of repair in its many manifestations, his course examines the concept of "repair" from as many angles as we can develop.  Why do people repair things?  What gets repaired and what doesn't?  What does it mean to say something is "beyond repair"? What is the particular value of a repaired thing, and how is it different from the value of something that has never been broken? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Taking advantage of a year-long exhibition at the RISD Museum called "Repair and Design Futures", the course will combine instruction in the process of collecting oral histories, with a topical focus on stories of repair.  We will explore traditions of repair, habits of repair, processes of repair, the aesthetics and poetics of repair, as well as places and cultures of repair, through the stories people tell about these processes.  Students will examine practices of repair on many levels, moving from the concrete and material to the ecological, the ethical, and the metaphorical.  In all cases, repair will be examined "as an active process of remembering  - an ongoing acknowledgment of use, abuse, accident and/or error  - that insists on not forgetting the thing and its history" (Kate Irvin, Costume and Textiles Curator, RISD Museum).  In other words, we will be exploring, collecting and finding compelling ways to present (hi)stories of repair. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Pairing a range of films with essential readings in urban studies and geography, in this class we will investigate how cities and films inform one another. We will examine social and historical contexts for the development of representations of urban space through film. We will consider not just geographies represented within films, but also how cultures and economies of film-going, film production, and film industries inform urban environments - and vice versa. The course provides an introduction to human geography, urban studies and theories of urban development through key geographic concepts such as space, place, power, difference, and nature, as well as debates about contemporary urban politics. We will also consider the dynamics of socio-environmental world-making embedded within film visions of urban greening, postcarbon energy technologies, and postcapitalist alternatives.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ECONOMICS OF ART &amp; DESIGN: HOW ARTISTS AND DESIGNERS DEFINE VALUE OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Value of any commodity is not fixed by one person or even organization. Once it enters the marketplace, a commodity is being evaluated in the process of interaction between the seller and the buyer. In this course, we will look at the interaction between artists and customers as they the negotiate value of objects of art. The latter, of course, are not an ordinary commodity. Still, when monetary value is in question, it is determined in the course of market or quasi-market transactions. The course, therefore, will pay attention to the market as a specific social institution, with its own well-established patterns of interaction. Concepts of scarcity, demand, rationality, and information are central to the market and will be studied in the course.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Art is being traded within certain cultural and social structures. We will explore how these structures impact the behavior of actors in the art valuation and trading process and how they shape the marketplace. As the marketplace transforms over time, control over the valuation process shifts between three main groups: the artists, the middlemen, and the government. These power shifts will be at the focus of our inquiry. Historically, the exploration will span a hundred and fifty years, from the formation of market for French Impressionist paintings to the strange economics of the art of Damian Hirst. Historical comparison will be the central method in this course.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course will be divided into four parts. In the first part, we will look at different perspectives of art valuation: the economic, the sociological, and the cultural. The second part will discuss transactions between artists and non-market entities, such as guilds and guild-like institutions, patronage chains, and the government. The emergence of artist-entrepreneur and interaction between artists and those groups that participate in the shaping of the marketplace (such as art critics and museums) will be the subject of Part Three. Here we will also discuss the formation of artists' networks, the process that acquired economic significance in the late 19th century. In the fourth part we will investigate the changes in today's arts market, specifically the emergence of corporate structures, such as auction houses, and the use of branding as the main tool of marketing of art. This kind of corporate behavior tends to benefit very few artists, while distorting the marketplace and increasing the power of middlemen. We will finish with a discussion of a possibility of returning to the relatively egalitarian artist networks of the late nineteenth century as a counterbalance to the power of dealers and auction houses. Changes in art marketplace will be discussed within the conceptual framework that includes trust, cultural value, symbol, agency and structure.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EMBODYING FEMINISMS/FEMINIST EMBODIMENTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>For much of its history, feminism has revolved around and centered on the gendered body, whether in terms of the body contextualized within time, space, and culture; in terms of the mind and body as oppositional forces; in terms of health, reproduction, or representation; or in terms of the body as part of or outside "nature." This course will examine feminist relationships to the gendered body in terms of various social and historical locations, as well as in relationship to dis/ability, queerness, reproduction, and the "natural" and built environment.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Cape Town, South Africa is predicted to be the first major city to run out of water. Day Zero, when the taps will run dry, is expected in Spring 2018.  How did we get here, and how do we fix it?  Learn the science behind the planet's water and how humanity interacts with it.  We will examine the causes and results of drought, salt-water contamination of wells and streams, shrinking aquifers and more. The goals of this course are threefold: (1) To clarify how water works in earth's systems (2) To outline how humans interact and leave their mark on every step of these cycles and (3) To encourage students to understand these water issues as challenges in need of the intelligent and creative solutions that they are equipped to deliver.  No prior science background is required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

Students will make artworks that investigate their emerging concerns within and across their study subjects, while building a strong interdisciplinary critique group and exposing these works to a set of experimental critique structures designed to support this challenging task. Experimentation with form will be encouraged as we explore ways of manifesting liminal areas of interest as 2D and 3D objects, models, performances, conceptual propositions, performance lectures, etc. The works produced in this course, coupled with the understandings and questions that emerge from the critique process, will provide a meaningful foundation for BRDD capstone presentations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to BROWN | RISD Dual Degree students only. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as LAEL-4100; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;Br&gt; Open to non-BRDD students pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many steps are involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Restricted to Industrial Design juniors and above&lt;br&gt; Also offered as APPAR-2494 for Apparel majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class will cover basic camera optics and lighting techniques necessary to generate high quality digital images for either print or digital portfolio applications. The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS COMMUNICATIONS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications I is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on design research methods. Together, we will spend the fall semester casting about, planning and prototyping towards some kind of design proposal or product for execution in the spring. We think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. On the tool for design side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We use writing to help clarify and crystalize the thesis plan. On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of writing and how to think about what they want and need. We talk about the thesis as a tool for explaining the design but also as a tool for helping you advance your career goals. At the end of the course, you will have a partially complete draft of your thesis. which will set you up for an excellent spring.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class will cover basic camera optics and lighting techniques necessary to generate high quality digital images for either print or digital portfolio applications. The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt; This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business.&lt;BR&gt; The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications II is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on completing your thesis. Together, we will spend the spring semester finishing the thesis and thesis book that you proposed at the end of Graduate Thesis Communications I. We continue to think about writing as a design tool and as a communication tool. For this course, we put more emphasis on the communication aspect. Together, we will continue to refine and strengthen the manner by which you explain your thesis to yourself and others. We will think about audience, voice, structure, and form. We will explore different ways of communicating the same idea in different contexts and mediums (visual, oral, written). We will examine how to share our work and with whom. At the end of the course, you will have a complete thesis.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, ID graduate students only Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this class we practice a variety of digital and freehand methods of design exploration and visual communication used by designers. These sketching and rendering skills are ideal for anyone who has to understand and resolve form while communicating ideas within interdisciplinary environments. We will focus on the redesign of a few objects, starting with some sketching from the ideation phase through to a final solution that describes the aesthetic and emotive intentions, as well as demonstrates knowledge of functional or unique manufacturing requirements. The class is built on the belief that strong two-dimensional skills remain the essential tool for product designers.  &lt;BR&gt;  Students attending the first module will be required to participate in the final critique on the final day of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN &amp; FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There is an element of fiction in all design work and design is always about imagination. We imagine the time when the objects and services we make become available to users and change their lives. Mostly, we imagine changing their lives for the better. A lot of designers call themselves storytellers but if that's true, they are terrible at it. "It just works" is an amazing product pitch but a boring story.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What is the role of storytelling in design? How can we benefit from (or exploit) the affordances of narrative? How can we navigate the blurry spaces between prototype and sales pitch? Between dreamer, hustler, visionary, and con artist? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a highly collaborative class. Drawing from the techniques of science fiction, fantasy, and the foresight community, we will explore how world- and scenario- building can be used to enrich our designs. We will experiment with the tools of fiction and genre to examine our ideas from new angles and to find new ways of presenting our concepts to an audience. We will also consider the pitfalls and shortcomings of the approach.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to all students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The aim of the course is to open a window on the complex and multifaceted present design environment. A preliminary overview about the major historic design movements will be followed by an extensive description of the design's state of the art together with a spot on the latest trends. Students will be invited to think and tinker, learning how to approach a design project, how to formulate proper research questions and how to use analog and digital prototyping to experiment, validate and communicate their own ideas. They will also initiate a dialogue with forms, functions, and interactions, defining the borders of the design activity and the actual role of designers. The main goal of the course is to get students familiar with the design vocabulary and with the basic tools involved in design processes.   &lt;br&gt; Areas covered: Ideas and concepts creation, quantitative and qualitative research, sketch models making, digital fabrication, physical computing, project's narrative and storytelling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;Br&gt; Registration of Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>(re)DESIGNING SELF-CARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare." -- Audre Lorde &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; "Self-care" has seen a resurgence in the cultural zeitgeist, and subsequently designers have identified it as a new "design opportunity." In its adoption by some designers, however, self-care has been abstracted, commodified, and de-personalized; it has been removed from its original radical origins as a practice of resistance and healing for marginalized groups. How might designers utilize the cultural momentum of the concept of "self-care" in service of those in need of it? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will look critically at the adoption of self-care by designers, examining the commodification and decoupling of the self in current "self-care" products. How do we return self-care to the personal, and discuss its manifestations for different intersections of race, gender, class, ability, and neurodiversity? How might new approaches to self-care look?  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Also offered as IDISC-1543; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Soft Robotics is an extension of conventional robotics that is especially good at wet and fragile handling applications. Soft Robotics focuses on micro-controller directed pneumatic actuators controlling squishy combinations of pressurized air and flexible materials such as silicone rubber and sprung steel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this course, you will be designing and making, working Soft Robotic prototypes using the Harvard Biodesign Lab's Soft Robotics Toolkit. In combination with low material costs, accessible coding community and increasingly accessible rapid prototyping technologies (3D printers, laser cutters, CNC mills) the Toolkit enables the easy and affordable, design, fabrication, modeling, characterization and control of fully functional, Soft Robotic devices. The final devices will complete against several other institutions in the 2019 Soft Robotics Design Competition. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CMF: COLOUR, MATERIALS, FINISH (COUNTERFACTUALS, MATERIALS, FUTURES)</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we'll approach object design through three different 'windows' of time. Our first window will be trends and Colour Materials Finish (CMF). The CMF and trend forecasting industries provide insight to commercial design teams about technological, aesthetic and social developments, (often at the edges of the mainstream), that might effect how products should look, traditionally two to three years out. With guidance from CMF industry experts, we'll research our own trends, to try and form a picture of what's happening, or what's about to happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our second window will be futures. We'll look at some techniques and traps in the field of futures, to help us think about what might or might not happen. Futures and trends of course depend on past events. But the most creative and startling contributions to design and culture can sometimes seem to break with the past, to reexamine received wisdom, and reveal unquestioned assumptions.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our third window will be that of the counterfactual. We'll imagine what a different history might imply for present day visual and material design? What if computer technology had continued to  be developed by textile practitioners? What if the space race had been the deep sea race? What if Europeans had been 'discovered' by Native Americans? We'll use these trends, futures and alternate realities as seeds from which to develop our own material and technological experimental design work. Which who knows, might catch the eye of a trend forecaster and feed in to our future present. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CREATIVE APPLICATIONS OF MACHINE LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the subject of machine learning and its applications in the field of design, particularly for creating interactive applications on the web. Students will gain a top-level understanding of the history and current state of machine learning, as well as an understanding of the frontiers of data organization and style transfer for image, video, and audio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; During the course, students will learn how to build interactive systems using a variety of inputs including web cameras, datasets, and audio streams. This course will also explore the philosophical and moral implications of emerging machine learning technologies and their impact on society at large. Valid outcomes from the course may be tools, products, or art, and may focus on practical or conceptual/critical applications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will not cover, nor assumes knowledge of, the technical or mathematical details of machine learning. Instead, it will focus on how to integrate available tools into existing interactive applications. While no specific knowledge of ML or programming experience is required, you should consider yourself "good with computers" and any familiarity with HTML/CSS/Javascript will be helpful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; ID majors only &lt;BR&gt; Open to junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>EDITORIAL ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Magazines, newspapers and other publications rely heavily on pictures to illuminate messages initiated by writers, and unlike any other genre of illustration, the editorial field gives voice to the artist. In this alternately reactive and expressive line of work, the illustrator engages in a powerful partnership with the written word, effectively becoming an author of opinions and ideas. This class will approach several editorial assignments, all of which involve an illustrated response to written text. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>STYLE &amp; SUBSTANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is an art of visual communication. Style is simply the illustrator's vocabulary. Substance is what the illustrator has chosen to express. The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT'S YOUR STORY?</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When we choose a story to read, retell, or illustrate, that choice reveals something about ourselves. What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMALIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Animals have enjoyed a prominent place in art for as long as humans have been creating it, beginning with the caves in Lascaux. Along the way they have figured prominently in myths fables and allegories, fulfilling symbolic roles in a wealth of picture books, and appeared as frequent players in visual metaphors employed by editorial illustrators. This course will provide opportunities for students to work within a variety of illustration genres, finding their own approach to working with representations of animal life. There will be in-depth exploration of creature anthropomorphism and its uses- from social and political satire to its capabilities in a wide range of storytelling methods. From JJ Granville to Spiegelman's Maus, to children's book greats like Richard Scarry and Arthur Geisert, the human-animal/animal-human is an enduring motif that will continue to be reinvented and expanded upon. Students will have the ability to channel projects and assignments towards formats of their choosing - including painting and other gallery-based practices, children's publishing, artist books, comics and zines. &lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>VISIBLE CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A society's history is written in its stones. From the dystopias of Gotham City or Grand Theft Auto, the hive mind of the Borg and the ecstatic asceticism of the Shakers, to the suburban conformity of Levittown and the Sphinx half buried in sand, every city, every society, is an embodiment of ideas, history, geography, and beliefs. Each built environment has its own logic, both architectural and cultural. With some provocative writings about the phenomenon of the city as inspiration, you will be asked to conceptualize a place and bring it to life visually. The essence of a city - its buildings, pathways, public and private spaces - depends on how you define the character of its people, its government, its history, its geographic siting and even its language.&lt;BR&gt; After defining a back-story in broad strokes, you will begin researching the implications of those choices visually. Working from thumbnails and sketches to finished conceptualization, you will explore compelling physical and conceptual viewpoints, with a variety of possibilities in the use of media and technique. Rather than limiting ourselves to purely pragmatic architecture, the class will be searching for imaginative visualizations, where form becomes poetic metaphor suggestive of narrative.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LANDSCAPE PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Throughout history, the natural environment has been a subject of charm and awe for the artist, from the delicately painted frescoes in ancient Roman homes to the 16th century, when the landscape transcended the role of 'background', and gained momentum as a sublime subject in its own right. This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From the disturbingly exotic pictures of the Underworld by Hieronymus Bosch and the twisted visual puzzles of M.C. Escher, to the mid-20th Century comic characters of Stan Lee and classic 1950's science fiction films, fantasy images provide a rich source of inspiration for the contemporary artist/illustrator. In this course, we will study the art of Surrealist artists such as Magritte and Max Ernst, the unique fruit and vegetable portraits of Archimboldo, investigate the abstract dream imagery of Hilma Af Klint and Carl Jung, and the seminal graphic novels of Sue Coe (Porkopolis) and Art Spiegelman (Maus). We will interpret text and film as we create our own fantasy paintings working with appropriated imagery, collage, and painting mediums such as oil, acrylic, gouache and watercolor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERMEDIATE DIGITAL ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>One commonality amongst all illustrators is the ability to draw. This course builds on principles of traditional drawing, color theory, composition, and with a focus on observational drawing using digital tablet devices. Students will expand on techniques learned at the introductory level to broaden their use of digital mark making tools. Weekly classroom exercise in the first two-thirds of the semester range from careful studies of objects and figures in space, to capturing landscape settings; with the last third engaged in exploring painting from imagination. More involved homework assignments will challenge students to adapt previously acquired drawing skills translated into the digital medium. The main computer application to be used in the course is Photoshop, with an introduction to Painter toward the end of the semester. The goal of the class is to give students a strong foundation in digital painting that can be adapted to their future professional Illustration practice.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to play is a complex activity that is at the core of human learning. From Monopoly to poker, Doom to the baseball diamond, games allow us to explore social interactions, take risks, set goals, develop skills and expand our imaginations while entertaining us without serious consequences. What makes a game fun? Or memorable? In this class, we will explore the intersections of learning, experimentation, and play. In our constructed projects, we will search for innovative ways to expand or reinvent game traditions. Through individual and collaborative projects, we will examine how game mechanics (rules/systems) thoughtfully combined with game aesthetics (visuals/story) can be used to craft engaging, memorable and informative user/player experiences. Our goal is to develop primarily non-digital games that are conceptually innovative responses to various questions you pose related to play. Quality assurance and usability concerns will be explored through focus group play tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURING SOUND: MUSIC + ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration, along with painting, printmaking and many other visual art practices, is continually intertwined with music. From illustrators collaborating on videos, packaging and promotion, to creating graphic novel and picture biographies of musicians and musical movements, the tradition of connecting the visual to the acoustic has a rich history. &lt;BR&gt;   Music will always need to be celebrated larger and in a more tactile way than on a screen-we are seeing the enduring inventiveness of the gig poster, and even the 12" LP cover is still alive as a canvas. Projects in this class will explore promotional, interpretive, and investigative approaches as they relate to musicians, lyrics and titles, as well as parallels between music and visual art. Students will have the chance to interpret musical works in a number of ways, including through narrative approaches, using sculpture, animation and GIFs, and other less conventional means.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be exploration of analogous aspects of music and visual art-sound and color, time based works, performative aspects and related ideas (e.g.: the movements of the hand while drawing/painting as analogous to playing an instrument). There will be some focus too, on genres and movements where music and art have close relationships, ie: psychedelia, pop and op art, comics and set design.  Lectures and discussion will also be devoted to learning about artists who create both visual and musical work.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. Emphasis is placed on Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with show critical writing or discussions. Additionally there are weekly readings, a research project, quizzes and a final exam. Textbook required. Books will be on reserve at the RISD Library and available for purchase at a student discount. Study images are made available on RISD Digication.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  Registration by Illustration Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is visual communication: meaning made visible. Visual thinking, the creative process by which all successful illustration is developed, constitutes the development of an articulate images through thorough, iterative exploration of ideas. This class emphasizes process over finish, idea over application and significance over style-exploring both ways of seeing and ways of showing. Coursework will encourage conceptual invention and application fundamental to an understanding of what the practice of illustration is and can be. The object of the course is to strengthen the students' inventive talents and interpretive skills - and thereby to augment their ability to articulate complex ideas with clarity, eloquence and power.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Building on the skills and sensibilities developed in ILLUS 2000: Visual Thinking, this course will address a range of strategic considerations important for the articulation of ideas. While emphasis will remain on methods for encouraging conceptual aptitude and innovation, there will be greater focus on specific forms of communication. Practical issues such as the nature of audience and the context for interpretation will be matters of concern, as will vehicles for communication and the handling of media. The basic aim of this course is to enable the student to discover a creative identity and develop an itinerary for upperclass study; its larger goal is to wed communicative purpose to artistic voice.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will create a comprehensive visual essay on a topic that they propose. Participants will engage in extensive investigation and create a series of images that explore, reveal, and/or explain a particular subject or concept. Emphasis will be placed on the development of content through research, and the organization of consistent refined works through presentations that synthesize ideas as pictorial or graphic imagery that may include or refer to textual information. Final presentations may be printed, digital, exhibited as originals or include cross-platform or time-based imagery. A wide range of commercial applications and opportunities will be explored. The semester will begin with short projects that introduce useful skills and approaches. The remainder of the term will focus on a single conceptual endeavor. Contemporary and historic examples of visual essay will be examined and discussed. Student research may lead beyond campus. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE HUMAN FIGURE IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will learn to depict the human figure more effectively within a spatial and compositional context. The classical principles of pictorial design emphasized in the course will enable students to create compelling and visually dynamic work. These principles strengthen visual unity by strategically repeating various formal elements within an image while contrasting those elements in order to provide a sense of balance.   Master works by Diebenkorn, Cassatt, Sorolla, Hopper, Degas, and Vermeer, among others, will be analyzed in order to gain insight from their compositions and use of color. Students will execute several small-- scale master studies to assimilate those lessons more deeply.   Students will also explore the narrative potential of the human figure in context as they develop personal imagery. Sources for such imagery will be chosen by each student and may include observation, imagination, memory, photo reference or any combination thereof. Students may work in any color or monochromatic 2-D medium - drawing, painting, collage, mixed media, or digital - based on individual preference and expressive need.  During each class, students will have the option to work from direct observation of human figures placed in environments. The models will be set in long poses to allow time for compositional and narrative ideas to develop. Students may also use class time to develop their own imagery from non-observational sources. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective. &lt;BR&gt;Open to all students; sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Based on memory, dreams, fantasy, travel, and intuitive stirrings, each student's own journal will be the source of a group of paintings executed in a variety of mediums such as oil, acrylic and watercolor. In addition to their own journals, students may create images/paintings based on pertinent film, memoirs, essays, or other reflective texts by well-known and lesser-known authors.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustrated typography and hand lettering are enjoying a wonderfully prominent place in the visual landscape of design, publishing  and illustration, and have become an increasingly vital part of many illustrator's professional portfolios. What can illustrated type and it's particular characteristics provide as an alternative to established typefaces? How does an illustrator find the right balance between form and function, expression and readability? This course will provide the opportunity to employ drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, photography, digital tools and other media in the creation of unique letterforms. Students will be encouraged to experiment with non-traditional materials -including three-dimensional ones. Beginning with an introduction to basic typographic elements, terminology, and font families, students will move into creating their own unique lettering for projects including posters, book covers, and packaging.  Typography will be the central focus, but students will have leeway as to the degree with which it is integrated with other illustrative imagery. Along with these projects students will create a complete unique typeface over the course of the semester. Relevant issues related to hand drawn text-type for comics, picture books, and graphic novels - including appropriateness, readability and voice, will also be covered.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Changing Narrative will explore the challenges and possibilities of innovative storytelling structure: non-linear, interactive, multimedia. In this class, students will create inventive work at the intersection of physical and digital media, the old and the new. Students will be introduced to classic dramatic structures across cultures-Asian Kishotenketsu, Freytag's pyramid, Shakespearean tragedy-and learn fundamental digital skills via class demonstrations and exercises. Drawing from these patterns and tools, students will then seek to unveil new storytelling possibilities granted by modern technology (computer animation, touch screen interaction, hypermedia) to traditional artforms (illustration, comics, gaming). What happens when a comic's panel starts to move? Where does a story go if the reader is allowed to make decisions? Students will investigate these creative avenues and create playful, hybrid stories.&lt;BR&gt;   Along the course of the semester, assignments will notably include short-form animated illustrations, experiments with gamebooks and cartoon strips, culminating in a final, long-form narrative project.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; This course fulfills EITHER the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement OR the Computer Literacy requirement, not both, for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LARGE WOODCUT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the world's first print technique, woodcut had a profound affect on the development of all printing -especially the Japanese woodblock process which has influenced so many artists. It uses minimal technology, requiring only a sturdy table, a few simple cutting and inking tools, and a wooden spoon to print the block. Despite the simplicity of the medium, resulting prints are as individual as the artist who makes them. An artist is able to make many identical prints of their image, which makes woodcut a great tool for experimenting with your ideas. Whether you enjoy work with a bold graphic quality or a delicate organic line, woodcut is an ideal medium for those that enjoy the physicality of materials. The class will cover the basics of woodcut prints to gain an understanding of the three components of this process: color separation, carving, and printing. Participants will learn about the required materials and tools, how to safely and effectively cut an image into the woodblock, and how to print it. The class will focus on how to organize and print large scale, complex, nuanced multicolored woodcuts. Reduction and multi-block techniques will be shown as a means of developing personal imagery. This one-of-a- kind course gives students a traditional printmaking skill that is environmentally friendly, can be done at home, on any scale.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SILKSCREENED POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since before the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsides" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course begins with the investigation of Dragons, compelling monstrous and mythological creatures found throughout the history of art in various cultures. Students will research historic forms and consider the purposes dragons and other monsters serve in various contexts, in preparation for designing and building their own "dragon".  Multiple theories of aesthetics relating to sculpture will be presented keeping in mind that three-dimensional objects are among the oldest and most expressive forms of representation and can be considered both the most traditional and the most innovative of artistic endeavors. Key artists such as Donatello, Rodin, and Henry Moore will be studied. A premise of the class is that in breaking the constraints of the 2 dimensional canvas, sculpture has mass and volume, and occupies space in a way impossible to achieve in painting or drawing. Consequently, working in three dimensions provides previously unimagined challenges and opportunities, and creates new pathways for learning; Students in this class will therefore be encouraged to take an experimental approach to creating form. The knowledge and experience gained here should help students become better artists in general and in future artistic endeavors not directly related to the specific material presented in the course.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED DIGITAL PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital illustration has rapidly become commonplace or even standard in many art-related fields. As illustrators have moved into the digital realm, we find ourselves exploring traditional concepts of picturemaking with ever more complex software. Some software packages strive to mimic paint, ink and graphite, but these programs also give us the freedom to explore mark making in entirely different ways unavailable in traditional media, identifying digital programs as tools to reinforce traditional techniques of illustration.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt;  This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As visual artists, we all have a story to tell.  &lt;BR&gt; One of the keys to creating a convincing narrative is persuading your viewers of the believability of the world into which you invite them. The creation of graphic novels, games, animations, movies and theater sets often start with a world guide - a document that fully describes the setting. Sometimes these are simply textual or visual references and sometimes they are books in their own right; but regardless of form, their purpose is to make sure that all the creative people working on a project will build a consistent "reality".  &lt;BR&gt; This course is intended to familiarize students with the process of generating and illustrating the visual parameters of an invented environment in which a story happens - defining first the umbrella under which the story unfolds, then establishing a more particular space/time/habitat  that includes anything relevant to the story: environment, history, culture, clothing styles, architecture, animals, etc.  &lt;BR&gt; Beyond the invention of a setting for a visual narrative, in this course students will also learn how to design a style guide for intellectual property worlds (IP). Each will create a visual "bible" for envisioning their IP world-a document that clearly defines and describes the world within which the narrative unfolds.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Oil painting is one of the richest, most powerfully expressive mediums that exist.  It offers a vast diversity of approaches and provides the most flexibility of all the painting materials. To take advantage of that variety, certain technical knowledge is essential. This class is geared as a thorough introduction to the newer oil painter. Our early class focus will be on understanding materials through a variety of life study exercises. Focus on color and composition will promote effectively orchestrated images. Our ultimate goal will be to make powerful images that marry appropriate approaches to oil painting with personal vision. The class emphasis will balance the technical mastery of materials with the clarity of effective visual communication. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Weekly assignments often begin by reviewing the traditional role of women and men in American culture but through a contemporary lens, examining the astoundingly colorful range of gender and sex identities that cannot be limited to simply pink and blue. We'll turn stereotypes inside out, flip popular icons upside down, and rework familiar images from hallowed museums. We'll search for fresh depictions of abstract concepts like conception, contraception, relationships, power, etc. This course offers equal opportunity for XX's, XY's and those outside the binary..&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Illustrators invent all the time: a "concept" is nothing more than invention. This course aims to expand the illustrator's definition of and capacity for invention, both on the page and beyond. The object of invention herein is delight. Students in this course will conceive and develop three distinct projects - the for children, the second for adults, the third at the student's discretion. Each project in development will test its premise: it will expose inspiration to proof. The ultimate criterion for success, whatever form the project has taken, will be, "Is it delightful?". If an invention is both original and delightful it may well have commercial potential; while this is not the object of the course, commercial potential will of course be considered. Classes will ideally be of seminar size. They will consist of speculation, discussion, suggestion and critique: skull sessions. Such dialogue is essential to the generation and development of both premise and project; it will comprise the majority of class time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In a series of projects, students will gather sketches, drawings and photographs, and combine them to exist solidly and convincingly together in space.  We will discuss the importance of lighting, color, and value in creating a believable scene, and explore the methods and techniques used by illustrators and painters past and present.  Class time will be divided between the computer lab (where students will manipulate their images using Photoshop and other tools) and the studio, where illustrations and paintings will be completed using a variety of media, including pen and ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;  This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;Br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Working across print, digital, mobile and social media platforms, this course will challenge students to create innovative visual communication that motivates people around a social cause. Students will learn what makes a compelling brand, as well as a compelling story.    Throughout the course of the semester, students will create logos, typographic systems, and brand identities based in illustration. The brand identity will be applied to products &amp; packaging, web sites, social media, infographics, and printed materials. &lt;BR&gt;   Through a series of weekly &amp; bi-weekly assignments, students will build a portfolio of pieces that tie together as a unified, illustrated brand identity. Students are encouraged to conduct their own research &amp; interviews with local non-profit organizations as part of this course.

Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.   &lt;BR&gt; Techniques with paper pulp, polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (as low-relief and over armatures). Scavenged objects and supplies to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations are another way to create images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished with mixed media, collage and other treatments that unify the whole. Idea and technique come together so these illustrations will be anything but shallow.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORKING ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a survey course designed to enable students to develop a wide body of work in three-dimensional moving art pieces. Students are exposed to a large range of types of movement and the challenges inherent in getting those movements to operate smoothly. The pieces are made from a wide range of materials, including but not limited to wood, cardboard, wire, metal, plastic, Sculpey, and paint. &lt;br&gt; There are three elements in each project: the idea, mechanism and surface treatment. Assignments will be given based on the mechanism. Students bring the subject and story to the piece. The mechanisms covered include: action/ reaction, balance/ counter balance, whirlygig, cams and cranks, motion-triggered lights and sound. Molds will be incorporated into the assignments. All projects are painted. &lt;br&gt; This course requires students to develop a working knowledge of a range of tools, from simple hand tools to more complex tools available in our wood shop. Exercises and focused workshops on tool usage will be a fundamental part of the class. Prior experience with tools is helpful but not necessary. &lt;br&gt; The class culminates with a "Come Play With Us" show of students' completed projects. Elementary school children and the RISD Community are invited to play with the pieces, with an emphasis on fun. The projects have to work; they need to be built to withstand all types of child's play.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This 3-credit course is half of a 6-credit co-requisite course.  Students self-register for ILLUS-3912 or IDISC-3912: Art of Communicating Science via web registration.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration for the co-requisite course, SCI-W912: Art of Communicating Science is processed by Registrar's Office. Course not available via web registration.  &lt;br&gt; This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. They also discover that science communication is about more than delivering just the facts. It can be entertaining, surprising, and controversial. The general topic is changing biodiversity: how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world. Through a series of exercises students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it visually. The science content will be delivered through lectures, readings, videos, and a visit to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete, meaningful, visible, and accessible. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D, animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces such as galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes weekly reading and response questions, in-studio exercises, weekly assignments, three completed artworks, and a comprehensive final project, which includes a written paper and a public engagement piece.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills Illustration Concepts for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VIRTUAL REALITY FOR PALLIATIVE CARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Virtual Reality Design for Palliative Care is a pilot course designed to allow students to experiment purposefully in the creation of virtual reality environments. We will measure the success of our work against a goal of providing comforting and liberating experiences for hospital patients with limited mobility, psychological or pain-management problems.   The course proceeds from the assumption that the life experiences of the students, reinforced or modified by directed readings, can provide empathetic insight into visual, spatial and narrative elements that will prove positively reinforcing, uplifting and exciting to others, including those who might be facing significant medical challenges.  Through learning about the medium of immersive virtual reality (3D computer graphics viewed through a head mounted display) the course will address the limitations of this medium as well as its exciting possibilities. We will seek to understand the nature of virtual space, points of similarity and difference with everyday experience. Various themes and templates will be the basis of our projects, exploring design metaphors and seeking insight and connection with the imagined experience of our prospective users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration to juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Statement of Intent required; Permission of instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors sophomore and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GAINED IN TRANSLATION: COMICS AS ADAPTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Done well, respectful, original, and inventive adaptations can deliver fresh interpretations of original sources that are themselves new works of art that stand on their own merits. In this course, students will adapt written works from a variety of source materials into multi-page comics stories - demonstrating how form, narrative arc, cultural context, character, and emotion can be translated faithfully and artfully from one medium to another.  In the process of doing the work, students will master the language of comics, a medium with its own vernacular, using unique combinations of words and pictures to form meaning - and will gain insights into shared principles of story-telling that apply both to prose and to visual narrative.  After deep reading of the texts, to understand structure, story, and meaning, students will interpret and visually amplify the adapted texts, taking the new work from thumbnail, to full sketch, to final art, to self-published mini-comics. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WKSHP: FIGURE AND PERSPECTIVE INTENSIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This one-month workshop will be a practical exploration of perspective, both rules-based and optically determined, with an emphasis on its practical application in illustration, narrative, and concept art. The human figure both alone and in groups will be studied, as well as vehicles, architecture and landscapes. This course is emphatically not a diagrammatic treatment of perspective for architectural rendering, but rather a guide for getting it "right enough" and solving real-world representational challenges.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration during initial registration; open to Graphic Design and Industrial Design majors following initial registration period; open to other non-majors pending seat availability and permission of department. &lt;BR&gt; Students must register for workshops during the registration period and add/drop regardless of start date of class.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*PORTUGAL: MAPPING PORTUGAL: BIO-GEO CULTURAL HERITAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Located on the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal contains a wide range of socio-ecological regions and configurations, including large cityscapes, western and southern Atlantic coasts, mountainous regions, agricultural landscapes, marine ecologies, petrocultural landscapes, and tourist infrastructures.  In addition to these complexly-layered contemporary socio-ecologies, Portugal has many richly-layered built environments, with cultural heritage sites dating from the pre-historic to the contemporary.  Portugal's historical and contemporary socio-ecologies emerge from both historical and contemporary geopolitics, but also, at least in part, from its varied geological contexts.  Students in the co-requisite, integrated liberal arts and studio courses that comprise "Mapping Portugal: Bio-Geo-Cultural Heritages" will spend four weeks in Portugal and will use the methodologies of design for the built environment, the fine arts, the environmental humanities, mapping, and writing to investigate overlapping networks of biological, geological, and cultural heritage in Portugal, with a focus on the Alentejo and Algarve regions. The course begins and ends in Lisbon, but focuses primarily on sites to the south and east of Lisbon around four three different bases: Setubal/Sines/Alccer do Sal, vora, Mrtola /Serpa, and Faro.  By staying for extended periods in each of these areas, students will be able to focus their studies on the specific socio-ecologies and heritage sites surrounding each base.  By the course end, students will be able to link them together into a comprehensive understanding of the bio-geo-cultural heritages and networks of the Alentejo and Algarve.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for INTAR-1512 and LAEL-W512. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental &amp; Foundation Studies.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; 2019WS Estimated Travel Cost: $3,900.00 - airfare not included.  &lt;BR&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SUBTRACTIVE JEWELS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The creation of jewelry is typically thought of as an additive process; soldering, setting, forming to build upon existing shapes and designs. Often overlooked though are methods of making within jewelry that embody subtraction. The first pieces of jewelry were created using subtractive processes. This course introduces students to various subtractive processes that will challenge and develop their current hand fabrication skills in making; developing carving and engraving techniques in the context of jewelry. By engaging in these processes students can learn how removing material can inform design and concept. Lectures and research prompts will help students gain an understanding of how current contemporary artists use these methods and how they can apply this idea in their own work. Subtraction in jewelry requires complete attention and awareness of working with material. This course allows students to work in a more intimate and direct way, challenging individuals to engage in the simplification of design.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REPAIR: MAKING CONNECTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>To repair with the hands is a nurturing and healing act; it is to resist a disposable culture. Restoring what has been broken, fractured, or torn, is to give it purpose again. In conjunction with RISD Museum's exhibition, Repair and Design Futures, this workshop will investigate the processes of repair and connections through jewelry and metal techniques. In traditional jewelry-making, precision and accuracy is standard. We will begin with these standards then break the rules by embracing excess solder and scratched surfaces. Students will learn basic fine metals techniques in order to make connections between metal and found objects such as riveting and soldering, along with nontraditional connections such as sewing and wrapping. You will be encouraged to enhance cracks and tears in found or made objects through acts of repair, rather than concealing irregularities. We will study the idea of wabi-sabi, a Japanese concept centered on the transience and acceptance of imperfection. Together we will explore materiality through the ritual act of repair by making wearable adornment. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PATTERN MAKING PATTERNS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Patterns have an active role in our studio practice; this course will be an investigation into multiple meanings of this word. Drawing references from the natural or artificial world, we'll begin by focusing on pattern as designs and motifs. In doing so, students will learn about layout, piercing, and various ways of mark-making on metal. We'll then experiment with patterns as templates or prototypes that act as guides for creating dimension. Paper models and basic soldering, scoring, and forming techniques will be employed. Lastly, patterns in our habits and behavior are integral to a sustainable creative practice. What catches your eye? The use of mixed materials such as plastics, stones, beads, fabric or found objects will be encouraged in conjunction with metal as a way to denote content and language personal to you. Our goals will be to explore `pattern' as a way to understand the design process and gain insight into our personal artistic vocabulary all the while gaining a solid introduction to nonferrous metal fabrication skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/i&gt;), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt; ), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the relationship between narrative and national constructions in the literature and film produced by a variety of American authors during the 20th and 21st centuries. We will analyze texts from various authors in light of shifting paradigms in American thought, politics, and expressive culture.  Our primary investigation is twofold: (1) to understand pervasive themes in U.S. literature, including the in/commensurability of American democracy and its continued exclusionism, (2) to become conversant with theories of nationalism, sexuality, gender, race and class. As we pursue our inquiry, we will examine the historical, political, economic, and ideological factors that have created and shaped the narratives of Americans of different "backgrounds." </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like &lt;I&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt; Melancholia&lt;/I&gt; illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of &lt;I&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/I&gt; in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's &lt;I&gt;Shalimar the Clown&lt;/I&gt; or Bahman Ghobadi's &lt;I&gt;Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists&lt;/I&gt;, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's &lt;I&gt;The Submission&lt;/I&gt;, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's &lt;I&gt;Flight Behavior&lt;/I&gt;, Krakauer and Penn's &lt;I&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/I&gt;, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary &lt;I&gt;Gasland&lt;/I&gt;, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in &lt;I&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/I&gt;, and imaginary places in films like &lt;I&gt;After Life&lt;/I&gt; (Kore-eda Hirokazu), &lt;I&gt;Micmacs&lt;/I&gt; (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and &lt;I&gt;Marwencol&lt;/I&gt; (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REMAKING THE WORLD: ANGLO-AMERICAN MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the way in which dominant movements within Anglo-American modernist literature between 1890 and 1960 reflect artists' attempts to reimagine the world around them and humanity's place within it, including such stylistic developments as imagism and expressionism. The transformation of traditional genres and styles which characterizes the period is famously encapsulated by poet Ezra Pound's declaration that artists of all kinds must "Make It New." Focusing on both literal and figurative ex-patriot authors of the United States and United Kingdom, students can expect to read the novels and poetry of such authors as Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, David Jones, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf --authors whose writings exemplify some of the most radical experimentations of the modernist period.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMICS AND GRAPHIC LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING POETRY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Beginning Poetry Workshop is an elective course introducing students to the art of poetry writing. The course sequentially addresses major commitments of poetry including form/content, sound, line, voice, image, language(s), tradition/convention, experiment, audience, revision, performance, collection, publication, and distribution. Workshop is the heart of the course, animating the practice, discourse, critique, audience, community, and mentorship vital to poets. Every class will also include close reading, discussion of assigned texts, and writing. We will attend public readings, curate and participate in community readings, and welcome poets to our class, when possible. Work can be developed in a range of styles, traditions, and languages. You will leave this class with a collection of workshopped and revised poems, which you will design, self-publish, and distribute in print and/or digital form.  &lt;BR&gt;The Beginning Poetry Workshop is a prerequisite for the LAS-E421 Advanced Poetry Workshop in the Spring. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A workshop-style course which combines English with a studio project for students with an interest in children's picture books.  Students will learn to develop storytelling skills (imagination, language, plot, character, and voice) and illustration techniques (characterization, setting, page, layout) by studying picture books and completing writing and illustration assignments.  For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Students must plan and register for both LAS-E416 and ILLUS-3612 and will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the vast, variegated field of critical theory. We will study the concepts, questions, and debates that have been central to understandings of modern culture. In order to do so, we will explore key contributions in psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonial studies. As we explore this wide range of approaches, we will interrogate how thinkers have imagined and reimagined terms like "art," "reading," "subjectivity," "modern," "discipline," "culture," "power," "technology," "sovereignty" and "nature," among others. And as we build this critical lexicon, we will examine the social institutions and intellectual formations that shape each debate. What kinds of knowledge does critical theory produce, and what are their blindspots? What forms of personhood and community do these theories outline, and in whose interests? What kinds of insights become visible when we examine conflicting theories together? Thinkers include Adorno, Agamben, Althusser, Barthes, Benjamin, Benveniste, Bhabha, Butler, Chow, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Freud, Gramsci, Hall, Haraway, Irigaray, Jameson, Lacan, Latour, Levi-Strauss, Lukacs, Marx, Ranciere, Said, Saussure, Spivak, Terranova, Willliams, and others. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURES II: IRELAND, OCEANIA, AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Postcolonial literature is the writing produced by people in or from regions that have escaped the yoke of colonialism.  Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our readings will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Australia, India, Indonesia, Ireland, New Zealand, Samoa, and Sri Lanka.  This history of trading empires and settler colonies will be a major focus in this course.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them.  Writers may include Ciaran Carson, Lionel Fogarty, Keri Hulme, R.K. Narayan, Michael Ondaatje, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Albert Wendt.</COURSEDESC>

We will also study specific styles, phenomena, and movements, e.g., scat, silbo gomero, and hip hop, and students will be invited to present and work with examples from cultural and language traditions in which they are interested. Particular attention will be paid to contemporary practitioners, and to relationships between material traditions of poetry including sound, visual, and digital. Students will build knowledge of coordinated examples of sound poetry; compose and perform sound poems; and write and present a research paper. Texts may include Anne Carson, "The Gender of Sound," Jay-Z, Decoded, Christian Bk, Eunoia, Marjorie Perloff and Craig Dworkin's The Sound of Poetry/The Poetry of Sound, and the archive ubuweb.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LAS OPEN SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The LAS Open Seminar is devoted to the development of undergraduate and graduate degree projects that engage the discipline of literary arts and studies, and involves the writing of a longer, research-based project (thesis, artist's statement, creative work, etc). This engagement may take a variety of different forms, including a direct referencing or interaction with literary texts or issues; a focus on textuality and/or narrativity; a concern with research and the mechanics of writing a longer project. Therefore, as the course title indicates, the seminar has an open structure to accommodate our ability to address and foster each student's interests and concerns. As the semester progresses, we will move from a discussion of texts that introduce key concepts in the framing of interdisciplinary projects to group analyses and the workshopping of each student's project. In the first part of the semester, we will discuss a number of conceptual tenets that will ground our theorization of the artistic process, including issues of intentionality and audience; issues of translation and interdisciplinarity; and the relation of form to content. The second part of the semester will be organized and driven by group analyses of the degree and related written project of each class member. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors, seniors, 5th-years and graduate students.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or THAD. William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Also offered as THAD-C221; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROMANTIC TO EDWARDIAN BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley ("Transformation"), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (&lt;i&gt;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/i&gt;), Conrad ("The Secret Sharer"), and Lawrence.   &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will explore several of the rich literary traditions of the Middle East and North Africa in their artistic, political, and historical contexts.  Many of the traditions we will study take place under forced contact with European cultural and political institutions from the 19th century to the present.  For this reason, our inquiry will pay particular attention to topics such as tradition, colonialism, and gender politics in Algeria, Egypt, Palestine, and Lebanon.  Readings will include works by Assia Djebar, Mahmoud Darwish, Amin Maalouf, Naguib Mahfouz, and Ghassan Kanafani.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMICS AND GRAPHIC LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED POETRY WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Advanced Poetry Workshop is an intensive project-based poetry workshop for students with previous workshop experience and a portfolio of revised work on which to build. The course centers on workshop: peer critique by students with previous practice in poetry writing, and the shared goal of completing a semester-long publication/performance project. Students are expected to have a strong commitment to active participation in contemporary poetry as readers, writers, curators, performers, and audience. Teaching and learning methodologies include close reading of exemplary texts, experimentation with forms, revision, online/print publication, and performance. Texts will include poetry collections published in 2019 and 2020, as selected by students and instructor. The workshop welcomes work in any language and from any tradition of poetry. To the greatest extent possible, the work should speak for itself. But mediation, translation, contextualization also play a vital role.  &lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite: LAS-E411 Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop, or equivalent experience.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The advanced workshop assumes that students have some experience with writing fiction and are ready for an environment that will challenge them to hone, revise, and distill their craft. A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: LAS-E412: Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The word "liary" references the seven volumes of Anais Nin's diaries, which, upon their publication, were denounced by Nin's friends as utter fiction, as the "liary."  This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: NATURAL HISTORY: LOCAL, GLOBAL, ANALOG, DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar has two primary goals:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. To engage critically with natural history as a literary and visual art form and with its history as a scientific practice.  &lt;BR&gt; 2. To collaborate on projects and experiments that employ digital and analog methods for analyzing, interpreting, archiving, curating, and creating visual and literary works of natural history. Throughout the semester, we will visit local museums, labs, archives, and field sites to facilitate these goals.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Natural history is a crucial genre for understanding the origins of modern environmentalism, the history of science, discourses of race, and the nature of European imperialism. As an artistic and epistemological practice, natural history enjoyed the height of its popularity during the early modern and enlightenment periods, as European explorers, traders, and colonizers endeavored to classify, catalog, explain, and exploit the diverse flora and fauna all over the planet. In the process, they encountered (and often ignored or stole from) the complex folk biology of various indigenous cultures. Especially in the Americas, natural historical knowledge production depended on the collaboration of various cultures within profoundly uneven power dynamics: European explorers and creolized American naturalists, political leaders and ordinary citizens, amateur collectors and professional theorists, men and women, slaveholders and enslaved people, and Euro-colonial traders and indigenous Americans. Furthermore, early naturalists were polymaths --scientists, philosophers, political leaders, artists, writers, collectors, and traders --before the stratification of the modern sciences into disciplines that took place during the nineteenth century. As science became a more professional and specialized endeavor, natural history evolved into various forms of amateur field science, environmental art, and nature writing, an evolution this course will actively examine through reading, conversation, and practice. As such, our course materials will range from classical antiquity to the present and cover a large variety of written forms and artistic mediums.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS-C221; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;Br&gt; LAS-E101 is a prerequisite if taken for LAS credit. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL POETRY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Visual Poetry has been defined by Willard Bohn as "poetry that is meant to be seen." There are traditions of visual poetry in many cultures, ancient, modern, and contemporary, and because meaning is invested in pattern, color, dimension, texture, graphics, image, and animation as well as in the word, these poems can communicate whether or not you understand the language they are written in, and in many more ways than linear narrative. In a sense, visual poetry is language's own disappearing trick. This courses introduces students to cross-cultural traditions of visual poetry, including pattern poetry, illumination, concrete poetry, and what digital poet and theorist David Jhave Johnston calls TAVs (textaudio- visual poems) and TAVITs (text-audio-visual-interactive poems). Particular attention will be paid to contemporary practitioners, and to relationships between material traditions of poetry including sound, visual, and digital. Students will build knowledge; compose and publish visual poems; and write and present a research paper. Texts and references may include Dick Higgins, A Short History of Pattern Poetry, William Blake, Songs of Innocence &amp; of Experience, Adam Pendleton, Black Dada Reader, Crag Hill and Nico Vassilakis, The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008; works by Willard Bohn, Emmett Williams, Mary Ellen Solt, Johanna Drucker; and the archive ubuweb.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IRISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Ireland has a long history of literature, stretching from pre-Christian epics through monastic manuscripts right up to the thriving contemporary scene. While there are many important Irish writers before the beginning of the twentieth century, clearly the birth of the Abbey theatre and the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the prose of James Joyce created reverberations still felt in Ireland today. Using Joyce, Synge, and Yeats as a beginning point, in this seminar we will look at a series of contemporary Irish writers whose work builds upon the foundation established in the early years of the twentieth century. One of the themes we will return to again and again in this course is the theme of loss - loss of language, loss of sovereignty, loss of loved ones.  What does Stephen mean when he says, "History is a Nightmare from which I am trying to awake"?  Why is Yeats left in "the foul rag and bone shop of the heart"?</COURSEDESC>

What are some of the assumptions and desires that animate the relationship between theatre, performance, and politics? How has this relationship been practiced, understood and theorized over time, and most importantly, in contemporary circumstances? What relationship does political theatre have with the local, the national and the transnational? This course seeks to approach these questions through readings that may include works by Sophocles, Brecht, Heaney, Boal, Friel, Churchill, Edgar, Tendulkar, Soyinka, Fusco, Deavere Smith, Pinter and Nottage along with relevant theoretical texts. Screenings might include videos related to recent US presidential elections, musical and artistic performances, and acts of contemporary culture jamming activists like "The Yes Men."&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Taking its cue from Clint Eastwood who proclaimed, "As far as I'm concerned, Americans don't have any original art except Western movies and jazz," this course will analyze the Western film as an art form in and of itself. We will discuss Westerns in terms of their specific aesthetic and technological influence on the medium, their cultural expression of a national political unconscious, and their global function as the meta-narrative of space. This course will tackle these discussions through a chronological unfolding of the genre starting with the Edison Company's 1898 Westerns and Edwin S. Porter's &lt;i&gt;The Great Train Robbery (1903)&lt;/i&gt; through the Golden Age of John Ford and Howard Hawks' films and the reciprocal translation of Akira Kurosawa's epics, and finally, to the variants of the Spaghetti, Revisionist, and genre-bending contemporary and postmodern Westerns of Dennis Hopper, Sam Peckinpah, John Sayles, Jim Jarmusch, Ang Lee, and Wim Wenders. There will be required readings in critical film theory, weekly screenings, analytical essays, and oral presentations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRANSRACIAL BODIES, TRANSRACIAL SELVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thanks to the work and lives of transgender people, we now have room to understand our bodies in radically unbounded ways. Technological advances in surgery, hormonal therapy, psychiatry, cultural warfare, are catching up to the transgender presence: the gendered body is not necessarily that with which we were born, but one that can be crafted to match the real body of our psyche, our dreams. However, one's racial self remains tethered to biology. Blackness, Whiteness, Asianness, Latinness, the whole rainbow of racial identification, is still construed as biologically inescapable and inevitable. To speak of "transracialism" is to evoke self-delusion and community betrayal.  But this cultural reaction is contrary to the everyday experience that actually finds racial identification as a process that is always transracial: declaring ourselves racially, we all cross restricted zones in becoming ourselves.  In this course, we will use the discourse of transgenderism to build an alternate vocabulary of race. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL ENGLISHES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar attempts to do two things: first, we examine the global careers of the English language and the literatures written in it from their period of ascendance during the height of British colonialism in the late-19th century to their proliferation in the postcolonial present to argue for a concept of multiple "Englishes" in place of one dominant, normative, authentic 'English';second, we explore the hypothesis that the discourse of "Global Englishes" is not just constituted in writing and literature as most scholars have argued but also through everyday performance, and often through spoken forms. So, a discussion of the cultural politics of speaking and listening across different sonic media will supplement the regular study of selected fiction, nonfiction, plays, poetry, films, television, and music. Topics discussed will include variations in the uses of literary English, translations and adaptations, varieties of spoken Englishes, accents and code-switching, multilingualism in literary texts, etc. Historical and theoretical contexts will include colonialism and postcolonialism, economic and cultural globalization, identity politics, exile and migration, literary prizes, circulation and readership, etc. Not surprisingly, most of the authors we will read are from ex-colonies of the British Empire which now have thriving English language literary and cultural traditions of their own, like India and Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa, Canada and Australia, Ireland and the Caribbean region. Since the United Kingdom's and the United States' Englishes, even though dominant, are still part of 'the global' we will read some representative texts from Scotland or Wales, for instance, as well as "US ethnic literatures." Authors may include Rudyard Kipling, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, G V Desani, Salman Rushdie, J M Coetzee, Jean Rhys, Wole Soyinka, Michle Lalonde, Derek Walcott, Brian Friel, Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Mohsin Hamid, M. NourbeSe Philip, Irvine Welsh, Caroline Bergvall, and Junot Diaz. Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Professional actor/director Fred Sullivan (Trinity Repertory Company/Gamm Theatre/ Commonwealth Shakespeare resident artist and RISD Acting Workshop instructor) will guide a company of student actors, designers, stage managers through a workshop process of producing a live play for the stage, culminating in a two public performances of the production. Students in this course will be asked to: rehearse and perform assigned roles; accept assigned duties on graphic, projection and property/costume design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters and original work. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRUE CRIME</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Crime is terribly revealing," Agatha Christie wrote in her 1936 novel "The ABC Murders." In the genre known as "True Crime" - which, unlike Christie's novels, deals with real events -- there is a long and colorful history of examining crimes to see what, exactly, they reveal. This class is an introduction to this genre through classic texts (Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood", the Library of America's True Crime anthology), texts that challenge conventions (Rick Geary's graphic novel, "The Borden Tragedy"; Moises Kaufman's stage play, "The Laramie Project"), and texts that spill over in other media, including documentary film, television, radio, and photography.  Over the course of the term, students will not only become familiar with most famous crimes in American history -- recognizable by names like Manson and "O.J." -- but they will also explore the role crime plays in the history of a state that some call "Rogue's Island." Most importantly, the course is an opportunity for students to wrestle with the questions that the best True Crime stories pose. What is a crime? What is justice? And why are we perennially drawn to these stories?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN QUEER FILM, 1990-2018</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on the intersectionalities of race and queer subjectivities in queer cinema. We will trace this development from the historical cinematic 1990s of New Queer Cinema (NQC), an era that encompasses an explosion of "gay film visibility," to an exploration of present day queer cinema and the ways in which queer representations and queer identities are portrayed. We will study the stylistic developments and controversies of queer film, examining major innovations and changes as compared to films from the NQC era. Such questions as what's at stake in films that contest and re-imagine new queer subjectivities will be addressed during the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Visions of youthful utopia in Monterey Pop (1968) give way to violence and mayhem in Gimmie Shelter (Rolling Stones, 1970). Martin Scorsese offers an epilogue to an era in The Last Waltz (The Band, 1978). Madonna sells herself in Truth or Dare (1991) and Metallica undergoes group therapy in Some Kind of Monster (2004). Rock documentaries are as much about the social and political state of America as they are about music and musicians. In this course, we will explore the visual language and cultural history of the rockumentary film genre. Topics for discussion will include: documentary and cinema Veriti narrative forms; the troubled notion of documentary "truth"; music as commercial product; fandom and the cult of celebrity; and the rise of MTV. Students should be prepared to participate in class discussion, attend film screenings, complete critical readings, and hone their analytical writing skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this writing workshop, we will explore the short story form, working to put into words what we-as individual readers-hope to find in it. We will consider what makes a story a story, while acknowledging that it is often something ineffable, indefinable. We will read from a range of writers, including Alice Munro, Donald Barthelme, Roberto Bolao, and Vladimir Nabokov. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to writing exercises and peer workshops. At the end of the term, students will be expected to submit a portfolio comprised of informal reading responses, writing exercises, and completed stories.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will be looking at various displays of the human body, focusing on four main arenas: the freak show, the minstrel show, the drag show, and the human zoo. We will focus extensively on the 19th and early 20th centuries, the heyday of human exhibitions, and move forward to current modes of display, which both contest and refigure earlier spectacles. Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>

Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation, located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. More specifically, this course offers RISD students the opportunity to visit a biological hotspot and consider its role in society; participate in conservation science field research; interact cross-culturally; and develop their communication skills. Taught collaboratively, this course emphasizes the importance of connecting ideas, information, and methodologies across the arts, humanities, and sciences, with an emphasis on biology. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAS-W717 and SCI-W097. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration.

   <COURSETITLE>THE COOKBOOK: THE RHETORIC OF RECIPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The Cookbook: The Rhetoric of Recipes" is a course designed to look at the form and rhetoric of cookbooks. Cookbooks are their own distinct genre. There are rules that must be followed, though the range of possibilities are multitudinous. A cookbook entirely about bugs? Sure. A cookbook on gelatin desserts? In the 1960s there were dozens. But a cookbook ostensibly is both tantalizing and informative. It aims to make the reader want to eat the dish that it introduces, and it gives clear instruction about how to produce that dish. The course begins by looking medieval recipes, many of them found online at Cooking in the Archive. From there the course moves to looking at the culinary essays of Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynire and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the founders of culinary writing. Then we move to MFK Fisher and James Beard, before looking at Julia Child and Jacques Pepin and the rise of the celebrity chef. In the course students will be asked to deconstruct recipes. What makes a recipe successful? The rhetoric of cookbooks is an art, just as is poetry or memoir writing. Some cookbooks are literature, others are pulp. Over the course of five weeks, students will begin to learn how to create a recipe that both instructs and entices. They will learn how personality enters a cookbook, and how something like Marcus Samuelsson's The Soul of a New Cuisine is ultimately more about the writer than the recipes. By the course's end, each student will produce their own cookbook.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: WOMEN'S RESISTABCE ACROSS THE GLOBAL SOUTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores roles women have played in wars for independence and democracy across the Global South.  As the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo depicts in his iconic film, The Battle of Algiers (1966), some women fought alongside men carrying bombs in the fight for freedom from French imperialism in Algeria. However, more often, women have forged their own paths parallel to men enacting complex forms of resistance through art, mobilizing domesticity, and protest. Using women's participation in Algerian independence in the 1950s as our starting point, we will engage with women who resist the reductive fantasy of the bomb-carrying female freedom fighter throughout world. Figures under our investigative lens will include Assia Djebar who illustrates women playing new roles outside of the home in Algeria; women who led the peacemaking process in Liberia to bring Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to power; and Lina Ben Mhenni who used social media in Tunisia to show the world injustice taking place under a repressive regime in 2010. Alongside these memoirs, literary texts, historical documents, and films by and about women at war, we will develop a critical vocabulary of women at work reading theorists that include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler. Over the course of the semester, we will put these voices in conversation with one another in order to reconstruct alternative histories of resisting oppression in the Global South and beyond.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMA AND NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have shaped contemporary media and culture in profound ways, including how we make, experience, and talk about art, design, commerce, and culture, bodies, identities, and communities, privacy, security, and war, time, space, and geography, and even the politics of meaning and "truth" themselves. In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ITALY: SEE NAPLES AND DIE: PANORAMA AND THE POETICS OF A CITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Vedi Napoli e poi muori ("See Naples and then die") was a common expression, echoed most famously on his grand tour by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, to identify Naples as the most naturally and artistically beautiful city in the world; so beautiful that one needn't look upon anything else after seeing it. Few cities embody the Empedoclean elementality of Naples: situated in a volcanic landscape dominated by Mount Vesuvius, beside an enormous bay and natural harbor that opens onto the Tyrrhenian Sea under an endless sky, it marks a dramatic convergence of earth, wind, water and fire.  The art, literature, history, politics and economics of Naples are equally "elemental" in the way that their constitutive and conflicting cultural forces are manifest in a dynamic, frequently paradoxical system of social relations.   &lt;br&gt; Students will engage this compelling city and its environment through the twinned graphic practices of drawing and writing, with particular attention given to the mediums of panoramic landscape, scientific illustration, philosophical speculation and fictional narrative.  The LAS component of the course will survey literary discourses from antiquity to the present that imagine Naples and its environment.  Readings (in English translation) will consist of selections by Virgil, Pliny (Elder and Younger), Livy, Tomasso Campanella, Giambattista Vico, Giacomo Leopardi, Matilde Serao and Walter Benjamin.  The primary texts around which the course will be built are Susan Sontag's Volcano Lover, Roberto Saviano's Gomorrah, and contemporary Neapolitan noir fiction.  Students will have read and written on Volcano Lover before convening in Naples, after which work will commence on a term project produced in tandem with travel and studio projects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAS-W725 and LDAR-W625.

   <COURSETITLE>*PORTUGAL: MAPPING PORTUGAL: BIO-GEO CULTURAL HERITAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Located on the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal contains a wide range of socio-ecological regions and configurations, including large cityscapes, western and southern Atlantic coasts, mountainous regions, agricultural landscapes, marine ecologies, petrocultural landscapes, and tourist infrastructures.  In addition to these complexly-layered contemporary socio-ecologies, Portugal has many richly-layered built environments, with cultural heritage sites dating from the pre-historic to the contemporary.  Portugal's historical and contemporary socio-ecologies emerge from both historical and contemporary geopolitics, but also, at least in part, from its varied geological contexts.  Students in the co-requisite, integrated liberal arts and studio courses that comprise "Mapping Portugal: Bio-Geo-Cultural Heritages" will spend four weeks in Portugal and will use the methodologies of design for the built environment, the fine arts, the environmental humanities, mapping, and writing to investigate overlapping networks of biological, geological, and cultural heritage in Portugal, with a focus on the Alentejo and Algarve regions. The course begins and ends in Lisbon, but focuses primarily on sites to the south and east of Lisbon around four three different bases: Setubal/Sines/Alccer do Sal, vora, Mrtola /Serpa, and Faro.  By staying for extended periods in each of these areas, students will be able to focus their studies on the specific socio-ecologies and heritage sites surrounding each base.  By the course end, students will be able to link them together into a comprehensive understanding of the bio-geo-cultural heritages and networks of the Alentejo and Algarve.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAEL-W512 and INTAR-1512. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;BR&gt;Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.

   <COURSEDESC>What is political about theatre and performance and when does politics become theatrical? What are some of the assumptions and desires that animate the relationship between theatre, performance, and politics? How has this relationship been practiced, understood and theorized over time, and most importantly, in contemporary circumstances? What relationship does political theatre have with the local, the national and the transnational? This course seeks to approach these questions through readings that may include works by Sophocles, Brecht, Heaney, Boal, Friel, Churchill, Edgar, Tendulkar, Soyinka, Fusco, Deavere Smith, Pinter and Nottage along with relevant theoretical texts. Screenings might include videos related to recent US presidential elections, musical and artistic performances, and acts of contemporary culture jamming activists like "The Yes Men."&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINESE CINEMA: QUESTIONS OF NATIONALISM, REALISM, AND FILM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore Chinese Cinema as a national cinema and as a transnational cinema in both its popular and classic forms; however, the term 'Chinese' has been and is still a debated term among the very populations that lay claim to it, i.e., mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chinese diaspora, the People's Republic. These debates make the study of Chinese film a study of how to categorize or know film itself. In other words, exploring Chinese film in a Western critical arena within the hegemony of Western film studies begs theoretical questions about the very dominant and commonplace terms and perspectives used to examine all film in the 21st century, i.e, What are these films showing us?  What are we looking for?  What do we see?  Investigating these theoretical quandaries will also be a part of this course.  We will survey representative films produced before 1949, during the shift from of the cultural capital from Yan'an to Shanghai 1950-1964, during the Cultural Revolution (1964-1986), and during its emergence as the premier transnational cinema (late-1980s to 2000s).  We will also consider the particular film genres and film schools of Chinese cinema. Students will be responsible for reading critical and theoretical essays, viewing all required films, writing analytical papers on assigned topics, and presenting one oral sequence analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POND STREET PROJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Pond Street Project course will focus on the development of a community-based historic site investigation in the city of Providence that contemplates two phases: 1) programs of community-engaged research that support the build-out of a web archive of historic primary source material, and 2) art and storytelling programs that use the Pond Street archive to make choices about what stories are important to share (to return to the community memory) and how they can be shared (permanent or ephemeral, oral or visual, virtual or concrete). The course will introduce students to the neighborhood and its history. Students will be invited to develop and design research and archival programs that respond to questions about community, diversity, access, inclusion, and connection. Students will be introduced to the landscape of community organizations and institutions that might participate in these programs. Students will also engage in their own research project using scholarly best practices to build a mini-archive around a specific individual or individuals, institution or institutions, or which respond to specific questions of race, diversity, immigration, ethnicity, and class using the project site as a primary lens of examination. Students will engage in readings of history and historiography that question the shaping of history and history-telling, the role of power and authority in the construction of history, and current questions about tourism, consumerism, development and gentrification, and community in contemporary history-telling. The outcomes of the coursework will emphasize the development of understanding and skill in scholarly historical research, narrative design, and the history and historiography of placemaking.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FAMILY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of &lt;I&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/I&gt; reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: BLACK WOMEN RUIN EVERYTHING: SLAVES, ALIENS AND GHOSTS IN PURSUIT OF A BETTER WORLD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is grounded in two premises. The first is that the world is founded on anti-blackness and the second is that black feminist authors write with an awareness of this fact and the desire to imagine this world otherwise. Focusing on works of speculative fiction such as Octavia Butler's Dawn and Toni Morrison's Beloved, as well as less easily classifiable texts such as Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters and Phyllis Alesia Perry's Stigmata, this course considers how the use of non-realist elements in realist (protest fiction and neo-slave narratives) and non-realist (such as afro-futurism) genres serve as important means of both critiquing the gendered anti-blackness that affects black women's life chances and imagining a future not predicated on simply enrolling black being in the existing hierarchies of human being. Put otherwise, this course will investigate how black feminist writers have used speculative fiction and/or elements of speculative fiction to attempt to image not only their own freedom but also the freedom of all beings arranged within the social and political hierarchies built upon their backs.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Literature is one facet of culture.  The significance of literature can be best understood in terms of the culture for which it springs, and the purpose is clear only when the reader understands and accepts the assumptions on which literature is based" (Paula Gunn Allen-Laguna Sioux poet). This course will explore value systems and aesthetics that are from very diverse Native cultures, focusing on the ways in which indigenousness relates to literature and storytelling. The critical methodologies developed by Native critics such as Gerald Vizenor  (Anishinaabe writer and scholar), and Craig Womack (Muscogee Creek-Cherokee author and professor of Native Studies) will enable us to study Native frameworks and new ways to regard literature/histories. We will explore questions such as can Native American theory/literature transform or challenge non-Native critical theoretical strategies. Our discussions, which may take a variety of directions, will also examine such issues as American Indian identities and communities as well as the impact of colonization on tribal peoples.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE: ALIENS IN SCIENCE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There are few things that represent the non-human better than the alien. Not of this world, often not even humanoid, the alien serves as the ultimate Other-something that does not belong, something that is different in a fundamental way, something that is often unknowable, something completely and utterly foreign. Gary Westfahl writes that "aliens are both metaphors and real possibilities" (16). As fundamentally non-human, though sometimes humanoid, the alien acts as a mirror to humanity, showing us the best, though more often, the worst of our own impulses. Aliens can be used to look inward, to probe the nature of humanity and thereby illustrate and comment upon human impulses, morals, and values. However, the ubiquity of aliens across media demonstrate that "humans also crave companionship in a vast, cold universe and aliens may represent hopeful, compensatory images of the strange friends we have been unable to find" (Westfahl 16). Symbolically, this plays out in a number of ways. The alien might represent an Other based on gender, sexuality, or race. The alien might be friendly, here to help mankind, opportunistic, here to plunder our natural resources, or downright evil, bent on eating, incubating in, or wiping out our civilization. This class will examine a number of Science Fiction works that feature aliens, from Octavia Butler, H.G. Wells, and C.J. Cherryh, to films by Ridley Scott, Steven Speilberg, and Neill Blomkamp. We will also draw on a number of theoretical authors, from Barbara Creed and Julia Kristeva, to Gary Westfahl and Darko Suvin.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL LITERARY MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the last decades, modernist studies has moved far beyond its initial focus on a group of male Anglo-American High Modernists writing between 1890 and 1940. What the field now refers to as modernisms encompass popular and elite forms alike, some emphasizing stylistic form and others not, authored by men and women of diverse racial and national identities, class backgrounds, and political affiliations. Like modernity, which modernism is generally seen to respond to, modernism viewed on a global scale has appeared unevenly and irregularly across time and geographic space and thus defies periodization. This course will survey global literary modernisms from a comparative perspective, attending to how the notions of the world and the modern are engaged in texts by such authors as Charles Baudelaire (France), Joseph Conrad (England), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Anna Akhmatova (Russia), Constantine Cavafy (Greece), Rabindranath Tagore (India), Jean Rhys (Dominican Rep.), Nella Larsen (U.S.), Jorge Luiz Borges (Argentina), Aim Cesar (Martinique), Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar (Turkey), Eileen Chang (China), and others.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMA AND NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have shaped contemporary media and culture in profound ways, including how we make, experience, and talk about art, design, commerce, and culture, bodies, identities, and communities, privacy, security, and war, time, space, and geography, and even the politics of meaning and "truth" themselves. In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Landscape is a term that can refer to a specific locale, design, or a collection of ideas. The term usually implies a system of interrelated cultural and natural forces operating within a context of a defined scale or disciplinary boundaries.  In this course we examine and discuss the foundational definitions of the term landscape and the theoretical stances that are active in the creation of contemporary landscape architecture, land art and other creative disciplines. Writing assignments will be based upon fundamental texts, direct experience, and contemporary projects. Weekly readings will be discussed and diagrammed in class for content and structure. Students will produce a series of  five short (2 to 3 page) analytical essays and case studies. There will be weekly discussion sections with course TAs to review readings, two field assignments, and one field trip to the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design  Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Open to qualified undergraduates and non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Rhino will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;br&gt;Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do these words mean and what is their relationship to each other in the architectural design disciplines? Each word is packed with complex and evolving meanings that reflect the state of human knowledge about the environments in which we live and in which we intervene. Each word reflects our understanding of systems, physical, cultural and social, biotic and abiotic, as well as our aspirations to conserve, restore, or reshape those systems. Each word is ubiquitous in the contemporary quest to construct a sustainable, resilient future.  But do we really understand what they mean? Are they critically interdependent or can they be considered separately?&lt;br&gt; This studio will examine these questions with the twin objectives of establishing an evolving and dynamic understanding of the terms and generating working methods that respond to the complexities of scale encountered in the landscape.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This final core studio stresses large-scale and planning issues, complex sites, and urban conditions. The city is a living organism which evolves in a particular locale with a particular form due to a combination of environmental and cultural factors. These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux.

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since it's creation over 100 years ago, landscape architecture has expanded beyond horticultural preoccupations to a discipline that engages natural, political and cultural systems to build ecological and social resilience.  This professional practice seminar explores contemporary practices of landscape architecture through the exploration of six current trends in practice: operating, researching, engaging, constructing, programming, and sustaining.  These topics are explored and discussed through student research initiatives, in-class lectures, readings, case study presentations from a wide range of practitioners, office visits, and site visits.  The goal of the course is to expose students to the variety of ways to practice landscape architecture today.  Students are encouraged to ask questions, bring their own experiences to class, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.  &lt;br&gt; Please see 2014 class blog for student content and writing samples: http://principlesofpractice2014.tumblr.com&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design  Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing. This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGINATION CRAFTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"It was once an imagination, but now a rhythmic space to physically explore the inner mental world." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In China, people appreciate a landscape painting through imagined interactions - they appreciate through immersing themselves into a world that exists in their mind or imagination. The course wants to explore this process, using narrative strategy to transform the imagination into physical space. You can use this chance to turn a dream, a childhood memory or a novel chapter into physical space, it can be private or sharable. By exploring crafting strategies during the interpretation process, students can appreciate the spatial sequence, body movement and engagement of all the senses they create bit by bit. The course includes two phases. In phase one, students need to use crafting methods, 3D models, 2D drawings, and readings to explore the spatial sequence of four typical traditional Chinese gardens. Students will understand the process of narrative landscape design. Lectures will introduce five spatial typologies commonly used in traditional Chinese garden and how they serve as the methodology of spatial sequence design. &lt;br&gt; Student will conduct their own space sequence design based on imagination in phase two. Students are asked to propose their story and work individually. Student need to use different crafting skills to build a 3D space translating from original imagination. We encourage them to think carefully about how their space sequence leads to body movement. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $80.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SITE | ECOLOGY | DESIGN STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What do these words mean and what is their relationship to each other in the architectural design disciplines? Each word is packed with complex and evolving meanings that reflect the state of human knowledge about the environments in which we live and in which we intervene. Each word reflects our understanding of systems, physical, cultural and social, biotic and abiotic, as well as our aspirations to conserve, restore, or reshape those systems. Each word is ubiquitous in the contemporary quest to construct a sustainable, resilient future.  But do we really understand what they mean? Are they critically interdependent or can they be considered separately?&lt;br&gt; This studio will examine these questions with the twin objectives of establishing an evolving and dynamic understanding of the terms and generating working methods that respond to the complexities of scale encountered in the landscape.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIES OF NATURECULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to important authors, texts, topics, theories, and conversations in the environmental humanities. Students will carefully read and discuss a range of theoretical texts centered on questions of nature and the environment. Readings are likely to include eco-phenomenologies, thing theories, critical animal studies, slow violence, queer ecologies, and the geological turn, among other topics. The activity of close engagement with theoretical material will enable students to consider how texts encourage particular forms of comprehension and interaction with the environment, and to interrogate the intellectual and material consequences that accrue from particular ways of conceptualizing natureculture. As a required course in the first semester of the NCSS MA degree, the course creates a common vocabulary and experience for all NCSS MA students. The course can also be taken as a stand-alone seminar by non-major graduate students. Run as a seminar, students will engage in weekly discussions of course readings and complete regular writing assignments.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all graduate level students. &lt;BR&gt; For students enrolled in the MA in NCSS, NCSS-700G and NCSS-701G are co-requisites. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to important contemporary case studies and pressing global scenarios in the interdisciplinary field of nature-culture-sustainability studies.  Readings examine varied configurations of land, people, environment, animals, and climate across nations and cultures. Each week of the course engages with issues of difference and diversity. The course will be of interest to those researching forms of capitalism, economic and social inequality, gender relations, identity politics, human-animal studies, ethics, and political struggle in relationship to land, territory, environment, and urbanism. NCSS-702G expands, extends, and resituates the foundational theoretical texts studied in NCSS-700G by asking students to read authors who have applied the work of NCSS-700G authors as lenses for engaging and understanding issues of global importance. As a required course in the first semester of the NCSS MA degree, the course creates a common vocabulary and experience for all NCSS MA students. The course can also be taken as a stand - alone seminar by non-major graduate students. Run as a seminar, students will complete weekly readings, regular writing assignments, and will engage weekly in class discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to all graduate level students. &lt;br&gt; For students enrolled in the MA in NCSS, NCSS-702G and NCSS-703G are co-requisites. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will complete case-study-based independent research and writing related to the discussions, topics, readings, and other activities from NCSS-702G.  NCSS-703G, together with NCSS-700G, NCSS 701G, and NCSS-702G, provides students an opportunity to explore and experiment with NCSS contexts, scholarly and professional, in and beyond RISD, within which that they might want to situate themselves.  This course introduces students to important conversations in art and design-based NCSS practices.  Through regular writing assignments, class discussion, and independent research, students are offered a guided opportunity to think critically about their own research interests and the professional spaces or career paths they might want to engage.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Restricted to students enrolled in the NCSS MA. &lt;BR&gt;For students enrolled in the MA in NCSS, NCSS-702G and NCSS-703G are co-requisites.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;         </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIFE IN COMMON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There has been an explosion of interest in the commons on the part of scholars, activists, and policymakers. This interdisciplinary seminar examines the politics and critical geographies of commons and commoning. The seminar provides an introduction to theories of commons and commoning, with a focus on the role of the commons in fostering other-than-capitalist ways of being and relating to the more-than-human world. We will study a range of social and environmental movements engaged with questioning and reimagining how we share resources, live and work in common, and build more meaningful worlds. We will explore aesthetic practices, community economies, and collective environmental care, in order to ask: What possibilities do commons hold for new forms of world-making?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to graduate students only. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PETROCULTURES: UTOPIA AND APOCALYPSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to ways of thinking, visualizing, and critiquing global petrocultures. From the fabric of our daily lives to the workings of contemporary geopolitics, our world is fueled by oil. Yet how does oil shape our understanding of the world? In this seminar we will consider oil across geographic and temporal contexts, not only as a material substance but also as an ideologically loaded principle. We will examine the ways a petroculture is created and naturalized through a series of discussions grounded in the various visual, spatial, and material manifestations of petroleum. Case studies of such manifestations will encompass but not be limited to the visual arts, architecture, cinema, and literature, and they will be placed in conversation with a range of texts that both defend and critique petrocultures and their consequences: historical narratives, first-person accounts, corporate propaganda, and theoretical analyses. Students will be expected to participate in class discussion, complete weekly reading and writing assignments, and contribute in-class presentations. From political economy to ecological activism, from automobile culture to urban planning, from the invention of plastics to the rise of sustainable alternatives, we will ask ourselves, just what is a petroculture? What forms does it take? And is there life after oil? &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to graduate students only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR HONORS INTERDISCIPLINARY CRITIQUE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course in which first-semester seniors who have already demonstrated unusual commitment, ambition and initiative within their majors will pursue and discuss independent work in a setting that reflects, as closely as possible, the interdisciplinary conversation that actually takes place around advanced art practice today. The course is intended to allow those working within medium-specific vocabularies to test how their work will make meaning in an art world in which a variety of disciplinary histories and conventions coexist, clash, and inform one another, as well as to provide an opportunity for students whose work bridges two or more disciplines (or involves performance/new genres/post-studio approaches) to learn from one another and from faculty capable of addressing all of these sorts of practices. This is a demanding critique course with additional seminar components (readings, screenings, discussions, slide presentations, etc.), and as such students can expect a workload equivalent to a core studio requirement within their major. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Acceptance into the course will be based on a GPA of 3.25 or greater as well as the recommendation of faculty and department heads from the student's major and on review of previous work. Candidates will be identified in discussions between the instructor and department heads during the preceding spring semester. Successful completion of THAD-H490/PAINT-4507 (Contemporary Art &amp; its Discourses) or equivalent coursework is a prerequisite, ensuring students have a shared understanding of the art historical context for interdisciplinary. The maximum enrollment is limited to seminar-size (c. 15 students) in order to provide sufficient attention to each student's work in group and individual critiques while still allowing for seminar-style discussions &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at the academy, the institution and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices and their cultural frameworks from the 1990s to the present. Frequent studio visits will occur and drive some of the reading and discussion. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective &lt;br&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING REFOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide variety of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting - but not its most traditional conventions. Encouraging idiosyncratic, individualistic art making with a heightened attention to the tactile nature of materials students will explore visual culture through informed readings and targeted artists. "Art supplies" will come from Home Depot and recycling as much as Utrecht and Blick. Employing the recycled, the found and gathered, the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning. Assignments will be introduced through the screening of classic Sci-Fi films that will act as a prompt for each project.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective; open to all majors.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY PREHISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, required for painting majors in spring semester of sophomore year, describes five defining features of modernity, providing the broad historical backdrop for their "invention": the individual, globalization, nature, industrialization, and abstraction. The first half of the class will be devoted to the visual art of varied geographic and cultural settings prior to and during the rise of these paradigms. The second half of the class slows to focus in greater detail on the high modernist manifestations of each of those themes (interiority, capital, environment, technology, and narrative), and uses them to contextualize the art and culture of the 20th century. Periods, places, and subjects will be introduced through secondary sources, providing a critical lens through which to connect the material to present day art, culture, politics, and experience (for instance, the rise of global trade will be seen through the lens of postcolonial theory). The material for the course ends at approximately 1989, setting the stage for a more in-depth look at contemporary art, culture, and criticism in their junior year course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore major requirement; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be designed to develop confidence and experience with paint and painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques. No prior painting experience is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FROM OBSERVATION MARATHON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Painting from Observation will be a team taught Schedule A and B marathon for 6 credits.  Drawing, collage, printmaking and painting will introduce students to contemporary painting as practised by the RISD Painting Department.&lt;BR&gt;   This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It is designed to develop confidence and experience with paint and painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as in direct processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques. No prior painting experience is required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is based on Hornung's textbook, Colour: a workshop for artists and designers. Under the guidance of the instructor, students produce a series of small painted collages that examine color from a variety of approaches. The goal is to master color principles and make them applicable to studio practice.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $110.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND: INTERPLAY BETWEEN SURFACE AND IMAGERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the majority of drawing takes place on mass-produced, white paper, the surface on which a drawing is created is an important aspect of a drawing's composition and meaning.  Color, texture, and materials of both surface and imagery all contribute to the final image. This course will focus on creating paper grounds as an integral part of the final composition. These grounds may even come to the forefront, evolving into distinct pieces that exist on their own.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This class will be split into two phases:  The first half of the class will be dedicated to the creation of paper grounds.  Students will explore the process of making paper from start to finish. In the creation of sheets, students will learn coloring, painting, and pouring with pulp.  Each sheet will become a unique composition, an original background or foreground.  During the second half of the class, students will explore making drawings on their individual grounds.  The relationship between imagery and surface will be consciously explored in order to develop multiple layers of meaning.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRIMARY SOURCES ILLUMINATING THE OCEAN DEEP AT THE NEW BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MONSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate cultural traditions of the "monster", broadly defined as an entity of horrific other-ness. Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MILLENNIAL PINK: THE 21ST CENTURY PORTRAIT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The dictionary defines "portrait" as "a painting, drawing, photograph, or engraving of a person, especially one depicting only the face or head and shoulders." In the 21st century, technology has extended portraiture beyond analog methods for the depiction of physical appearance into digital methods for shedding light on the subject's identity, likes/dislikes, and interests. Take for example how journalists, researchers, and fashion designers have used a certain shade of pink-"millennial pink"-to describe a generation. This pink was popularized by commercial interests, (e.g., Pantone naming it "color of the year" for 2016, or its appropriation by lifestyle bloggers and journalists as a way to portray millennials as a generation of androgyny, and one in which women reclaim femininity) in order to sell pink-colored products to all types of women as well as to men. Self-quantitative data, analysis of online communications with other users, social media "likes," and avatars (virtual alter egos) are all technologies for portraying people that do not necessarily center on those people's physical appearances. Through this course, we will explore how digital tools, such as data collection and digital collage, can be used alongside analog methods, such as drawing and painting, to create portraits of oneself and others. We will look at artists from Sascha Braunig, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Richard Prince, to Amalia Ulman and Kim Kardashian.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the end of the course, students will have explored various digital approaches to portraiture, such as the free Snapchat program, Lens Studio, and other social media platforms, in order to develop their own unique perspectives on, and practices of, portrait painting in subversion of the commercial intention of these platforms. While each painting and drawing assignment will focus on specific course-related topics, students will be encouraged to think about how these ideas and topics relate to and influence their work outside of the course. Studio assignments will be completed through digital and analog collage, computer and smartphone applications, drawing, and painting; and will be accompanied by short reading assignments and discussions, class lectures, critiques, and visits to the RISD Museum and Co-Works.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERCEPTUAL PLACE: REIMAGINING TODAY'S LANDSCAPE IN PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The landscape as a genre was largely defined throughout Western art history as "pictures of the countryside," but the word "landscape's" multitiered definition reaches beyond what could be depicted. After substantial rethinking prior to and during early modernism, the subject has seemed to decline in popularity. With traditional schools of thought and regionalist painting having become things of the past, the idea of landscape painting calls for updating to suit the times. This class will challenge students to engage the idea of the landscape from various perspectives such as the natural, social, political, and digital landscape, among other things. The goal of the class is to focus on visualizing and communicating a sense of place within the multifaceted world we navigate today. &lt;bR&gt; Students will take on the task through a series of drawings, a collage assignment, and midterm and final painting project. Though the first 3 projects are assignment based, the final will allow students to propose and develop their own ideas from scratch. The class will emphasize an attention to notions of space, composition and materiality as they relate to the terms and conditions of today. A variety of approaches are encouraged, provided they relate to the language of painting. Weekly readings will be distributed and in-class discussions will help contextualize the themes. We will look at modern and contemporary artists working with the landscape, and use their work to locate key points of discourse. &lt;bR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $175.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How does queer theory impact the ways we look at painting, and how have painters been informed by queer theory? Is there such a thing as queer painting? In this studio course, students will create works in response to and in conversation with assigned queer theoretical texts. Readings will include work by Judith Halberstam, David Getsy, Samuel Delaney, Audre Lorde, Eve Sedgwick, Guy Hocquenghem, Judith Butler, David Wojnarowicz and more. Class time will be divided between studio and class discussions, and we will have guest speakers join us for discussion.  Artists and collectives we will look at include: David Wojnarowicz, Mickalene Thomas, Amy Sillman, Nicole Eisenman, Group Material, Celeste Dupuy-Spencer, Carrie Moyer, Marsden Hartley, David Hockney and more. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RAINBOW GLOW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Sunlight looks white; it's not the absence of color but the sum of all visible wavelengths. Rain droplets are suspended liquid prisms. "White light" enters a prism and is bent by refraction. Different wavelengths of light bend at different angles and white light separates into violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red creating a rainbow. Color is, in a certain sense, an illusion, and our experience of it is subjective. Our brains convert a certain range of the electromagnetic spectrum into what we call color. We can measure the wavelength of radiation but we can't measure the experience of a color inside the mind. Physics hasn't achieved a way of knowing whether one person's red is the same as another's. In this class we will explore individual perceptions of color. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Our exploration begins with the separation of white light into its constituent parts. Students will progressively discover how perceptions of color are altered by compositional interactions and lighting. The class consists of observational oil painting sessions in which the lighting of a set up and model are controlled to focus on one of the colors that makes up "white light." For example, in the first session the model-set up will be lit entirely by violet bulbs. After this violet-lit session students will be expected to make a still life focusing on different tonal values of indigo. The class will progress through the spectrum with analysis, criticism, group discussion, and critiques, in addition to looking at traditional and contemporary painters that make exciting use of color. This is not a course about mastering the traditional approaches to understanding the operations of color. Rather, this studio course is about allocating a month to exploring color interactions and paying deeper attention to the variations that exist even within monochrome scenarios. Physics readings will prove that color is determined by the observer's eye and the artists we discuss will show how rich color observation and application can become, encouraging the student to make thoughtful and deliberate color choices within and beyond the class. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;/br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a hands-on course, designed for advanced painting students who are fascinated by color, surface, transformation and alchemy, DIY processes, craftmanship, invention, and the stuff of paint. It is for those who are eager to dive deep into all sorts of materials, methods and techniques.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The objective of the class is to arm students with the tools and resources to figure out how to make what they imagine and to expand their practice through material exploration and information sharing. With an emphasis on experimentation, play, research and development; advanced students explore, problem solve and implement specific grounds, paints, supports, mediums and tools into their own practices.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The level of specialization and expertise students may eventually desire for their work could require seeking the advice of paint manufacturers, conservators, fabricators, other artists or even experts in other fields.  How to identify and acquire knowledge outside of one's comfort zone, approaching and finding a common terminology with peers and specialists is also a part of this course. Relevant art historical and contemporary methodologies, techniques and materials will be presented. Environmental Health and Safety guidelines that apply to painting practice and painting studio safety will be an integral part of this course. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GROUP MATERIAL:TACTICS IN COLLABORATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Collaboration, by its very nature, confronts the mythos of the isolated artist. It disrupts individualism with collectivity, fractures myopia with context, and challenges expression with exchange.  Through studio work, research and critique, we will build nuanced positions around notions of collaboration: utilizing tactics of the collaborative, collective and plural. We will explore ideas of shared labor, self-organization, collective production, outsourcing, call &amp; response, appropriation, anti-hermeticism, performativity, community engagement, nomadism, and participation. We will unpack these notions in seemingly contradictory ways, as both methods of creativity and as strategies for critical reflection. Our research will cover a history of collaborative projects with screenings, readings, lectures and student led presentations. To survey our research: we will start with Oscar Wilde's opera with Richard Strauss Salome, onto Dada, the Futurists, films of Jack Smith and his work with Warhol, Carolee Schneemann's works with James Tenney and Yvonne Rainer  to more contemporary projects such as Hope Ginsburg, Stephanie Syjuco Harun Farocki and Adelita Husni-Bey.   We will observe and analyze performative works of installation, performance, film, painting and expanded fields to build a broaden understanding of what collaborations means today. (There is an extensive list of artists we will pool in our discussions, lectures, research projects and screenings included in the weekly syllabus)   Our analysis will start with the intimate &amp; subjective material of collaborative works panning out to the cultural conditions that provoke, necessitate and reside within such efforts. We will unpack how those bodies of work either support or challenge what we come to understand as collaboration.   Culminating in two stages, our studio work will take two forms. First a two-person collaborative work to be completed for midterm reviews.  Lastly final collaborative projects to be presented in a group exhibition at semester's end. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective; open to all majors junior and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The work intensive studio course will involved students in an intense visual, aesthetic and theoretical discussion around the historical relationship of Cinema to Painting and Arts Culture in general and move on to the analyze the current embodiment of Cinema's more conflated and confounded, co-dependant relationship to the Art's of today, tapping into the cross-pollination resulting of imagery, politics and theory's as they apply. Each class meeting will involve studio work and discussion and culminate with a film screening. The film screenings will move forward from Cinema's very beginnings to a few of today's best Indie films. The concentration of the course will be assigned painting projects that will be direct responses to the films being screened and related critiques of these projects as they pertain to the films and the applicable supplemental literature, allowing the discussion around Cinema, cinematic and art critical theory and the Art culture to be transferred to the students individual works thus allowing for the work to be seen in a larger context.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making. We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them. We'll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers. Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.) Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

We will investigate the collection, curation, indexation and juxtaposition of visual images from a wider range of sources.  We will consider how new personal, social and political meanings can be generated from different materials; this will be framed by critically reviewing the work of contemporary artists who use different modes and methods of collecting in their practice.  We will explore the ways in which images, objects, documents and traces inform history, testimony and identity.  Through this course, students will create a personalized depository of images from which to draw for future art and design projects.  Examining rules and processes for collecting; how such rules can be bent or broken; and how collections of images are interpreted and understood is a core thematic.  Class time will include lectures, screenings, debates, creative thinking activities, critique and presentations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Fee for non-majors: $35.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Over the past decade, photography books have seen a resurgence within the art world, this time transcending their original use as survey or catalog to become ideal spaces and platforms to experience and disseminate work.  Today image-based printed matter functions in a multitude of ways, all of which at their core are driven by the mechanics of sequence and editing. Through class discussions, using RISD's Fleet Library and Special Collections, and individual research - students will form a personal vision of what images mean in the book form. Our focus will be equally on content, concept, production &amp; technique. The semester will culminate in each student having devised, sequenced, edited and produced a fully resolved and realized photography book. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Not only can it be a still print-object, but it can be a projection of light on any number of surfaces, an informational component in a screen-based narrative, or one visual element among many in an environmental installation. Students will explore the dynamic intersections between moving and still; timeless and time-driven; simultaneous and sequential imaging. They will learn how to move data fluidly among different programs and to work from a broader "systems-level" perspective - a necessity in the context of today's rapidly changing software platforms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression. &lt;BR&gt; Deposit: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course all photo majors should take to help launch their careers, whatever the specialty-fine art, fashion, commercial, editorial. Classes will include lectures and instruction by the professor and outside experts, covering the breadth of issues professional photographers face, such as building their portfolio, promoting their work, finding jobs, keeping financial records, and legal issues, such as copyright, and model releases.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The core of the class involves field trips to visit artists and other photography professionals in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Those visited include many RISD photo graduates who have gone on to make careers in photography, and others who have something to teach about the many issues facing contemporary photographers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Note that the schedule of the class varies somewhat from most Wintersession classes because it includes a five-day trip to New York and Philadelphia, during the fourth week of Wintersession. The exact schedule will be available before registration opens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt; Open to all majors. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making. We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them. We'll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers. Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.) Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*FRANCE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN PARIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over a period of five weeks, students will come to know well the magnificent city of Paris with its abundant museums, significant architecture, atmospheric parks and intimate cafes. Paris and its environs will be the catalyst for inspiring students of all levels of photography to begin or to continue to develop technical skills and to explore personal visions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In discussions on the work of past and contemporary photographers, in-group critiques which investigate "learning how to see" and how to create "good" photographs, and in individual meetings, students are encourage to respond in unique ways to photographic problems.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The class begins with the use of film and the black and white analog darkroom. Students are encouraged to have a 35mm SLR film camera or larger. Using film and the 35mm camera as the beginning tool for employing the visual language of art, students will process film and print in the well-appointed and maintained facility of the Photography Studies in France (Speos). Once everyone has worked in the darkroom, we will move onto working with digital cameras and it is hoped that students will have a DSLR. In support of the digital part of the class there will be classes in Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and a special class in creating a perfect file for output at a lab. The Speos building is located in the 11th arrondisement of Paris near the Bastille. In addition, field trips outside the city will introduce students to the countryside, as well as afford further photographic opportunities. The study of photography in Paris is sure to have an impact on the creative life of a student at any level of photography in immeasurable ways! &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.  A minimum gpa of 2.5 is required.  Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Estimated Travel Cost: $5,580.00 - airfare not included.&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEERING PHOTOGRAPHY: A LENS TO PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How can queerness as an "oppositional relation to the norm" (David Halperin, 1995) inform and challenge the photographic practice? Queering photography is a seminar/studio course that will examine how queer artists have utilized photography and how these practices can inform our own making. This course will survey different aspects of queerness such as DIY culture, representation, performance, and more theoretical notions, like "queer time". We will ask ourselves, is it possible to subvert photographic norms? How can our photographic practice be informed by an ever-shifting notion of queerness? Through a series of lectures and peer artist reviews, we will look at artists whose practices are informed by queerness, including Yasumasa Morimura, Zanele Muholi, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and Ren Hang. We will have class discussions, studio assignments, critiques, and share our technical, conceptual and personal knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What does 'research' mean for contemporary photographers? For artists using photography within their practice? This hands-on studio course investigates and critiques the nature and scope of research and its practical application to current practice, and how research provides a critical context to help develop awareness, extend subject knowledge, and inform the creation of new artistic work. We will learn through current case studies, unpicking what kinds of processes photographers use when making work. We will investigate to what extent individual practices differ and what analogies can be drawn across those practices.  We will look at the roles of instinct and serendipity in allowing for other ideas to emerge. You will develop and hone your own research methods through a wide variety of experimental making and writing assignments, and through critique. This course is also a research project in itself, bringing together examples of photographic practice for you to ponder and engage into our own ideas, processes, and projects. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major as an elective. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FOCUSING INWARD: SELF-PORTRAIT IN PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>By turning the camera on oneself, the student will investigate and focus on the body, psyche, subjectivity, objectiveness and the representation of self. Looking at oneself through a camera can lead to a self-discovery and heightened awareness, helping to understand ourselves better,and our relation to the system/context we function in. By repetitive turn of the camera at the self, photographers can reconsider many issues concerning their identity. This can trigger creation of work that comes into conversation with status quo of the roles we are formed in different situations/scenarios and our inner needs and desires. Through weekly presentations students will find a common understanding, due to conversations of what viewers see and what an artist was focused on during the photography process, of how the self is represented. As a result students will develop a body of work, pushing boundaries of personal and social awareness. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Through careful attention to the problems of image-making, this class will attempt a collective reframing of anxiety as a tool for developing criticality and social engagement. Over the course of the semester, we will look at the intersections of photography, performance and activism, using collaborative exercises and group reading to make (and learn from) art that addresses hierarchies of institutional and societal power. Drawing from short readings by Hito Steyerl, Adrian Piper, Sara Ahmed, Jalal Toufic, Frantz Fanon, Ariella Azoulay and Susan Sontag, students are invited to consider the politics of material, experience and form as they relate to their own studio practices, and to build a sense of direction that will inform their roles as artists within a global community. Students will be assessed on their participation, responses to short writing exercises, and visual prompts. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $40.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective; sophomore and above.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Grad Print I will focus on the notion that Printmaking (and its constituent processes/techniques) are a "hub" within the visual arts. Students will experiment with a multitude of print processes that branch from drawing (a logical creative starting-point between Printmaking and Painting), and form extensions into the mediums of painting, sculpture, installation, and even video.

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO SILKSCREEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>     Silkscreen is often viewed as the simplest and most accessible of all the printmaking techniques. Indeed, it is fairly easy to learn, and does not require a lot of equipment. However, it is extremely versatile and can be applied to any kind of practice, while remaining relevant in contemporary art making. The current world of image proliferation does not allow time to really understand how images are made; learning silkscreen and going through this labor intensive, time consuming process is an interesting way to take some time to decipher what making an image really means, while acquiring a critical eye on our saturated surroundings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; As you probably guessed, silkscreen will be our default medium for this class, and a wide range of printing techniques will be covered. The first part of this course will explore the fundamentals; students should master the basics before experimenting with the medium. The second part will be focused on the students' own practices and will be inherently more experimental. And no, we will not be making T-shirts. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITHOGRAPHY I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>  The first part of this course will look at the traditional printmaking processes involving stone lithography- from graining a stone, drawing, processing to printing an edition. Technical fundamentals of drawing in autographic ink, crayon and tusche on stone will be demonstrated. Students taking this class will familiarize themselves with these techniques while engaging and pushing their drawing skills and personal visual imagery within the limitations and explorations that stone lithography offers. At the start of week four, the class will collectively come up with a theme for a print exchange where each student will make an edition of 10. This print exchange and their respective images will be presented on the last day of class and each student will take home a stack of prints. This course is designed for students who have little to no experience with lithography and/or printmaking. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LETTERPRESS PRINTING ON THE VANDERCOOK PROOF PRESS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At the intersection of commercial and fine art printing, letterpress printing offers the opportunity to employ craftsmanship in design and hone message making through the process of creating visually and tactilely interesting, physically present work.  The processes also allows for high volume multiples for greater dissemination of information, without eliminating the human presence from the process.  The goal of the course is to enable students to use their voices on the public stage to better engage, confront, protest, and push for a more present and informed citizenry.  &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course will serve as an introduction to letterpress printing, where students will learn to operate and troubleshoot a Vandercook Universal II proof press.  Techniques to be covered will include handset typesetting, printing and routine troubleshooting on the Vandercook proof press, photopolymer platemaking from digital and mechanically produced film, and multicolor printing and registration.   &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO INTAGLIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since the invention of the printing press, printmaking has been uniquely tied to text. In this course, we will use intaglio printmaking as a medium for exploring how images and words can come together to inform and expand our practices. We will experiment with the role text can play as a visual element, research tool, and vehicle for clarifying ideas. Intaglio printmaking will provide the medium for exploring the relationship between text and image. Student-artists will learn techniques including drypoint, hard and soft ground etching, aquatint, and photo-based intaglio as they work toward a final project that brings together text and image. This course will focus on the development of ideas through the interplay of visual and textual modes of thinking, group discussions, demonstrations, group and individual critiques, museum and special collections visits, and creation of a final print portfolio. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through weekly demonstration and assignments, students will acquire skills in both adhesive and non-adhesive binding as well as basic box making techniques. There will be opportunities to closely study various kinds of books from instructor's personal collection and the RISD Library Special Collections. Problem solving skills and decision-making skills will be further developed by countless practices and experiments. At the end of the semester, students will have thorough understanding of the anatomy of books, how to make them, how to plan and execute their own design, where to acquire materials and tools, and more.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED SILKSCREEN: LARGE SCREEN PRINT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is intended to build on a basic Screen print foundation. Beginning with fine tuning basic stencil making and registration and printing techniques. The course will move on to working big. It's what screen printing can do more efficiently and in a lower cost-effective way than any other traditional printmaking technique. The class will cover printing with a one arm squeegee designed for printing large stencils and on a 10-foot fabric/paper printing table made to print along lengths of paper or fabric, joining each impression to the previous one to create continuous surfaces.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Methods for producing handmade stencils to making the matrix from fine dot digitally made positives will be demonstrated and taught. Screen printing on substrates from fabrics, rolled paper, rag sheets and other surfaces will be explored.  Images can involve repeated pattern, be large scale image oriented, or tiled depending on each student's individual content issues and image needs. In the second half of the semester the students will embark on a research project aimed at; producing a large-scale print or series of large scale prints, printed fabric yardage, rolled wallpaper, installation. A proposal due at mid semester will serve as a starting point for the project it should speak to; focus and direction, content and form, the techniques and strategies planned, how will the stencils be made; handmade photo, computer generated half tones or line, what materials, tools will you use what will you print on. What artist influence the work? What do you look to and at for inspiration? &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is the meaning of contemporary? What is the meaning of critique? What are models for sustainable and ethical artistic practice? What is the role of the artist in contemporary culture? These are but a few of the frameworks we will use to explore an array of new tools for thinking, feeling, perceiving, and analyzing the textures of our inter-subjective environment. Together, we will address the challenges implicit in the willful consideration of what exists beyond what we think we know; beyond what we have been told is true about our chosen field as artists. We take up this exploration through a selection of readings, films, lectures and class discussions. Some of the discourses we engage include the relationship between politics and aesthetics, critical race theory, myriad feminist theories, theories of institutional critique, and methods of radical practice in contemporary art.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Sculpture majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We will create a unique learning environment where a classroom space is dedicated solely to the making and the display of the course work for the duration of the semester. This approach will encourage the participants to generate work that cannot be "carted in and carted out for a critique". The opportunity creates a unique format for interacting and making work within RISD's academic and facility structure. The explorations in this course are based on the fact that absolutely everything is a material and that everything can be manipulated using conditional approaches, responses and skills.&lt;BR&gt;  We will start with fundamental skills that use; contextual influences, site specific analysis and behavioral observations. The emphasis will always be on making. You must be willing to adapt the way you work and collaborate with one another during the development and fabrication of every exploration. There will be occasions when you are used as material to be worked with. &lt;BR&gt; After a series of investigations and assignments, studio participants will generate work that is connected to their own interests. Together we will also create an environment within the room that supports the optimum display for all of the individual works. Everyone will be required to document their individual process and contribute to a final class compilation. This course supports the exploration and engagement of interdisciplinary and experiential learning.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective &lt;BR&gt;Open to junior and above&lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Department.&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCULPTURAL PRACTICES I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is an introduction to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SPATIAL VIDEO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our eyes are nearly always drawn towards something moving over something inert. What innovative strategies can be employed to incorporate video, sculpture, and physical space into a single work, without one medium dominating the other? How can an artist resolve the fundamental differences between two-dimensional moving images and three-dimensional objects or space? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of assimilating video, photography, sound, performance, objects, and space through studying and constructing multimedia sculpture and installations. Throughout the semester we will be presented with assignments that examine these different possibilities from multiple perspectives, including studio projects that deploy video in a sculptural context, and sculpture that is only activated through a video work. We will study the recent history of artists and designers who engage multimedia techniques and experiment with new formats and technologies. Students will learn the basics of DSLR camera technique, digital video editing, audio production, audio/video display technology, and installation techniques. Students in the course should have an understanding of sculptural materials and fabrication techniques, and should be ready to experiment with the fundamental structure of the presentation of media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED CRITICAL ISSUES SEMINAR II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Critical Issues Seminar 2 introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for thinking and writing about contemporary sculpture practice. Each seminar develops from a specific theme drawing on research from Grad Critical Issues 1, current debates in the field and contemporary events. Past seminars include: Artificial Natures, Precarious Relations, Frankenstein and Crime, Vanishing Points, as examples. Trespassing across sculpture, performance, cinema, fiction, feminist, queer, race and political theory and back again, we will address writings by Walter Benjamin, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Jacques Rancire (as examples) in conversation with contemporary artists writings and projects to cultivate a conceptual grammar to extend to our studio practice. Approaching issues in contemporary sculpture through these discursive perspectives generates new strategies simultaneously material, conceptual, and critical. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Sculpture majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCULPTURAL PRACTICES II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuiation of Sculptural Practices I. Students are introduced to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OPERATIONAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is Operational Drawing? This workshop will make inroads into answering the question by making works that address how we image the body in time and space with tools and media. Akin to dance, drawing just might be the next human activity that engages a spontaneous simultaneous interplay of thought, action and acting upon. In this studio we will be working together and individually to explore how drawing is might to your studio practice. Drawing as a practice has often been mistakenly viewed as a preparatory or even secondary element within traditional studio practices like painting, sculpture and printmaking. Today, in an expanded field, those outmoded viewpoints only stand to unfairly discriminate and rank modes of realizing concept and form. It is also true that this archaic view of drawing has origins in the humble materials often associated within the practice, such as charcoal, graphite, chalk, and carbon black (ink). These geological elements on top of skin like substrates were once the defining features of the activity, but in a contemporary studio practice it is the artist's prerogative to either work with or challenge historical presets. The role of drawing in a contemporary studio practice may play multiple roles. Together we will look at, practice and explore that very thing through installations, group projects and large scale immersive work.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERFORMANCE: OBJECT, BODY, NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores questions and methods central to performance, and in particular the relationship between performance and sculpture. Temporal and spatial dimensions of both sculpture and performance will be discussed in terms of the performance "prop" as sculpture, sculptural outcomes of performance, and sculptural documentation of performance. We will examine performance in its social, political, formal, and corporeal aspects, engaging questions of ritual, labor, and movement. Approaching sculpture in both the conventional and the "expanded" senses of the term, we will pose the question of "immaterial" sculptural forms and actions. We will consider immaterial "sculpture" as performance while also considering traditional sculpture's material concerns as performative. Sculptural material concerns of process and technique; site and context; and objects and objecthood will all be examined as performance prompts. Art historical and political questions of power, agency, audience, gaze, attention, and passivity will take shape as we theorize and enact performativity and its relation to embodiment, display, and language. Through individual and collaborative work, students will create and critique performances. A range of text, sound, lens, and object-based documentation will be encouraged. Documentation will be considered both as representational and as generative.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCULPTURAL FABRIC STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class is a hands-on studio elective that explores the potential of fabric as a sculpture material.  We will spend the semester looking at useful examples of how fabrics have been utilized in a broad range of engineered solutions. Fabrics can be flexible, transparent, impermeable, delicate, rigid, lightweight, and stronger than steel. How has fabric been used to represent other materials in art? We will explore how fabric is being used in architecture, advertising, fashion, and design. We will consider the diverse functionality of all kinds of fabric and plastic materials and explore how these materials are engineered for specific purposes. We will study inflatable fabric structures as they have been engineered for art, architecture, advertising and functional objects. Students will build their own projects after learning the basics of patternmaking, assembly, and surface manipulation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to juniors and above. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is structured according the notion that artists can use what is on hand to research and craft simple solutions to the complex physical, mechanical, and technical problems that must be routinely addressed in their making practices. This material and process based, hands-on, research studio will be structured in response to the issues that the advanced fine arts student is grappling with on a regular basis. Many of the issues that arise in the process of making provide the opportunity to transcend perceived material-based boundaries and thinking. Some of the questions this course attends to include: How do you defy gravity? How do you generate the hidden components required to physicalize the thing we can see in our mind's eye? How is the magic we need to create our work scalable to the resources we have readily available? Example working processes include: mig welding, tig welding, casting for prototyping, woodworking, and mold making. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to fine arts majors only; juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops narrative of found objects in conversation with site. Autobiogeographical references will be utilized as an original point for creating object-hood. These investigations will then serve as a departure point for creating sculptural works rooted in interdependent relationships with environment, How can the function of found objects be subverted to re-contextualize narratives? What kind of narratives can be formed in response to site for engagement? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through a series of experimental exercises in writing and sketching, students will engage in generative assignments that will mutate through iterative processes. Final projects will hinge on the cumulative exploration of found object intersectionality, as well as site and audience specificity. Texts such as Miwon Kwon's One Place after Another, Sara Ahmed's Orientations: Towards Queer Phenomenology, and Fred Moten and Stefan Harney's Undercommons: Fugitive Planning and Black Study will be investigated alongside studio work. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCLUPTURE 101: THE ARTIST'S JOKE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What roles can humor play in the contemporary artist's practice? How can it be used to access, empower or veil our creative expressions? What is at stake? What does it mean to take the un-serious seriously - and why bother? In this combined seminar &amp; studio class we will be studying comedic aesthetics and formulas in contemporary &amp; historic performance, art, film and writing, and creating responsive new works, both individually and collaboratively. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through readings, viewings and presentations, we will survey comedic tropes and structures of the absurd, deadpan, tragi-comic, slapstick, ironic, parody and more. Looking particularly to the myriad ways in which visual artists have borrowed from these comedic arsenals, we will respond to such thematic tropes through regular short assignments in various media and a longer final project. Working in video and performance, photography and documentation, concrete comedy, scores, and installation, we will consider our own positions to the presented comedic lineage and develop new ways to enrich or divert our personal art practices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Assigned readings and screenings will look to great thinkers from Sigmund Freud to Richard Pryor, Henri Bergson to Joan Rivers. Relocating this material to the artist's studio, further inspiration will be mined from the works of Andrea Fraser, Bas Jan Ader, Fischli &amp; Weiss, Mike Smith, Rachel Harrison, Sarah Lucas, William Wegman, and many more. Sense of humor not required. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $25.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Dreaming, pre-visualizing, observing, and recording objects in time and space are longstanding drawing practices. In this workshop we will explore methods of seeing the world in new ways with the intention of developing advanced, weird, wonderful, and even improbable graphical representations. Students will explore observational, technical, digital and photographic tools that may be harnessed, combined, bent and hacked in service of cultivating drawing practices that serve object-making. Throughout the course students will be encouraged to innovate and improvise between methods, materials and modes of presentation. Students will harness the foundational skills that comprise the advanced, companion drawing practices utilized by artists who work in three dimensions. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Using an interdisciplinary, conceptually-minded approach, this course aims to help students identify, research, and begin to develop a solo show through the exploration of a gallery as a sculptural and inherently political space. Just as artists consider the formal and conceptual qualities of individual pieces, how can this consideration be expanded to encompass an exhibition space and the art world in which it resides?   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Areas of focus will include new techniques for research, documentation, proposal writing, and portfolio building. Through considering the design of a solo show and the space it is shown in, students can interrogate their broader conceptual, political, and career goals. We will look to the work and writings of Brenna Bhandat, Martine Syms, Rainer Ganahl, Okin Collective, Na hyun, Anuradha Vikram and Sarah Ahmed and others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By structuring the course around quick, experimental exercises that are individualized to push students out of their material and conceptual comfort zones, we hope to help students unravel and dig deeper into the existing underlying themes in their work. In addition to these exercises, which will result in partner, small group, and one-on-one feedback, students will do readings and research about the political frameworks and social implications of different exhibition space models, ranging from the commercial gallery to DIY spaces.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL PRACTICES: CURATION AND DISTRIBUTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course performs two areas of discourse related to artistic practice for Sculpture graduates: curation and artist's texts. It seeks to develop a deeper understanding of the contextual and social ramifications of artwork outside the artist's studio and how texts and other ephemera can function alongside work and practice. This course suggests that curation is an important part of the art-historical project of directing attention not only to art, but to its context. The single most important factor in how an artist's work is understood, is usually the one she has least control over: context. Curation (as the construction of context) and critique (as the uncovering of this context) are key to creating this control. Curation has evolved from a specialized sub-profession that involved "taking care" of esoteric collections, to an amorphous gatekeeping practice for the cultural world, that includes exhibition-making, criticism, and project management. Readings on theory and history will be given alongside discussions, studio visits and critiques. The semester will culminate in an exhibition of the first-year graduates individual works collaboratively curated in a off-campus space. Students will walk away with an understanding of contemporary curation's historical/institutional affiliations, a battery of concepts and theories with which to reinterpret curatorial practice, and concrete experience curating their own exhibition.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The second focus of this course deals with the use of text, language, and images as catalysts for constructing the Thesis Book for second year graduates. Students will examine and further develop a writing practice in conjuction with (and in support of) their studio practice. A variety of research practices will be emphasized as a significant part of the writing and thesis building process. The instructor will mentor the graduates on an individual basis as well as collective writing sessions. Emphasis will be made on how this process can open up unexpected paths of inquiry and how the Thesis Book can be a useful starting point for Professional Practice outcomes post-graduate school. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major elective; Sculpture majors only.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RE-CASTING: SWAP MEET CULTURE CLASH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The swap meet is a gathering usually convened for the purpose of selling or bartering second hand objects. People representing differing cultural identities and values come into close proximity to one another at the swap meet, presenting their wares and hoping to find new value. The swap meet is also a site where things that have fallen out of use or no longer serve a purpose await reinvention. In this course we will explore the model of the swap meet as an opportunity to reinvent and alter existing objects and media from dominant culture with the express purpose of re-inserting what is created back into culture, at large. Some methods we might consider include sales, trade, e-commerce, and online platforms where users recontextualize content. In this course students will explore mold-making techniques for making multiples or duplicating existing forms, as well as gain an understanding of editing programs for the remixing of found footage. The course will culminate in a non-traditional exhibition. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD TEXTILES: TRADE, TRADITIONS, TECHNIQUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology from around the globe will be explored in classroom lecture and utilizing the RISD Museum of Art. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Thoughtful and scholarly consideration will be given to recent incidents of cultural appropriation in the global textile and fashion industry. Term projects utilizing the material culture approach will afford students the opportunity to gain valuable research skills and explore in-depth specific textile techniques. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be pre-registered by the department. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  A series of small assignments will build up a repertoire of techniques and culminate in a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personalized images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration for Spring semester.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TAKES SHAPE: REUSE AND RE-APPROPRIATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Trolls, bots and memes oh my!  In the forest of online hocus-pocus, where does form and material exploration IRL exist? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of image and material appropriation through textile-based study and construction.  We will engage with rudimentary forms of  off-loom weaving, hand knitting, felting and latch hook rug techniques as they pertain to building sculptural form.  Students will be introduced to histories of artists and designers as well as explore methodologies of montage, trompe l'oeil and collage through lectures, readings and visits to the RISD Museum's Costume Collection.  We will look at such artists as Betye Saar, Shinique Smith, Stan Brakhage, Josh Faught, Mike Kelley, Marcel Duchamp, Jessica Stockholder, Hannah Hch, Wangechi Mutu and Wendy Red Star.  The class will explore pattern making, re-using and recycling materials to new ends and applying methodologies and techniques to unorthodox materials.   Students in the course do not need a background in textiles or sculpture, but should be open and ready to experiment, discuss and explore individually and as a group. The final week of the class will be the making of a work that will bring together the threads of the previous weeks' exploration, experimentation and study.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL EMBROIDERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  A series of small assignments will build up a repertoire of techniques and culminate in a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personalized images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration for Spring semester.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEXTILES TRANSFORMING INTO FURNITURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research course focuses on the experimentation with soft materials utilizing techniques of textile construction to create functional furniture with structural integrity. This course will rely on teamwork between Furniture Design and Textile students to take advantage of each other's expertise in furniture making and textile construction. In the beginning of the course students will be introduced to examples of contemporary furniture design, which use soft materials in unconventional ways to create unexpected forms and experiences. Reading will be assigned that covers these contemporary examples in detail. Parallel to this students will be exposed to weaving and knitting techniques, but should also consider other techniques such as crocheting, knotting, basket weaving etc. Students are encouraged to alter these techniques according to their needs to discover unique design solutions. Additionally, students will be introduced to unconventional materials not necessarily associated with furniture to generate innovative results. Substructures constructed out of solid materials can be used to provide rigidity as well as glue/resin to reinforce soft materials. Since this course focuses on material research, students are expected to engage in sustained in-depth inquiry, which should be documented in a meaningful way throughout the entire process. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design and Textiles Departments, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2523; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play! &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement for MA; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN EDUCATION WORKSHOP II: PLACE - PRODUCT - SYSTEM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The place, product and systems design problems and exercises in this fall studio-based workshop build on the documentation design tools developed during the summer design course TLAD-654G Design Education Workshop I.  The sequence of courses have been developed in tandem specifically to expand the repertoire of K-12 educators' curriculum toolkits to include design. Further, this course provides educators with an invaluable foundation with which to engage in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) teaching.   This course, with an emphasis on place, product and system, introduces design principles as tools for creative problem solving and making as related to the physical world we inhabit.  In this course, students experiment with materials, work at the scale of the body, with spaces of enclosure and gathering, and with complex built and natural environmental systems.  The goal is to work as a designer, using design principles and methodologies as a way to explore the world in which we live and to experiment with materials in ways that address everyday problems. In working through the course design problems, students are introduced to design tools and materials for observation, iteration, prototyping and documenting user experience to solve design problems. Throughout the course, students adapt newly introduced design methods to curriculum proposals for design teaching and learning elementary and secondary school settings.  &lt;B&gt; The combined set of design toolkits developed through the summer and fall design education studio workshops will assist educators form the foundation for a design pedagogy to be carried forward into their K-12 art and design teaching.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for MAT &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-major graduate students by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This field-based class provides graduate students with an opportunity to experience and examine the dynamics of teaching and learning within an elementary school setting - particularly, Providence's Highlander Charter School. The course is predominantly concerned with the development of teaching and learning strategies with which to incorporate art and design into general education while at the same time maintaining both disciplines' integrity. There is a special emphasis on utilizing art and design to support any school's literacy initiative. The course is constructed with two complementary elements - a participatory component in which pairs of graduate students work collaboratively with a non-art specialist or general classroom teacher. Graduate students have the opportunity to lead small groups of children in formal teaching and learning experiences and to use these opportunities to reflect on matters of content, student understanding, and the effectiveness of communication.  The second component of the course is a seminar that uses the graduate students' authentic classroom experiences as an opportunity to examine a broad range of educational issues that include: the impact of teaching and learning environments, the diversity of learners, arts integration, culturally responsive teaching, technology in the classroom, and classroom management.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for MAT; MAT only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will examine the roles and responsibilities of non-profit arts organizations from both a practical and ideological perspective to relate them to one's own artistic or design practice or professional aspirations. The course will visit regional arts non-profits, examining their life cycles and the factors that shape an agency's success and/or failure. Organizations investigated may include: arts councils, service organizations, arts centers, alternative spaces, residency programs, community-based initiatives, foundations, and galleries. A deepening understanding of non-profits arts management including mission and vision, leadership, sustainability, relationships to the community and the public will occur. We will ask whom do they serve, what is their relevancy, and what qualitative results do they achieve? The off-campus visits and on-campus guests will serve as core information to researching and proposing a start-up non-profit, analyzing non-profits, or developing successful residency applications. This course will be of special interest to studio practitioners and educators whose professional lives are likely to intersect with arts organizations and agencies in the future.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media, yet drawing can be independent of all other media. How can we make our drawing ventures resonant or challenging? Through independent studio production and focused critique, the course provides graduate students from any major the opportunity to more deeply understand the nature of drawing through a series of self-directed and self-paced experiences and investigations. Coursework may be referenced or supported by historical and contemporary contexts. Digital works, a single drawing medium or tool, phenomenal means, or other materials or mixtures of instruments can be used for mark-making. A full spectrum of drawing ways and ideas can be explored. The class is structured around cross-major conversations in small group critiques, peer-exchange critiques, larger group reviews and individual analysis. Drawings from this course may integrate or extend other areas of graduate students' study, including thesis content and personal visual inquiries. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Department of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design requires MA candidates submit a capstone thesis in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Candidates are given a degree of flexibility in determining the format for this work, but typically it takes the form of either a thesis monograph essay or a thesis book. The thesis monograph essay provides candidates with the opportunity to focus on a deep investigation of a single subject framed within the context of learning and through art and design. An essential characteristic of this approach to the thesis is in how it provides evidence of the candidate's ability to move beyond description to analysis and how they are able to place the subject of investigation within the realm of scholarship. The thesis book provides a candidate with the opportunity to make sense of their journey through their program in a more autobiographical and documentary manner. The thesis book format affords candidates the opportunity to explore how form can be exploited to visualize research. Whether presented as a thesis monograph essay or thesis book, this capstone requirement provides MA candidates with a formal opportunity to make public their understanding about a specific aspect of the nature of arts learning gained through their coursework, excursions into the scholarly literature and fieldwork experiences. The purpose here, therefore, is to conceive of the thesis not merely as an academic exercise but also contributing to program development as well as providing a reservoir of understandings that will inform the candidate's future professional practice as an educator.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course involves completing an internship with an art teacher two days a week in either public or private schools. Students enrolled in this course will hopefully, be able to translate some of their excitement for art and design to the school setting, and in doing so, become a valuable resource to both the art teacher and his/her students.  Students taking this course are also required to attend and participate in a weekly seminar to discuss their experiences and to further explore a variety of issues related to teaching art and design at the K-12 level. Selected readings, a directed reflective journal, presentations, and a leave-behind contribution to the assigned school are among the assignments for this course.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROFESSIONAL INTERNSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides MA students with the unique opportunity to complete a professional practice internship in a real world setting. The internship has a number of purposes but is particularly designed to expand the candidate's experience of arts-related programming in one of a number of venues including but not limited to: community arts centers, alternative arts spaces, foundations, museums, schools, hospitals, arts agencies, etc. An internship site is made in consultation with TLAD's Department Head who is in a particularly strong position to advise and recommend potential local and regional sites that might be an appropriate fit for a candidate. MA candidates are also encouraged to identify potential internship sites and the Department is very willing to make an institutional advance to an individual or organization in order to facilitate and establish an internship agreement. It is important for candidates to recognize that while they might wish to have a very particular internship, the ultimate placement is very much dependent upon the readiness of a particular site to accept an intern. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective for MA; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
