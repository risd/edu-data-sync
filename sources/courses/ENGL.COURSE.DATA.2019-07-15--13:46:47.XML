   <COURSETITLE>EHP ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THAD I: GLOBAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a required course for all freshmen and transfer students to introduce them to global modern and contemporary art, architecture and design in the period between 1750 and the present. The course addresses modernism as a global project, presenting several case studies from across the world that unfold to show how multiple kinds of modernism developed in different times and distant places. By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates. There are no waivers for THAD-H101. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Attention transfers and upperclass students: Please register into one of the evening sections set aside for transfer and upperclass students if you have not completed this first-year graduation requirement. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator in the Liberal Arts Division office for assistance if needed. All other H101 sections are for freshmen. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO MUSEUM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Museum is a significant and changing institution during the 21st century.  This class will subject the institution to scholarly critique.  We will consider the types of museums, the organization of museums, the curating of exhibitions, the growing role of on-line components in museums and the various support areas in the museum (finance, membership, etc.).  Ethics in the museum and sensitivity to audiences will also be part of our study.  We will visit the RISD museum and other local Providence museums.  Students will write catalogue entries, exhibition reviews and short papers that analyze readings.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FORMS, WORDS, AFFECTS: THEORIES AND METHODS OF ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class examines different methods of interpretation employed by art historians and art critics to "read" works of art. Each week we will focus on a particular methodological approach central to the production of art historical knowledge such as Formalism, Iconography, Psychoanalysis, Semiotics, Post-Structuralism, Museum Studies, Critical Theory, Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Affect Theory, and Postcolonial Theory. The course also looks into the history of the discipline itself by way of reading primary texts written by art historians and thinkers whose thoughts and writings, in one way or another, have shaped the discipline of art history. We will also consider responses from non-Western scholars to the predominantly Western narratives that are at the center of the field.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MODERN AND CONTEMPORARY ART OF LATIN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course serves as an introduction to modern and contemporary art of Latin America from c. 1900 to the present day. Beginning with the international formulation of modernismos and the institutionalization of muralism in Mexico, we will trace the development of various, contested "modernisms" throughout the Americas. Rather than adhering to a strictly linear chronology, we will approach this vast region and its histories through a constellation of themes that, together, will illuminate the uneven development of modernism across the hemisphere. We will address questions relating to the nature of national and international identity, as well considering the porous relation between Latin American modernisms and their European and U.S. counterparts. Just what is "Latin American" art? Is it defined by geography, by nationality, or in some other way? And does it fit into the received canon of "Western" art history?  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ART OF RITUAL; EUROPEAN WORKS (1400-1800) IN PROVIDENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores objects and images used in rituals in pre-industrial Europe (ca. 1400-1800). A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that has its own temporal and spatial specificity. It occurs for staging religious practices, marriage, death, a ruler's visit to a city, or for creating responses in times of crises (epidemics, natural calamities, war, etc). Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society  but they are also ridden with conflict. Rituals work through the display of statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, ceremonial props, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. We will see how such objects and images gained power and what their mobility (in processions, for example) entailed.  We will study extant works as visual evidence for ephemeral events as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will help us to be critical about visual "representations" and evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in "re-presentations."&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM AND AFTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>No movement in the history of twentieth-century art is more synonymous with modernist abstraction than Abstract Expressionism. Its rise to prominence in the 1940s signaled not only a new era of American dominance in the international art world, but also a period of triumph for the project of formalist modernism. Yet in the decade that marked its immediate aftermath, an array of movements and practices arose both to challenge Abstract Expressionism's singular position in the postwar art world and to call into question the aesthetic paradigm that it embodied. In this course we will trace these developments, examining the major artists who defined Abstract Expressionism, the claims made on its behalf by the critics who theorized and debated it, the uses to which it was put in the context of Cold War politics, the fundamental questions it raised about aesthetic autonomy and expressive freedom, and the various challenges directed at it in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, most notably by Pop Art, Minimalism, and Conceptual Art. In so doing, we will attempt both to construct a broad historical account of Abstract Expressionism and to develop a critical understanding of how it helped set the stage for the dominant forms of contemporary art that would follow. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BAUHAUS WORLDWIDE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course considers modern design cultures worldwide, focusing on networks of individuals and institutions that formed across national borders since the early twentieth century. A theme of the course will be the design theories and practices initiated at the German Bauhaus in the 1920s and their subsequent international spread and local adaptation, precipitated by war, exile, migration, globalization of industry and trade, and decolonization. Case studies may include Lazlo Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago, Anni Albers at Black Mountain College, the HfG Ulm and its collaboration with schools in Brazil and India, and the recently founded Bauhaus Institute at the China Academy of Art. Throughout, we will ask what happens when the idea of universal design is adapted to local politics, economies, and design cultures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a stimulus to the imagination, method of investigation, or as a basic means of communication, drawing is a fundamental process of human thought.  This class will examine various kinds of drawings from the history of art and visual culture moving chronologically from the medieval to the post-modern. Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This seminar is recommended for THAD concentrators and students especially interested in drawing. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology from around the globe will be explored in classroom lecture and utilizing the RISD Museum of Art. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Thoughtful and scholarly consideration will be given to recent incidents of cultural appropriation in the global textile and fashion industry. Term projects utilizing the material culture approach will afford students the opportunity to gain valuable research skills and explore in-depth specific textile techniques. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be pre-registered by the department. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN FASHION THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Topics in Fashion Theory" complements the design history survey, "History of Dress." ("History of Dress" is not a prerequisite). This seminar will introduce students to theoretical debates in fashion theory, responding to scholars who define fashion as the cultural construction of embodied identity. Through the manipulation of the visual and tactile symbols of clothing (cut, cloth, texture and color) fashion expresses, however imprecisely, a configuration of individual attributes and attitudes that persons seek to communicate. But fashion most likely productively draws upon "recurrent instabilities" in collective social identities, argues Fred Davis, including masculinity versus femininity, androgyny versus singularity, license versus restraint and conformity versus rebellion. Fashion can do so because social identities are rarely the stable amalgams we take them to be: they shift over the course of a lifetime and are prodded by social and technological change. Drawing on scholarship in a range of disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, gender studies and queer theory, we will explore clothing's role in marking, or alternately containing, deflecting or sublimating, those aspects of identity linked to gender, sexuality, class, race, religion and nation. Noting that leading designers use the catwalk to present experimental clothes that often communicate brand values and the designer's identity, we will explore the extent to which fashion is currently formulating effective social commentary. &lt;BR&gt; The class integrates reading and reading responses with discussion and visual analysis of clothing and fashion across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Reading responses will help students develop four short written projects that assess and analyze debates encountered in class discussion and readings. Class time will include in-class writing and peer review. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Apparel majors only; sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Landscapes will be considered as an evolving condition, even when their defining characteristics were conceived and built at a specific point in time.  Critical to this course will be the establishment of frameworks for historical inquiry, the refinement of research methodologies, in the development of multiple perspectives through which to question and understand the design environment. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TIME, LIGHT AND SOUND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed as an introduction to the 113-year history of the projected moving image (film, animation, and video). Artistic expression in these forms will be emphasized. Students discover new areas of interest while watching carefully selected examples of films and videos. During all classes, students will view films representing different styles and periods of filmmaking. About half of the classes are devoted to contemporary films. Critical thinking will be encouraged and fostered during classroom discussions. Clear expression of these thoughts will be developed through assigned readings and weekly writing assignments. During the semester, students learn about specific artists, schools of filmmaking, genres, and fields within the history of the film, animation, and video. Students also develop a common language by learning the meaning and proper usage of a glossary of common film terms. At select classes, film artists are present to introduce and discuss their work. Other guests include improvisational musicians who accompany silent films. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; FAV majors &lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NCSS CORE SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and junior students. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for beginners in Italian and provides an introduction to the basic structures of the language and to Italian culture. Throughout the course, situations that often represent obstacles to newcomers to Italy are presented to assist students in learning how to immerse themselves into a new country and a new culture. Vocabulary and grammar are presented through teaching materials-including listening comprehensions, and the reading of Italian texts-which refer to situations relevant to the students' experience in Italy.  The study of the Italian language is integrated with an overview of contemporary Italian culture through films, music and lectures that deal with cultural topics. Students will be asked to perform role-plays, street assignments and discussions in order to enable them to speak and interact in Italian. Students are expected to participate actively in the class discussions and activities, and to contribute with suggestions, ideas and presentations &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/i&gt;), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt; ), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SOUND POETRY: HISTORY, POETICS, COMPOSITION, PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to sound poetry traditions including early 20th century European and Russian avant-gardes; mid-to late 20th century North American experimentation; and contemporary performance across a range of cultures, languages, and media. We will also study specific styles, phenomena, and movements, e.g., scat, silbo gomero, and hip hop, and students will be invited to present and work with examples from cultural and language traditions in which they are interested. Particular attention will be paid to contemporary practitioners, and to relationships between material traditions of poetry including sound, visual, and digital. Students will build knowledge of coordinated examples of sound poetry; compose and perform sound poems; and write and present a research paper. Texts may include Anne Carson, "The Gender of Sound," Jay-Z, Decoded, Christian Bk, Eunoia, Marjorie Perloff and Craig Dworkin's The Sound of Poetry/The Poetry of Sound, and the archive ubuweb.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE NATION &amp; ITS DISCONTENTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the relationship between narrative and national constructions in the literature and film produced by a variety of American authors during the 20th and 21st centuries. We will analyze texts from various authors in light of shifting paradigms in American thought, politics, and expressive culture.  Our primary investigation is twofold: (1) to understand pervasive themes in U.S. literature, including the in/commensurability of American democracy and its continued exclusionism, (2) to become conversant with theories of nationalism, sexuality, gender, race and class. As we pursue our inquiry, we will examine the historical, political, economic, and ideological factors that have created and shaped the narratives of Americans of different "backgrounds." </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like &lt;I&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt; Melancholia&lt;/I&gt; illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of &lt;I&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/I&gt; in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's &lt;I&gt;Shalimar the Clown&lt;/I&gt; or Bahman Ghobadi's &lt;I&gt;Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists&lt;/I&gt;, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's &lt;I&gt;The Submission&lt;/I&gt;, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's &lt;I&gt;Flight Behavior&lt;/I&gt;, Krakauer and Penn's &lt;I&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/I&gt;, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary &lt;I&gt;Gasland&lt;/I&gt;, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in &lt;I&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/I&gt;, and imaginary places in films like &lt;I&gt;After Life&lt;/I&gt; (Kore-eda Hirokazu), &lt;I&gt;Micmacs&lt;/I&gt; (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and &lt;I&gt;Marwencol&lt;/I&gt; (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURES II: IRELAND, OCEANIA, AND THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Postcolonial literature is the writing produced by people in or from regions that have escaped the yoke of colonialism.  Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our readings will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Australia, India, Indonesia, Ireland, New Zealand, Samoa, and Sri Lanka.  This history of trading empires and settler colonies will be a major focus in this course.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them.  Writers may include Ciaran Carson, Lionel Fogarty, Keri Hulme, R.K. Narayan, Michael Ondaatje, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Albert Wendt.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REMAKING THE WORLD: ANGLO-AMERICAN MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the way in which dominant movements within Anglo-American modernist literature between 1890 and 1960 reflect artists' attempts to reimagine the world around them and humanity's place within it, including such stylistic developments as imagism and expressionism. The transformation of traditional genres and styles which characterizes the period is famously encapsulated by poet Ezra Pound's declaration that artists of all kinds must "Make It New." Focusing on both literal and figurative ex-patriot authors of the United States and United Kingdom, students can expect to read the novels and poetry of such authors as Samuel Beckett, T.S. Eliot, David Jones, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and Virginia Woolf --authors whose writings exemplify some of the most radical experimentations of the modernist period.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEATER,PERFORMANCE,&amp;POLITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is political about theatre and performance and when does politics become theatrical? What are some of the assumptions and desires that animate the relationship between theatre, performance, and politics? How has this relationship been practiced, understood and theorized over time, and most importantly, in contemporary circumstances? What relationship does political theatre have with the local, the national and the transnational? This course seeks to approach these questions through readings that may include works by Sophocles, Brecht, Heaney, Boal, Friel, Churchill, Edgar, Tendulkar, Soyinka, Fusco, Deavere Smith, Pinter and Nottage along with relevant theoretical texts. Screenings might include videos related to recent US presidential elections, musical and artistic performances, and acts of contemporary culture jamming activists like "The Yes Men."&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Fascism got you down?  Tired of endless war?  Wondering how art could possibly stand up to--let alone subvert--the predations of big-time capitalism and its police state?  Unfortunately, these are not new questions.  Fortunately, they were taken on directly by two of the twentieth century's most provocative theatrical innovators.  Bertolt Brecht (German, 1898-1956) and Dario Fo (Italian, 1926-2016) were both theorists and practitioners who saw the theater as a platform for arts activism.  Drawing on popular, traditional forms, which they deployed in response to the acute crises of their times, Brecht and Fo broke and then rewrote the theatrical rulebook for our epoch, drawing condemnation and censorship from official institutions, but profound praise from audiences the world over.  Students in this course will read exemplary works (e.g., Brecht's Threepenny Opera, Mother Courage and Her Children, Galileo, St. Joan of the Stockyards; Fo's Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Mistero Buffo, Can't Pay? Won't Pay!) before concluding the term by examining their legacies among playwrights as diverse as David Hare, Tony Kushner, Caryl Churchill, Alecky Blythe, Lynn Nottage, Augusto Boal and Mark Ravenhill.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMA AND NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have shaped contemporary media and culture in profound ways, including how we make, experience, and talk about art, design, commerce, and culture, bodies, identities, and communities, privacy, security, and war, time, space, and geography, and even the politics of meaning and "truth" themselves. In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMICS AND GRAPHIC LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINESE CINEMA: QUESTIONS OF NATIONALISM, REALISM, AND FILM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore Chinese Cinema as a national cinema and as a transnational cinema in both its popular and classic forms; however, the term 'Chinese' has been and is still a debated term among the very populations that lay claim to it, i.e., mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chinese diaspora, the People's Republic. These debates make the study of Chinese film a study of how to categorize or know film itself. In other words, exploring Chinese film in a Western critical arena within the hegemony of Western film studies begs theoretical questions about the very dominant and commonplace terms and perspectives used to examine all film in the 21st century, i.e, What are these films showing us?  What are we looking for?  What do we see?  Investigating these theoretical quandaries will also be a part of this course.  We will survey representative films produced before 1949, during the shift from of the cultural capital from Yan'an to Shanghai 1950-1964, during the Cultural Revolution (1964-1986), and during its emergence as the premier transnational cinema (late-1980s to 2000s).  We will also consider the particular film genres and film schools of Chinese cinema. Students will be responsible for reading critical and theoretical essays, viewing all required films, writing analytical papers on assigned topics, and presenting one oral sequence analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Beginning Poetry Workshop is an elective course introducing students to the art of poetry writing. The course sequentially addresses major commitments of poetry including form/content, sound, line, voice, image, language(s), tradition/convention, experiment, audience, revision, performance, collection, publication, and distribution. Workshop is the heart of the course, animating the practice, discourse, critique, audience, community, and mentorship vital to poets. Every class will also include close reading, discussion of assigned texts, and writing. We will attend public readings, curate and participate in community readings, and welcome poets to our class, when possible. Work can be developed in a range of styles, traditions, and languages. You will leave this class with a collection of workshopped and revised poems, which you will design, self-publish, and distribute in print and/or digital form.  &lt;BR&gt;The Beginning Poetry Workshop is a prerequisite for the LAS-E421 Advanced Poetry Workshop in the Spring. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the vast, variegated field of critical theory. We will study the concepts, questions, and debates that have been central to understandings of modern culture. In order to do so, we will explore key contributions in psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonial studies. As we explore this wide range of approaches, we will interrogate how thinkers have imagined and reimagined terms like "art," "reading," "subjectivity," "modern," "discipline," "culture," "power," "technology," "sovereignty" and "nature," among others. And as we build this critical lexicon, we will examine the social institutions and intellectual formations that shape each debate. What kinds of knowledge does critical theory produce, and what are their blindspots? What forms of personhood and community do these theories outline, and in whose interests? What kinds of insights become visible when we examine conflicting theories together? Thinkers include Adorno, Agamben, Althusser, Barthes, Benjamin, Benveniste, Bhabha, Butler, Chow, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Freud, Gramsci, Hall, Haraway, Irigaray, Jameson, Lacan, Latour, Levi-Strauss, Lukacs, Marx, Ranciere, Said, Saussure, Spivak, Terranova, Willliams, and others. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: WOMEN'S RESISTABCE ACROSS THE GLOBAL SOUTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores roles women have played in wars for independence and democracy across the Global South.  As the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo depicts in his iconic film, The Battle of Algiers (1966), some women fought alongside men carrying bombs in the fight for freedom from French imperialism in Algeria. However, more often, women have forged their own paths parallel to men enacting complex forms of resistance through art, mobilizing domesticity, and protest. Using women's participation in Algerian independence in the 1950s as our starting point, we will engage with women who resist the reductive fantasy of the bomb-carrying female freedom fighter throughout world. Figures under our investigative lens will include Assia Djebar who illustrates women playing new roles outside of the home in Algeria; women who led the peacemaking process in Liberia to bring Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to power; and Lina Ben Mhenni who used social media in Tunisia to show the world injustice taking place under a repressive regime in 2010. Alongside these memoirs, literary texts, historical documents, and films by and about women at war, we will develop a critical vocabulary of women at work reading theorists that include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler. Over the course of the semester, we will put these voices in conversation with one another in order to reconstruct alternative histories of resisting oppression in the Global South and beyond.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LAS OPEN SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The LAS Open Seminar is devoted to the development of undergraduate and graduate degree projects that engage the discipline of literary arts and studies, and involves the writing of a longer, research-based project (thesis, artist's statement, creative work, etc). This engagement may take a variety of different forms, including a direct referencing or interaction with literary texts or issues; a focus on textuality and/or narrativity; a concern with research and the mechanics of writing a longer project. Therefore, as the course title indicates, the seminar has an open structure to accommodate our ability to address and foster each student's interests and concerns. As the semester progresses, we will move from a discussion of texts that introduce key concepts in the framing of interdisciplinary projects to group analyses and the workshopping of each student's project. In the first part of the semester, we will discuss a number of conceptual tenets that will ground our theorization of the artistic process, including issues of intentionality and audience; issues of translation and interdisciplinarity; and the relation of form to content. The second part of the semester will be organized and driven by group analyses of the degree and related written project of each class member. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors, seniors, 5th-years and graduate students.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS-C221; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;Br&gt; LAS-E101 is a prerequisite if taken for LAS credit. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;Also offered as HPSS-C408; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Why are the Elgin Marbles in London, and not on the Acropolis?  Why do there seem to be as many mummies in France as there are in Egypt? asks Sharon Waxman in her book Loot (2008). This seminar will examine the changing role of antiquities in the post-imperialist world, and access the moral and ethical questions raised by archaeologists, curators, collectors and lawyers regarding the plunder of ancient sites to feed an international art market.  We will also review legal standards regarding cultural properties (1970 UNESCO Convention,  1991 NAGPRA, and 1995 Unidroit Convention) and how they have impacted the protection of ancient archaeological sites, forced the return of many art treasures and lesser artifacts, and become big headaches for everyone involved in the preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Also offered as HPSS-C734; register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM IN ART AND GLOBAL POLITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will survey the emergence of an avant-garde in the United States during and after World War II.  The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Beginning with the shift away from modernist abstraction in the late 1950s and proceeding chronologically, we will examine the diverse array of movements, practices, and events that have come to define the larger field of contemporary art: minimalism, conceptualism, and pop in the 1960s, site specific and performance art in the 1970s, the "culture wars" and postmodernist debates of the 1980s, and the various forms of "abject," project-based, and "relational" art that followed. Foregrounding problems that have remained central for artists throughout this period - the status of the body, the institutional conditions of artistic production and reception, the politics of representation and difference - we will focus on putting the shifting terrain of contemporary art into broad social, historical, and theoretical perspective. In turn, we will attempt to develop a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the aesthetic and political stakes of contemporary art today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY IN ASIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores major movements and practices of photography in Asia from the nineteenth century to present day. Students will be introduced to a wide range of discourses on photography and will examine special topics in Asian photography each week: topics range from the diverse ways in which photography has entailed modernity to geopolitical implications in contemporary art photography in Asia. The course will investigate photography not just as documents of historical shifts but as objects, archives, and artworks in each cultural milieu. Students are expected to actively engage in class discussions. As a term project, students will write a research paper and give a short presentation on their research.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BORDERLANDS: LATINX ART AND VISUAL CULTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on representations by, of, and for Latinx peoples in the United States, beginning with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, which ended the Mexican-American War and ceded one-third of Mexican territory to the United States, until the present day. Drawing from Glora Anzalda's theory of the "borderland" as a both physical and psychological "in-between space," we will address questions of identity and belonging, assimilation and resistance, and visibility and erasure as they are encountered and debated by (and about) diasporic communities in the United States. Topics of discussion will include nineteenth-century debates of Pan-Americanism, the popularization and critique of Hollywood stereotypes during the Good Neighbor era, and Chicanx activism of the 1960s and 1970s. Issues of racial and ethnic identity will be considered alongside and in dialogue with those of gender, sexuality, class, and immigration status, and our discussions will encompass not only visual art but also music, cinema, literature, and activism. We will ask ourselves, what is the relationship of Latinx art and visual culture to that of the U.S.? What is its relationship to "Latin American" history and identity? And how might we begin to expand our definitions of U.S. art history?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO IRANIAN CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"From international film festivals to university campuses, from museums of modern art to neighborhood theaters, Iranian cinema has now emerged as the staple of a cultural currency that defies the logic of nativism and challenges the problems of globalization." Hamid Dabashi writes this in the introduction to his landmark study of Iranian cinema, Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present and Future (Verso, 2001). This course introduces you to the history of Iranian cinema, from the Iranian New Wave (1960s) to the present. It examines the ways in it occupies an important place on the scene of global cinema while it "defies the logic of nativism." We will watch some of the most prominent movies by acclaimed Iranian filmmakers Dariush Mehrjui, Ebrahim Golestan, Nasser Taghvai, Amir Naderi, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Forough Farrokhzad, Jafar Panahi, Masoud Kimiai, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Bahram Beyzaie, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, Marzieh Meshkini, Asghar Farhadi, Tahmineh Milani, Ebrahim Hatamikia, and Kamran Shirdel. We will also look at the works of diasporic artists, including Shirin Neshat, Marjane Satrapi, Ramin Bahrani, Mitra Farahani, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Granaz Moussavi. &lt;br&gt; There is a separate evening film screening from 7:00 PM - 10:00 PM each Thursday. Students must plan to attend these as well.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART &amp; REVOLUTION IN THE 20TH CENTURY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course tracks the relationship between art and social, political, and aesthetic "revolutions, "predominantly in the Western context, through the twentieth century. As a starting point for our conversations on the conceptual and political revolutions reflected in and implicated by the artworld, we will examine the emergence of the avant-garde and its challenge to the Academy as it relates to shifting market forces, understandings of psychology, subjectivity, and the role of art in the public sphere. Exploring the significance of image-making to socio-political conditions in the first half of the century, we will look at movements including Russian Suprematism, French Surrealism, and Mexican Social-Realism. Moving into the latter half of the century we will examine the ways conversations about art and revolution became more abstract  -- though no less influenced by shifting socio-political conditions  -- exploring the emergence of postwar expressionism, conceptual, performance, and "relational aesthetics" as conceptual revolutions of understandings of art, object, and meaning.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Trojan War is one of the most influential stories in the history of Western culture.  After a brief examination of the archaeological evidence for such an event, this course will focus on the art and literature inspired by the Trojan War from Ancient Greece through modern times.  Readings will include selections from Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and take into account return stories such as the Odyssey.  Art with Trojan iconography will be explored from ancient vase-paintings and sculptures through Renaissance and Baroque depictions, up to a contemporary graphic novelization and a brief discussion of films on the subject.  Major themes include the interaction of art and literature, and the mutability of an established narrative at the hands of subsequent creators.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLABORATIVE DESIGN IN MOROCCO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores contemporary design as inspired by Moroccan artisanal crafts. Young and seasoned designers alike are poised to revolutionize the craft and design landscape in Morocco. Government and private initiatives are supporting the preservation of cultural heritage and the rise of crafts in the global marketplace. Moreover, in the realm of design theory, "craft" is experiencing a renaissance. This course will first explore contemporary craft-and-design in a broad sweep across the Middle East and other parts of the Global South. We will then take a more in-depth look at Morocco. After an overview of the colonial and post-colonial social and economic histories that have led to a revival of the crafts, we will study Morocco's diverse landscape of cultural products and styles. Selecting several case studies of contemporary designers inspired by and/or working with crafts and craftspeople in Morocco, we will discuss the ups and downs of their journeys through a complex network of traditional practices and expectations. Throughout the semester, we will draw upon visual and textual source material through in-class discussions and virtual conversations with Moroccan designers and craftspeople. </COURSEDESC>

This class examines the material culture of late consumer capitalism, focusing on how objects organize experience in everyday life. We will investigate the practices through which things-from food and clothing to smart phones-become meaningful, as we tackle political and ethical questions related to the design, manufacture, use and disposal of material goods. The class will introduce students to a range of scholarship on material culture from several disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, history, sociology, art and architectural history, and cultural studies. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY AND MILITARISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography became especially popular as a vernacular and political medium around the time of the Crimean War in the nineteenth century. Since then, photography has been a critical medium that represents, commemorates, propagates, opposes, and complicates war and militarism across the globe. Histories of photography in the twentieth and twenty-first century have also unfolded through colonization, genocide, war, liberation, globalization, and war on terror. Militarism has thus been crucial to the medium's history: photography does not merely re-present the militarized life-in-the-making; it is an integral part of it. This course examines the ways in which the subject of photography has emerged through not only war but also what we will call "everyday militarism." Organized thematically according to photographic subjects, this course will closely investigate selected bodies of photographic work with readings on war, atrocities, subjectivity, ethics, and iconicity. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Organized thematically, with examples drawn from painting, sculpture, photography, film, popular culture and mixed media installations, we examine how the deployment, manipulations and construction of the signification of the asexualized mammy complex is juxtaposed against the jezebel vixen in a shifting terrain from the antebellum era through the post-racial decade of the 21st century. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD.

   <COURSEDESC>Landscape architects and designers in other disciplines are taking an increasingly important role in addressing complex questions related to climate change and natural hazards.  These questions involve intersecting cultural and scientific issues.  This course is designed to equip landscape architects and other designers with an essential foundation in physical and social scientific aspects of climate change so that they may better engage with these questions.  Although it is impossible to cover the breadth of necessary topics and issues in a single semester, students will learn to analyze and access the scientific literature so that they can individually extend their education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emphasis will also be placed on essential skills and disciplinary approaches to enable more effective collaboration in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts.  This includes addressing cultural and disciplinary differences in approaches to scientific concepts such as validity and uncertainty, and examining epistemological aspects of science.  This course is an essential primer in climate change and natural hazards for any student who hopes to address these issues in their work or to work in policy based contexts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open undergraduates only; sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2012; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and junior students. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or THAD. William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Also offered as THAD-C221; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley ("Transformation"), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (&lt;i&gt;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&lt;/i&gt;), Conrad ("The Secret Sharer"), and Lawrence.   &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL POETRY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Visual Poetry has been defined by Willard Bohn as "poetry that is meant to be seen." There are traditions of visual poetry in many cultures, ancient, modern, and contemporary, and because meaning is invested in pattern, color, dimension, texture, graphics, image, and animation as well as in the word, these poems can communicate whether or not you understand the language they are written in, and in many more ways than linear narrative. In a sense, visual poetry is language's own disappearing trick. This courses introduces students to cross-cultural traditions of visual poetry, including pattern poetry, illumination, concrete poetry, and what digital poet and theorist David Jhave Johnston calls TAVs (textaudio- visual poems) and TAVITs (text-audio-visual-interactive poems). Particular attention will be paid to contemporary practitioners, and to relationships between material traditions of poetry including sound, visual, and digital. Students will build knowledge; compose and publish visual poems; and write and present a research paper. Texts and references may include Dick Higgins, A Short History of Pattern Poetry, William Blake, Songs of Innocence &amp; of Experience, Adam Pendleton, Black Dada Reader, Crag Hill and Nico Vassilakis, The Last Vispo Anthology: Visual Poetry 1998-2008; works by Willard Bohn, Emmett Williams, Mary Ellen Solt, Johanna Drucker; and the archive ubuweb.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE: ALIENS IN SCIENCE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There are few things that represent the non-human better than the alien. Not of this world, often not even humanoid, the alien serves as the ultimate Other-something that does not belong, something that is different in a fundamental way, something that is often unknowable, something completely and utterly foreign. Gary Westfahl writes that "aliens are both metaphors and real possibilities" (16). As fundamentally non-human, though sometimes humanoid, the alien acts as a mirror to humanity, showing us the best, though more often, the worst of our own impulses. Aliens can be used to look inward, to probe the nature of humanity and thereby illustrate and comment upon human impulses, morals, and values. However, the ubiquity of aliens across media demonstrate that "humans also crave companionship in a vast, cold universe and aliens may represent hopeful, compensatory images of the strange friends we have been unable to find" (Westfahl 16). Symbolically, this plays out in a number of ways. The alien might represent an Other based on gender, sexuality, or race. The alien might be friendly, here to help mankind, opportunistic, here to plunder our natural resources, or downright evil, bent on eating, incubating in, or wiping out our civilization. This class will examine a number of Science Fiction works that feature aliens, from Octavia Butler, H.G. Wells, and C.J. Cherryh, to films by Ridley Scott, Steven Speilberg, and Neill Blomkamp. We will also draw on a number of theoretical authors, from Barbara Creed and Julia Kristeva, to Gary Westfahl and Darko Suvin.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Literature is one facet of culture.  The significance of literature can be best understood in terms of the culture for which it springs, and the purpose is clear only when the reader understands and accepts the assumptions on which literature is based" (Paula Gunn Allen-Laguna Sioux poet). This course will explore value systems and aesthetics that are from very diverse Native cultures, focusing on the ways in which indigenousness relates to literature and storytelling. The critical methodologies developed by Native critics such as Gerald Vizenor  (Anishinaabe writer and scholar), and Craig Womack (Muscogee Creek-Cherokee author and professor of Native Studies) will enable us to study Native frameworks and new ways to regard literature/histories. We will explore questions such as can Native American theory/literature transform or challenge non-Native critical theoretical strategies. Our discussions, which may take a variety of directions, will also examine such issues as American Indian identities and communities as well as the impact of colonization on tribal peoples.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IRISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Ireland has a long history of literature, stretching from pre-Christian epics through monastic manuscripts right up to the thriving contemporary scene. While there are many important Irish writers before the beginning of the twentieth century, clearly the birth of the Abbey theatre and the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the prose of James Joyce created reverberations still felt in Ireland today. Using Joyce, Synge, and Yeats as a beginning point, in this seminar we will look at a series of contemporary Irish writers whose work builds upon the foundation established in the early years of the twentieth century. One of the themes we will return to again and again in this course is the theme of loss - loss of language, loss of sovereignty, loss of loved ones.  What does Stephen mean when he says, "History is a Nightmare from which I am trying to awake"?  Why is Yeats left in "the foul rag and bone shop of the heart"?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

For this reason, our inquiry will pay particular attention to topics such as tradition, colonialism, and gender politics in Algeria, Egypt, Palestine, and Lebanon.

   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of &lt;I&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/I&gt; reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL LITERARY MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the last decades, modernist studies has moved far beyond its initial focus on a group of male Anglo-American High Modernists writing between 1890 and 1940. What the field now refers to as modernisms encompass popular and elite forms alike, some emphasizing stylistic form and others not, authored by men and women of diverse racial and national identities, class backgrounds, and political affiliations. Like modernity, which modernism is generally seen to respond to, modernism viewed on a global scale has appeared unevenly and irregularly across time and geographic space and thus defies periodization. This course will survey global literary modernisms from a comparative perspective, attending to how the notions of the world and the modern are engaged in texts by such authors as Charles Baudelaire (France), Joseph Conrad (England), Bertolt Brecht (Germany), Anna Akhmatova (Russia), Constantine Cavafy (Greece), Rabindranath Tagore (India), Jean Rhys (Dominican Rep.), Nella Larsen (U.S.), Jorge Luiz Borges (Argentina), Aim Cesar (Martinique), Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar (Turkey), Eileen Chang (China), and others.  </COURSEDESC>

What are some of the assumptions and desires that animate the relationship between theatre, performance, and politics? How has this relationship been practiced, understood and theorized over time, and most importantly, in contemporary circumstances? What relationship does political theatre have with the local, the national and the transnational? This course seeks to approach these questions through readings that may include works by Sophocles, Brecht, Heaney, Boal, Friel, Churchill, Edgar, Tendulkar, Soyinka, Fusco, Deavere Smith, Pinter and Nottage along with relevant theoretical texts. Screenings might include videos related to recent US presidential elections, musical and artistic performances, and acts of contemporary culture jamming activists like "The Yes Men."&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE ENVIRONMENT THROUGH COMICS AND GRAPHIC LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Taking its cue from Clint Eastwood who proclaimed, "As far as I'm concerned, Americans don't have any original art except Western movies and jazz," this course will analyze the Western film as an art form in and of itself. We will discuss Westerns in terms of their specific aesthetic and technological influence on the medium, their cultural expression of a national political unconscious, and their global function as the meta-narrative of space. This course will tackle these discussions through a chronological unfolding of the genre starting with the Edison Company's 1898 Westerns and Edwin S. Porter's &lt;i&gt;The Great Train Robbery (1903)&lt;/i&gt; through the Golden Age of John Ford and Howard Hawks' films and the reciprocal translation of Akira Kurosawa's epics, and finally, to the variants of the Spaghetti, Revisionist, and genre-bending contemporary and postmodern Westerns of Dennis Hopper, Sam Peckinpah, John Sayles, Jim Jarmusch, Ang Lee, and Wim Wenders. There will be required readings in critical film theory, weekly screenings, analytical essays, and oral presentations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED POETRY WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Advanced Poetry Workshop is an intensive project-based poetry workshop for students with previous workshop experience and a portfolio of revised work on which to build. The course centers on workshop: peer critique by students with previous practice in poetry writing, and the shared goal of completing a semester-long publication/performance project. Students are expected to have a strong commitment to active participation in contemporary poetry as readers, writers, curators, performers, and audience. Teaching and learning methodologies include close reading of exemplary texts, experimentation with forms, revision, online/print publication, and performance. Texts will include poetry collections published in 2019 and 2020, as selected by students and instructor. The workshop welcomes work in any language and from any tradition of poetry. To the greatest extent possible, the work should speak for itself. But mediation, translation, contextualization also play a vital role.  &lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite: LAS-E411 Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop, or equivalent experience.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: LAS-E412: Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRANSRACIAL BODIES, TRANSRACIAL SELVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thanks to the work and lives of transgender people, we now have room to understand our bodies in radically unbounded ways. Technological advances in surgery, hormonal therapy, psychiatry, cultural warfare, are catching up to the transgender presence: the gendered body is not necessarily that with which we were born, but one that can be crafted to match the real body of our psyche, our dreams. However, one's racial self remains tethered to biology. Blackness, Whiteness, Asianness, Latinness, the whole rainbow of racial identification, is still construed as biologically inescapable and inevitable. To speak of "transracialism" is to evoke self-delusion and community betrayal.  But this cultural reaction is contrary to the everyday experience that actually finds racial identification as a process that is always transracial: declaring ourselves racially, we all cross restricted zones in becoming ourselves.  In this course, we will use the discourse of transgenderism to build an alternate vocabulary of race. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: NATURAL HISTORY: LOCAL, GLOBAL, ANALOG, DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar has two primary goals:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. To engage critically with natural history as a literary and visual art form and with its history as a scientific practice.  &lt;BR&gt; 2. To collaborate on projects and experiments that employ digital and analog methods for analyzing, interpreting, archiving, curating, and creating visual and literary works of natural history. Throughout the semester, we will visit local museums, labs, archives, and field sites to facilitate these goals.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Natural history is a crucial genre for understanding the origins of modern environmentalism, the history of science, discourses of race, and the nature of European imperialism. As an artistic and epistemological practice, natural history enjoyed the height of its popularity during the early modern and enlightenment periods, as European explorers, traders, and colonizers endeavored to classify, catalog, explain, and exploit the diverse flora and fauna all over the planet. In the process, they encountered (and often ignored or stole from) the complex folk biology of various indigenous cultures. Especially in the Americas, natural historical knowledge production depended on the collaboration of various cultures within profoundly uneven power dynamics: European explorers and creolized American naturalists, political leaders and ordinary citizens, amateur collectors and professional theorists, men and women, slaveholders and enslaved people, and Euro-colonial traders and indigenous Americans. Furthermore, early naturalists were polymaths --scientists, philosophers, political leaders, artists, writers, collectors, and traders --before the stratification of the modern sciences into disciplines that took place during the nineteenth century. As science became a more professional and specialized endeavor, natural history evolved into various forms of amateur field science, environmental art, and nature writing, an evolution this course will actively examine through reading, conversation, and practice. As such, our course materials will range from classical antiquity to the present and cover a large variety of written forms and artistic mediums.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: BLACK WOMEN RUIN EVERYTHING: SLAVES, ALIENS AND GHOSTS IN PURSUIT OF A BETTER WORLD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is grounded in two premises. The first is that the world is founded on anti-blackness and the second is that black feminist authors write with an awareness of this fact and the desire to imagine this world otherwise. Focusing on works of speculative fiction such as Octavia Butler's Dawn and Toni Morrison's Beloved, as well as less easily classifiable texts such as Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters and Phyllis Alesia Perry's Stigmata, this course considers how the use of non-realist elements in realist (protest fiction and neo-slave narratives) and non-realist (such as afro-futurism) genres serve as important means of both critiquing the gendered anti-blackness that affects black women's life chances and imagining a future not predicated on simply enrolling black being in the existing hierarchies of human being. Put otherwise, this course will investigate how black feminist writers have used speculative fiction and/or elements of speculative fiction to attempt to image not only their own freedom but also the freedom of all beings arranged within the social and political hierarchies built upon their backs.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL ENGLISHES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar attempts to do two things: first, we examine the global careers of the English language and the literatures written in it from their period of ascendance during the height of British colonialism in the late-19th century to their proliferation in the postcolonial present to argue for a concept of multiple "Englishes" in place of one dominant, normative, authentic 'English';second, we explore the hypothesis that the discourse of "Global Englishes" is not just constituted in writing and literature as most scholars have argued but also through everyday performance, and often through spoken forms. So, a discussion of the cultural politics of speaking and listening across different sonic media will supplement the regular study of selected fiction, nonfiction, plays, poetry, films, television, and music. Topics discussed will include variations in the uses of literary English, translations and adaptations, varieties of spoken Englishes, accents and code-switching, multilingualism in literary texts, etc. Historical and theoretical contexts will include colonialism and postcolonialism, economic and cultural globalization, identity politics, exile and migration, literary prizes, circulation and readership, etc. Not surprisingly, most of the authors we will read are from ex-colonies of the British Empire which now have thriving English language literary and cultural traditions of their own, like India and Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa, Canada and Australia, Ireland and the Caribbean region. Since the United Kingdom's and the United States' Englishes, even though dominant, are still part of 'the global' we will read some representative texts from Scotland or Wales, for instance, as well as "US ethnic literatures." Authors may include Rudyard Kipling, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, G V Desani, Salman Rushdie, J M Coetzee, Jean Rhys, Wole Soyinka, Michle Lalonde, Derek Walcott, Brian Friel, Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Mohsin Hamid, M. NourbeSe Philip, Irvine Welsh, Caroline Bergvall, and Junot Diaz. Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: PRE-COLONIAL TO CONTEMPORARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This travel course is a cross-disciplinary collaboration between HPSS and THAD; the THAD component addresses colonial, modern, and contemporary arts in several regions of Mexico, including Mexico City, where we will view murals by Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, and Jos Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo's house and museum, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and the world-renowned Museo de Antropologa; Puebla, known for its ceramics production and its ties to early colonial commerce, as well as nearby Cholula with its many colonial churches; Veracruz, a port city distinctive for its ties to the Caribbean and as a site of the importation of enslaved Africans; and Mrida, the most culturally active city in the Yucatn Peninsula, with access to several early and classic Maya archaeological sites, as well as a vibrant contemporary arts scene.  &lt;br&gt; The THAD portion of the course will cover the colonial, modern, and contemporary periods in terms of artistic, architectural, and visual production, considering how indigenous pre-colonial techniques and traditions (addressed in the HPSS portion of the course) are revived, reinvented, and synthesized with European, African, and Asian styles, materials, and practices.  &lt;br&gt; Prior to leaving for Mexico, the students will be given a illustrated lecture with an overview of Mexico's past cultural and political history, including the development of major civilizations throughout Mexico, the conquest of the region by the Spanish in the 16th c., the Mexican revolution, and the current political structure of the country. During our travel, each site visit will be accompanied by a brief contextual introduction orienting the students to the site's contributions to Mexico's history and cultural context.  &lt;bR&gt; The course hopes to not only inform students about the culture and history of our neighbors to the South, but also give them knowledge and an appreciation for the many contributions that Mexican past civilizations and contemporary Mexican culture have provided globally, and continue to bring to us. We also hope that our traveling students will learn about group dynamics, develop sensitivity towards a culture that might be foreign to them, be willing to explore a host of new traditions, acquire new knowledge, and discard possible stereotypes and preconceptions about an American region to which so many of our US citizens and immigrants have a connection to.  &lt;br&gt; For the THAD portion of the course, students will be required to write two short papers (3 pages, double-spaced) that reflect upon the readings and/or the sites visited. They should be focused, organized responses that include a clear thesis (or guiding idea) rather than being a stream-of-conscious response, but may incorporate personal reflections, impressions, and opinions. The course will conclude with a focused, researched response (5-7 pages) that engages with some aspect of Mexican art, architecture, or visual culture, from the pre-colonial period to the present day. It may incorporate personal reflections and impressions, but it should reference and cite specific texts that we have read in the course, as well as artworks and/or sites we have visited during our trip. Papers will be due after our return from Mexico.  &lt;br&gt; Students' grades will take into account their participation and inquisitiveness in/about the various site visits, as well as their level of inquiry and critical engagement demonstrated in their written responses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for THAD-W135 and HPSS-W235. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course.

   <COURSEDESC>We are so familiar with these three hot drinks but they became commodities and part of our everyday only recently. This course explores what values were attached to these plants before the era of industrialized production, i.e. before ca. 1800. We will survey how Westerners adopted these beverages by looking at medical theories, the issue of morality, and the expansion of sugar production. We will also study how the craving for these products reinforced or even spurred slavery in French, Dutch, and English colonies. Special attention is dedicated to how ritual behavior affects design in terms of the sociability around these beverages, required manners, and the tableware crafted for them. The methodology is based on the analysis of images, discussions of assigned readings, written responses, visits to museums (RISD and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), and touring the facility of a chocolate artisan.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the body as subject, object, medium, and lens. This class is intended as both a discussion of the shifting role of the human form as represented and implicated in artwork from nineteenth century to the present day, as well as an experiential interrogation of our own somatic experience as scholars, artists, and humans, in order to ask the question: what does the body have to teach us? We will address the discourses of the imaged and imagined body prior to and through European modernism as a carrier of meaning and an object to be consumed, with particular attention to the ramifications of the Cartesian mind-body distinction. From this starting point, we will track shifts and the development of alternate theories of the body from psychology, philosophy, critical theory, and neuroscience, from the nineteenth century into present day. In addition to theory and philosophy, we will address how these shifts are manifest in artwork of the twentieth century from painting, sculpture installation art, video, and augmented reality art. Students will be asked to be mindful of their own somatic (bodily) practices, including movement inside and outside class with the intention of developing a deeper understanding the body as lens for experience and production.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POWER, DEPENDENCE AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN EARLY MODERN VISUAL CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the visual culture of social welfare and justice during the early modern era (1500-1900). A powerful guild of silk manufacturers sponsored the construction of the first large-scale orphanage for abandoned children in Renaissance Florence, employing architects, painters, woodworkers and sculptors. "Talking statues" in Rome advocated for the end of oppressive taxation by over-zealous popes.  Printmakers across Europe turned out satirical woodcuts and engravings that graphically argued for better living conditions and labor laws in the age of industrialization.  Josiah Wedgewood issued a plaque that poignantly pleaded for the abolishment of slavery.  Here, we study a broad range of imagery, objects and architecture that forged a language of social justice that still exists today.  Drawing on the rich collections of the RISD Museum, Fleet Library Special Collections and the John Hay Library at Brown, among others, we examine the role of patrons, artists and designers in advocating for, and advancing, social welfare in an increasingly urban and educated society.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMERICAN PRINTS: ARTISTS AND MASTER PRINTERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The 1960s saw the expansion of the art market in the US when printmaking workshops emerged on the coasts and in the heartland. Artists and master printers worked collaboratively at ULAE, Tamarind, Gemini GEL, Tyler Graphics and others, and such presses also editioned artists' prints for sale via the gallery system. Importantly such workshops also offered an opportunity to artists primarily committed to other media to explore various printmaking methods. Collaboration among artists and printmakers thus became a hallmark of the so-called American Printmaking Renaissance. The course will investigate the nature of collaboration between artists and master printers as we study prints by epoch-making artists including Louise Nevelson, Jasper Johns, Robert Rauschenberg, Helen Frankenthaler, Richard Diebenkorn, Ed Ruscha, Vija Celmins, as well as lesser-known artists who contributed significantly to the popularity of prints.Technical innovation continued in the era of Pop with the use of commercial techniques by Warhol, Rosenquist and Lichtenstein, and continues today with the use of digital media. We will draw upon the collection of the RISD museum to develop an intimate understanding of the role of innovation and collaboration in American printmaking ca. 1960-1990. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DEBATING IMPRESSIONISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While impressionism once inspired some of the most innovative thinking in art history, overexposure has blunted its edge. This seminar seeks to recover what impressionism meant to its time, and to ask what it could mean to ours. After a brief introduction to the major figures (Degas, Manet, Monet, Morisot, etc.), discussion will be organized around a series of debates in the history and reception of French impressionism. Was impressionism a loosely affiliated group of individuals or a coherent movement? Did it extend prior traditions or radically break with the past? Was it objective or subjective? Was it feminist or misogynistic? Was it anarchist, republican, or socialist - and why think about its politics at all? Students will learn strategies for making arguments about paintings, both as material things and as historical artifacts. Readings will focus on primary sources (Baudelaire, Mallarm, Zola, etc.), stressing how new movements in art influenced criticism - and visa versa. We will supplement these readings with select secondary sources of methodological interest, especially landmark texts in social, feminist, and technical art history. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND TRAUMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the discourse art and trauma. It beings with a history of trauma studies, with its roots in Holocaust studies, Freudian interpretation, and the discipline of Psychology. It ventures on to explore the ramifications of understanding trauma in the realm of imag(in)ing suffering, whether represented through journalism, popular media, or artistic representation. We will interrogate how the models posited by trauma theory hold up in the age of new media. A recurrent motif in the class will be what it means to study trauma and its representation, both abstractly and personally, ethically and psychosomatically, and establish practices for maintaining sustainable and responsible modes of inquiry.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the myth and cultural importance placed on spaces and objects occupied and used by the so-called "geniuses" of American history alongside our general romantic interest in "the genius" as a cultural phenomenon. We will examine the designed objects and spaces of famous American artists and heroes - places such as Graceland, Dollywood, and Marfa; objects like Thomas Jefferson's writing desk; and museums created out of the homes of Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain, among others. In an attempt to unpack and understand the importance of objects in both memory- and identity-making, we will consider how visual and material objects both communicate personality and legacy and how they act as mediators between each "genius" and their audiences, allowing visitors to come into contact with the imaginative worlds of their heroes.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCOCO ROCKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A key moment and place in the history of design, eighteenth-century art was innovative and rich in criticism, especially in France. Favored themes in the graphic arts and sculpture include gallantry (fetes galantes), eroticism, and domesticity. French art dealers were responsible for new designs for furniture and decorative arts; architects developed utopian projects; and seamstresses launched extravagant fashion trends. We will examine how rococo came to be the dominant artistic trend in all Europe and the kinds of controversy that it generated from the mid-century on. Rococo Rocks will provide analytical tools for understanding the visual arts within their social and critical contexts including the Enlightenment. We will navigate between genres and media, assess how works of art were then perceived, and discuss the position of women (whether mothers, wives, or artists). We will also study the ramifications of rococos continuing curve into twentieth-century art from Art Nouveau to Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons.&lt;BR&gt;   Visits to several departments of the RISD Museum are planned as well as to the Hay Library where we will study original eighteenth-century illustrations. Students final projects consist in designing a rococo-inspired object in any medium (painting, sculpture, textile, print, or drawing) accompanied by an artists statement.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

Studying primarily some of his surviving 6000 drawings and notes, the course will locate his aesthetic and analytical processes and contexts for a broad range of projects, such as paintings, sculptures, treatise literature, machines, weapons, maps, festivals, built environments, and studies of natural philosophy. We will also examine theoretical pursuits in the liberal and technical arts by Leonardo and his contemporaries, and their assessments of visual art as a science, and studies of natural science as a systematic art. Particularly informative will be Leonardo's responses to contemporary trends, to artisanal traditions, to the antique, to members of princely courts and republics, and more generally to investigative and inventive strategies.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The study of the place of art in such a multicultural society has implications for the interpretation of art's role in the modern world.  This course will discuss the way Alexander and his successors controlled their image in art and the styles of sculpture, painting, architecture, and urban planning that were precipitated by the socio-political changes brought about by his conquests.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRUE CRIME</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Crime is terribly revealing," Agatha Christie wrote in her 1936 novel "The ABC Murders." In the genre known as "True Crime" - which, unlike Christie's novels, deals with real events -- there is a long and colorful history of examining crimes to see what, exactly, they reveal. This class is an introduction to this genre through classic texts (Truman Capote's "In Cold Blood", the Library of America's True Crime anthology), texts that challenge conventions (Rick Geary's graphic novel, "The Borden Tragedy"; Moises Kaufman's stage play, "The Laramie Project"), and texts that spill over in other media, including documentary film, television, radio, and photography.  Over the course of the term, students will not only become familiar with most famous crimes in American history -- recognizable by names like Manson and "O.J." -- but they will also explore the role crime plays in the history of a state that some call "Rogue's Island." Most importantly, the course is an opportunity for students to wrestle with the questions that the best True Crime stories pose. What is a crime? What is justice? And why are we perennially drawn to these stories?</COURSEDESC>

The course will introduce students to the neighborhood and its history. Students will be invited to develop and design research and archival programs that respond to questions about community, diversity, access, inclusion, and connection. Students will be introduced to the landscape of community organizations and institutions that might participate in these programs. Students will also engage in their own research project using scholarly best practices to build a mini-archive around a specific individual or individuals, institution or institutions, or which respond to specific questions of race, diversity, immigration, ethnicity, and class using the project site as a primary lens of examination. Students will engage in readings of history and historiography that question the shaping of history and history-telling, the role of power and authority in the construction of history, and current questions about tourism, consumerism, development and gentrification, and community in contemporary history-telling. The outcomes of the coursework will emphasize the development of understanding and skill in scholarly historical research, narrative design, and the history and historiography of placemaking.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*PORTUGAL: MAPPING PORTUGAL: BIO-GEO CULTURAL HERITAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Located on the western edge of the Iberian Peninsula, Portugal contains a wide range of socio-ecological regions and configurations, including large cityscapes, western and southern Atlantic coasts, mountainous regions, agricultural landscapes, marine ecologies, petrocultural landscapes, and tourist infrastructures.  In addition to these complexly-layered contemporary socio-ecologies, Portugal has many richly-layered built environments, with cultural heritage sites dating from the pre-historic to the contemporary.  Portugal's historical and contemporary socio-ecologies emerge from both historical and contemporary geopolitics, but also, at least in part, from its varied geological contexts.  Students in the co-requisite, integrated liberal arts and studio courses that comprise "Mapping Portugal: Bio-Geo-Cultural Heritages" will spend four weeks in Portugal and will use the methodologies of design for the built environment, the fine arts, the environmental humanities, mapping, and writing to investigate overlapping networks of biological, geological, and cultural heritage in Portugal, with a focus on the Alentejo and Algarve regions. The course begins and ends in Lisbon, but focuses primarily on sites to the south and east of Lisbon around four three different bases: Setubal/Sines/Alccer do Sal, vora, Mrtola /Serpa, and Faro.  By staying for extended periods in each of these areas, students will be able to focus their studies on the specific socio-ecologies and heritage sites surrounding each base.  By the course end, students will be able to link them together into a comprehensive understanding of the bio-geo-cultural heritages and networks of the Alentejo and Algarve.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAEL-W512 and INTAR-1512. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;BR&gt;Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.

This will be paired with readings on racial identity formation in the United States; racial identity in museum practice; reconciliation/repair projects that have been initiated by museums, activists and communities; the intersection of wealth, privilege, politics and collecting; interpreting racial identity in museums; and the work of activist/artist curators like Fred Wilson and museum activist groups like #MuseumsRespondToFerguson.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through the course students will: &lt;BR&gt; .	Learn the principles of critical race theory and the history of race in America &lt;BR&gt; .	Be trained in how to facilitate race dialogues &lt;BR&gt; .	Delve into the RISD Museum's collection in search of items that can be used to generate thoughtful race dialogues &lt;BR&gt; .	Gain a deeper understanding of the history of curatorial work and how racial identity can affect curatorial practice &lt;BR&gt; .	Attempt new ways of seeing, understanding and tagging old objects in the museum's collection - part of their mid-session assignment &lt;BR&gt; .	Think critically about museum collecting practices and what types of repair work may be needed &lt;BR&gt; .	Propose new exhibitions that engage in the power/challenge of racial identity and the possibility of repair.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A Collaborative Study Project (CSP) allows two students to work collaboratively to complete a faculty supervised project of independent study. &lt;br&gt; Usually, a CSP is supervised by two faculty members, but with approval it may be supervised by one faculty member. Its purpose is to meet individual student needs by providing an alternative to regularly offered courses, though it is not a substitute for a course if that course is regularly offered.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN QUEER FILM, 1990-2018</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on the intersectionalities of race and queer subjectivities in queer cinema. We will trace this development from the historical cinematic 1990s of New Queer Cinema (NQC), an era that encompasses an explosion of "gay film visibility," to an exploration of present day queer cinema and the ways in which queer representations and queer identities are portrayed. We will study the stylistic developments and controversies of queer film, examining major innovations and changes as compared to films from the NQC era. Such questions as what's at stake in films that contest and re-imagine new queer subjectivities will be addressed during the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCKUMENTARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Visions of youthful utopia in Monterey Pop (1968) give way to violence and mayhem in Gimmie Shelter (Rolling Stones, 1970). Martin Scorsese offers an epilogue to an era in The Last Waltz (The Band, 1978). Madonna sells herself in Truth or Dare (1991) and Metallica undergoes group therapy in Some Kind of Monster (2004). Rock documentaries are as much about the social and political state of America as they are about music and musicians. In this course, we will explore the visual language and cultural history of the rockumentary film genre. Topics for discussion will include: documentary and cinema Veriti narrative forms; the troubled notion of documentary "truth"; music as commercial product; fandom and the cult of celebrity; and the rise of MTV. Students should be prepared to participate in class discussion, attend film screenings, complete critical readings, and hone their analytical writing skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHORT STORY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this writing workshop, we will explore the short story form, working to put into words what we-as individual readers-hope to find in it. We will consider what makes a story a story, while acknowledging that it is often something ineffable, indefinable. We will read from a range of writers, including Alice Munro, Donald Barthelme, Roberto Bolao, and Vladimir Nabokov. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to writing exercises and peer workshops. At the end of the term, students will be expected to submit a portfolio comprised of informal reading responses, writing exercises, and completed stories.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE COOKBOOK: THE RHETORIC OF RECIPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The Cookbook: The Rhetoric of Recipes" is a course designed to look at the form and rhetoric of cookbooks. Cookbooks are their own distinct genre. There are rules that must be followed, though the range of possibilities are multitudinous. A cookbook entirely about bugs? Sure. A cookbook on gelatin desserts? In the 1960s there were dozens. But a cookbook ostensibly is both tantalizing and informative. It aims to make the reader want to eat the dish that it introduces, and it gives clear instruction about how to produce that dish. The course begins by looking medieval recipes, many of them found online at Cooking in the Archive. From there the course moves to looking at the culinary essays of Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynire and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the founders of culinary writing. Then we move to MFK Fisher and James Beard, before looking at Julia Child and Jacques Pepin and the rise of the celebrity chef. In the course students will be asked to deconstruct recipes. What makes a recipe successful? The rhetoric of cookbooks is an art, just as is poetry or memoir writing. Some cookbooks are literature, others are pulp. Over the course of five weeks, students will begin to learn how to create a recipe that both instructs and entices. They will learn how personality enters a cookbook, and how something like Marcus Samuelsson's The Soul of a New Cuisine is ultimately more about the writer than the recipes. By the course's end, each student will produce their own cookbook.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FREAKS, QUEENS, MINSTRELS, AND SPECTACLES OF THE HUMAN BODY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will be looking at various displays of the human body, focusing on four main arenas: the freak show, the minstrel show, the drag show, and the human zoo. We will focus extensively on the 19th and early 20th centuries, the heyday of human exhibitions, and move forward to current modes of display, which both contest and refigure earlier spectacles. Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*GUYANA: EXPLORING ART &amp; SCIENCE OF BIODIVERSITY IN GUYANA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation, located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. More specifically, this course offers RISD students the opportunity to visit a biological hotspot and consider its role in society; participate in conservation science field research; interact cross-culturally; and develop their communication skills. Taught collaboratively, this course emphasizes the importance of connecting ideas, information, and methodologies across the arts, humanities, and sciences, with an emphasis on biology. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAS-W717 and SCI-W097. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental &amp; Foundation Studies. &lt;br&gt; 2019WS Travel Cost: $4,225.00 - airfare included.  &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ITALY: SEE NAPLES AND DIE: PANORAMA AND THE POETICS OF A CITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Vedi Napoli e poi muori ("See Naples and then die") was a common expression, echoed most famously on his grand tour by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, to identify Naples as the most naturally and artistically beautiful city in the world; so beautiful that one needn't look upon anything else after seeing it. Few cities embody the Empedoclean elementality of Naples: situated in a volcanic landscape dominated by Mount Vesuvius, beside an enormous bay and natural harbor that opens onto the Tyrrhenian Sea under an endless sky, it marks a dramatic convergence of earth, wind, water and fire.  The art, literature, history, politics and economics of Naples are equally "elemental" in the way that their constitutive and conflicting cultural forces are manifest in a dynamic, frequently paradoxical system of social relations.   &lt;br&gt; Students will engage this compelling city and its environment through the twinned graphic practices of drawing and writing, with particular attention given to the mediums of panoramic landscape, scientific illustration, philosophical speculation and fictional narrative.  The LAS component of the course will survey literary discourses from antiquity to the present that imagine Naples and its environment.  Readings (in English translation) will consist of selections by Virgil, Pliny (Elder and Younger), Livy, Tomasso Campanella, Giambattista Vico, Giacomo Leopardi, Matilde Serao and Walter Benjamin.  The primary texts around which the course will be built are Susan Sontag's Volcano Lover, Roberto Saviano's Gomorrah, and contemporary Neapolitan noir fiction.  Students will have read and written on Volcano Lover before convening in Naples, after which work will commence on a term project produced in tandem with travel and studio projects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must plan and register for LAS-W725 and LDAR-W625. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.5 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course.
