   <COURSETITLE>EHP ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C503.

   <COURSETITLE>WRITING ABOUT ART AS A PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys art writing across times and genres -- it treats writing as a kind of performance art. Each kind of writing about art demonstrates (or "performs") certain skills and syntaxes to a historically situated audience. Students will inquire into many and diverse rhetorics (or "performance strategies"), from key texts in academic art history to blogs and videos, critical exhibition reviews to socio-theoretical manifestos about art and culture. Students will apply writing techniques to works of art / design / architecture / visual culture that sustain their interests.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Junior and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will explore artworks and art-collectives which aim to share in a social activity since the 1990s.  Nicolas Bourriaud's theory argued in &lt;I&gt;Relational Aesthetics&lt;/I&gt; (1998, English translation 2002), as well as those of his critics will provide context.  Additionally we will examine public-facing, artist-run projects, with roots not only in everyday life but also in the specifics of local communities as we chart art and activism in contemporary social environments. The course will conclude by investigating the artist-as-entrepreneur model, and its place within social innovation and the cultural sector.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will ask: How have private spaces been defined with objects? How have objects mediated relationships among friends and family? How have objects acted as repositories of intimate memory? Among the topics we will consider are: miniature painting; hair jewelry; death masks and casts from the living body; early photography; furniture and sociability; the history of the album; the private museum.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the visual culture pertinent to Sigmund Freud and his contemporaries in turn-of-the-century Vienna. We shall look at the modernist art of Austrian painters such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, as well as the "minor" arts of illustration, photography, scientific imaging, and film in light of Freud's psychoanalytic ideas. Classes will be devoted to topics such as avant-garde postcard design, ethnographic photography, and scientific images including x-rays and surgical films.  The silent erotic "Saturn" films that were screened in Vienna from 1904-1910 will also be considered. Requirements include mid-term and final exams, two essays, and interest in the subject (no past experience needed).</COURSEDESC>

Our objective is to situate Contemporary Nigerian Art within the dialectics of modernism and postmodernism beginning first with the colonial implantation of the "modernist" trend in Africa. We examine the impact on the artistic vision and direction of the major artists in Africa, while highlighting the careers of their counterparts operating outside the continent within the postmodernist currents of Paris, New York, London, Berlin, etc.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Bronze Age saw the development of several advanced civilizations in the Mediterranean basin. Perhaps the best-known among these is the civilization of Pharaonic Egypt. This course will focus on the art and architecture of Egypt and their neighbors to the north: the Aegean civilizations known as Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean. While art historical study of these cultures will be emphasized, evidence for trade and other cultural interchange between them will also be discussed. The course will cover such topics as the Pyramids of Giza, the Tomb of Tutankhamun, and the Palace of Knossos.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INDIGENOUS ARCHITECTURE OF THE AMERICAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the architectural traditions of the Indigenous cultures of North America, Mesoamerica, and South America in historic perspective.  Examinations will focus on the critical cultural and environmental circumstances which led to the development of distinctive architectural styles throughout the Americas.  Approached from an anthropological/archaeological perspective, specific topics of discussion will include the following: construction methods and material choices, spatial arrangements and use areas, the relationship between physical and social community structure, and architectural manifestation of cultural belief systems.  Emphasis will also be placed on manipulations of the landscape in response to social and climatic needs.  Architectural culture discussed in this course will range widely in scale, dispersal and geography - from the igloo of a small Inuit hunting party to the entire Mayan city of Chichen Itza, to the terrace and irrigation systems of the Inca.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ART OF ART CONSERVATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How does a museum preserve its art collection? How do art and science reinforce each other in this field?  Does the approach to the conservation of ancient art differ from that of the conservation of contemporary art?  How and why do materials composing visual art deteriorate?  Which environmental factors adversely affect organic and inorganic materials first or fastest?  In this course, the student will gain an understanding for the five agents of deterioration, for issues of physical and chemical stability regarding organic and inorganic materials chosen by artists over the millennia, as well as how the care and handling of art differs in some respects for a museum than for a working artist.   Frequent visits through the museum exhibits, storage, and the conservation lab will demonstrate key concepts covered in the class.  Ethical issues regarding the determination of the original intent of any given artist as well as ethical issues regarding forgeries and looted art will be discussed.  Assignments will focus on the RISD Art Museum's collection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Restricted to HAVC concentrators or MA candidates in Museum Education&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD TEXTILES: TRADE, TRADITIONS, TECHNIQUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology across Asia, Africa and the Americas will be explored utilizing the RISD Museum of Art with frequent visits to the textile and costume collections. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Students will also have opportunities to examine various methods of textile display, analysis and storage appropriate to items of cultural heritage via case studies of specific objects in the RISD Museum.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be preregistered by the department&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IDENTITY IN FLUX: PHOTO PORTRAITURE FROM DAGUERROTYPE TO SELFIE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the history of photographic portraiture since the "invention" of the medium in the 1830s up to the present day. Particular attention is given to exploring the ways that identity is created, reinforced, or deconstructed through the limits and capacity of photography. How does photography transform the way identity is constructed through imagery in the early years of its history? How has photography shaped the formation of subjectivity in portraiture? In what ways does photography challenge or reinforce cultural and political hegemony by "representing" a person? How have digital photography and social media transformed the ways that an identity is constructed and shared by others? To answer these questions, examples of photo portraiture, from vernacular to artistic modes and spanning the globe, will be assessed. Each class will focus on theoretical debates on identity and subjectivity in relation to the given topic, with an interdisciplinary approach incorporating art history, cultural studies, critical theory, memory studies, postcolonial theory, and area studies. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599. Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm. MML &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This survey course focuses on the history of landscapes in the pre-industrialized world. Landscapes will be considered as an evolving condition, even when their defining characteristics were conceived and built at a specific point in time.  Critical to this course will be the establishment of frameworks for historical inquiry, the refinement of research methodologies, in the development of multiple perspectives through which to question and understand the design environment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Art History credit for Landscape Architecture majors required; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors on a space available basis.

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN PHYSICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Hollywood films:  how are they "written" by directors, performers, scriptcrafters, cameramen and producers?  We will view a selection of films featuring directors who stamped Hollywood and us with their visions, often from other cultures.  We will also study the direction Hollywood took in interpreting the Depression, War, and Recovery, and the direction stars, writers and designers chose in defining themselves.  This is a course in criticism, history and articulate appreciation.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed as an introduction to the 113-year history of the projected moving image (film, animation, and video). Artistic expression in these forms will be emphasized. Students discover new areas of interest while watching carefully selected examples of films and videos. During all classes, students will view films representing different styles and periods of filmmaking. About half of the classes are devoted to contemporary films. Critical thinking will be encouraged and fostered during classroom discussions. Clear expression of these thoughts will be developed through assigned readings and weekly writing assignments. During the semester, students learn about specific artists, schools of filmmaking, genres, and fields within the history of the film, animation, and video. Students also develop a common language by learning the meaning and proper usage of a glossary of common film terms. At select classes, film artists are present to introduce and discuss their work. Other guests include improvisational musicians who accompany silent films.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Registration priority to FAV majors&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO INSECT MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the form and function of the human body, with a focus on the musculoskeletal system and surface form. Each week, we will cover a different area of the body, working our way through the trunk and limbs to the neck and head. For each area, we will first consider the anatomical structure, including the bones, muscles, nerves, arteries and veins. We will then study the function, including movement, systems and processes. Each area will be further explored through common injuries and syndromes with an anatomical basis, which are illustrative of function through dysfunction. We will discuss treatments with an anatomical basis, including typical surgical approaches and procedures, and the design of prosthetics. Through this course, we will demystify and develop an appreciation for the wondrous  complexity of the human body and its role in art and design. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 Canterbury Tales), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt; ), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson.  </COURSEDESC>

What do poetic forms have to do with the ways that communities, selves, rights, nation-states and worlds have been reimagined in the modern period? Schools and movements will include: Imagism, Objectivism, the Harlem Renaissance, the Confessionalists, the Black Mountain School, the Beats, the New York School, the L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E poets, Conceptualism, Flarf, and experiments in New Media. We will also read from poets who seem to exceed easy categorization-Kathy Acker, Amiri Baraka, Sarah Blake, Cathy Park Hong, Susan Howe, Pamela Lu, Nathaniel Mackey, Fred Moten, Claudia Rankine, Lisa Robertson, Juliana Spahr and John Yau, among others. Rather than represent the range of practices that mark any historical moment, our goal throughout will be to trace particular lines, affiliations and antagonisms across moments within twentieth- and twenty-first century North American verse.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE DETECTIVE NOVEL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The game is afoot, so it is time to rely on the little grey cells. In this course we will examine the development of the detective novel in its three primary manifestations - the private eye novel, the procedural novel, and the amateur investigation. We will start out with some classic texts from Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, and Georges Simenon, then move to contemporary texts, paying particular attention to the way the genre adapts culturally as it moves from Europe and North America into Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The final project will be a collaborative writing project that will result in the class creating its own detective novel. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRECOCITY &amp; INNOCENCE: NARRATING CHILDREN'S CONSCIOUS IN 19TH &amp; 20TH CENTURY LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While children have long been objects of literary representation, the practice of depicting children's consciousness in imaginary literature intended for adults and the advent of literature devoted to captivating the imaginations of children both have relatively recent origins in the nineteenth century. In this course, we will read poems, short stories, and novels that privilege youthful subjectivity between 1850 and 1950 alongside contemporaneous debates about childhood, (im)maturity, and coming of age. We will ask what is at stake in the modern/ist enthusiasm for rendering children's minds in fiction. To what cultural, political, and discursive uses were children put during this period? What sorts of desires, aspirations, beliefs, and anxieties are disclosed by texts that emphasize "underage" modes of thinking and feeling? How can we understand the significance of childish fears, longings, capacities,and limitations within transatlantic culture in the decades leading up to and immediately following the turn of the twentieth century? We will consider the relationships between childhood and social institutions such as slavery, boarding school, and organized religion, examining how race, gender, socioeconomic status, and geography influenced (and often determined) the experience and duration of childhood in the United States and Britain. Throughout the semester, current theoretical frameworks such as queer temporalities, minor affect, and dependency will orient our discussions of the time and space inhabited by children, and nurtured or vitiated by their guardians, from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Can we prove that ghosts exist? Are aliens going to invade the earth? Will technology destroy humankind? What are scientists *really* experimenting on their laboratories? For centuries writers have explored the weird side of science in literature, exposing a cultural discomfort with scientific advancements and human interventions in nature. From Dr, Jekyll to Dr. Evil, scientists become villains threatening the population with their amoral desire to wield power over human life through experiments in bizarre pseudo-sciences such as mesmerism, vivification, parapsychology, and artificial intelligence. In this course we will read a variety of texts about these fascinating villains and the "weird sciences" they practice.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENVIRONMENTAL CASTASTROPHE IN FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Contemporary culture is filled with depictions of environmental catastrophe - films like &lt;I&gt;The Day After Tomorrow &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;Wall-E&lt;/I&gt; portray global disasters as obstacles for humanity to overcome on a path towards greater enlightenment, justice, and of course, survival.  But who is the villain in such stories?  Humanity?  Or a natural world that is portrayed as threatening our very existence?  In this class, we will examine how narratives of eco-disaster ask us to imagine the relationship between humans and their environment, and we will also investigate how historical disaster fictions have shaped contemporary depictions of environmental catastrophe.  What role do concerns of race, class, and gender play in the rhetoric of natural disasters?  We will consider both historical disaster narratives like Robert Barr's &lt;I&gt;The Doom of London&lt;/I&gt; and Richard Jefferies's &lt;I&gt;After London&lt;/I&gt;, as well as more contemporary fictions including Rachel Carson's &lt;I&gt;Silent Spring&lt;/I&gt;, Don Delillo's &lt;I&gt;White Noise&lt;/I&gt;, and the 2013 film &lt;I&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/I&gt;.   </COURSEDESC>

Is there progressive potential in the trend toward computerization? Or contrarily, in what ways might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO NONFICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>So much of the writing we encounter in the world falls under the umbrella of "nonfiction": memoirs, magazine articles, op-eds, travel narratives, celebrity profiles, true crime stories, biographies, personal essays, restaurant reviews, and more. This course offers an immersive introduction to the genre through reading, writing, and peer-editing assignments. Students will experiment with a number of different forms, including criticism, interviews, personal essays, and reportage. And they will also read the work of authors ranging from all-time masters like George Orwell and Joan Didion, to more contemporary luminaries like Roxane Gay, Ta-Nehisi Coates, and Sherman Alexie. By the end of the term, students will have not only gained a firm understanding of a branch of literature sometimes called the "art of fact," they will have also generated a substantial nonfiction portfolio of their own.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Such a project necessitates thinking about the book as flesh.  You will be asked to develop an intimacy with the book that will allow you to give it a different and differently true contours. &lt;br&lt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the vast, variegated field of critical theory. We will study the concepts, questions, and debates that have been central to understandings of modern culture. In order to do so, we will explore key contributions in psychoanalysis, semiotics, structuralism and post-structuralism, Marxism and ideology critique, feminist and queer theory, critical race theory and postcolonial studies. As we explore this wide range of approaches, we will interrogate how thinkers have imagined and reimagined terms like "art," "reading," "subjectivity," "modern," "discipline," "culture," "power," "technology," "sovereignty" and "nature," among others. And as we build this critical lexicon, we will examine the social institutions and intellectual formations that shape each debate. What kinds of knowledge does critical theory produce, and what are their blindspots? What forms of personhood and community do these theories outline, and in whose interests? What kinds of insights become visible when we examine conflicting theories together? Thinkers include Adorno, Agamben, Althusser, Barthes, Benjamin, Benveniste, Bhabha, Butler, Chow, Derrida, Fanon, Foucault, Freud, Gramsci, Hall, Haraway, Irigaray, Jameson, Lacan, Latour, Levi-Strauss, Lukacs, Marx, Ranciere, Said, Saussure, Spivak, Terranova, Willliams, and others. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

And why do queer theorists return so often to scenes of instruction and influence? In this course, we'll seek to answer these questions by working through two related sets of texts: we'll read fictions of discipleship alongside the work of queer theorists who reflect on both the possibilities and the dangers of being taught. Students will gain familiarity with queer theory's history and methods, from foundational to recent texts and from close reading to queer of color critique. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LAS OPEN SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The LAS Open Seminar is devoted to the development of undergraduate and graduate degree projects that engage the discipline of literary arts and studies, and involves the writing of a longer, research-based project (thesis, artist's statement, creative work, etc).   This engagement may take a variety of different forms, including a direct referencing or interaction with literary texts or issues; a focus on textuality and/or narrativity; a concern with research and the mechanics of writing a longer project.   Therefore, as the course title indicates, the seminar has an open structure to accommodate our ability to address and foster each student's interests and concerns.  As the semester progresses, we will move from a discussion of texts that introduce key concepts in the framing of interdisciplinary projects to group analyses and the workshopping of each student's project.  In the first part of the semester, we will discuss a number of conceptual tenets that will ground our theorization of the artistic process, including issues of intentionality and audience; issues of translation and interdisciplinarity; and the relation of form to content.  The second part of the semester will be organized and driven by group analyses of the degree and related written project of each class member. &lt;BR&gt;  (Note that the course is only open to Juniors, Seniors, 5th Years and Graduate Students.) &lt;I&gt;For permission to enroll in this course, please contact the instructor, Dr. Patricia Barbeito pbarbeit@risd.edu &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course will examine how female painters, photographers, performance artists and film directors use their bodies and elements of their biographies to build their art upon. We will read interviews with them and analyses of their work, watch documentary films, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role autobiographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Cindy Sherman, Ana Mendieta, Faith Ringgold, Marina Abramovic, Shirin Neshat, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Maya Deren, Frida Kahlo, Leonora Carrington, Agnes Varda, and Francesca Woodman. Students will do weekly readings; write weekly papers, as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a stimulus to the imagination, method of investigation, or as a basic means of communication, drawing is a fundamental process of human thought.  This class will examine various kinds of drawings from the history of art and visual culture moving chronologically from the medieval to the post-modern. Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  (This seminar is recommended for concentrators in History of Art and Visual Culture and for students especially interested in drawing.) &lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOGRAPHY AND MILITARISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography became especially popular as a vernacular and political medium around the time of the Crimean War in the nineteenth century. Since then, photography has been a critical medium that represents, commemorates, propagates, opposes, and complicates war and militarism across the globe. Histories of photography in the twentieth and twenty-first century have also unfolded through colonization, genocide, war, liberation, globalization, and war on terror. Militarism has thus been crucial to the medium's history: photography does not merely re-present the militarized life-in-the-making; it is an integral part of it. This course examines the ways in which the subject of photography has emerged through not only war but also what we will call "everyday militarism." Organized thematically according to photographic subjects, this course will closely investigate selected bodies of photographic work with readings on war, atrocities, subjectivity, ethics, and iconicity. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The rise of modern cultures of media, shopping, and entertainment since the middle of the nineteenth century has transformed how we encounter and perceive objects of design. The seminar investigates a range of venues in which design goods, from chairs to cars to computers, have been displayed, discussed, and consumed. Case studies may include museums and world's fairs, lifestyle magazines, big box stores, and social media. Emphasis falls on the question of how techniques of display shape the reception of meanings. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Organized thematically, with examples drawn from painting, sculpture, photography, film, popular culture and mixed media installations, we examine how the deployment, manipulations and construction of the signification of the asexualized mammy complex is juxtaposed against the jezebel vixen in a shifting terrain from the antebellum era through the ?post-racial? decade of the 21st century. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST AND THE GRAND TOUR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course investigates the role of the artist on The Grand Tour, a cultural pilgrimage through France and Italy made by British aristocrats during the 18th century. Improved infrastructure for tourism and the excavation of antiquities in Rome, Pompeii and Herculaneum opened up new markets for artists and offered unique opportunities for them to capitalize on their study and training in Italy. Artists set up studios and workshops in Rome where tourists commissioned portraits, prints, sculpture and decorative objects. Eventually, study on the Grand Tour became an essential component of an artist's education and practice.  Students will examine a variety of artworks produced during this pivotal era (and into the 19th and 20th centuries), both in Italy and at the RISD Museum, that represent the dynamic cross-cultural relationships between tourists and artists.  The goal of this course is to connect students with a transitional period that solidified links between critical making and art-historical scholarship.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;  There is a &lt;B&gt;REQUIRED&lt;/B&gt; trip to Rome over Spring Break. Permission of instructor required. Estimated travel cost: $3,000.&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for junior BFA.GLASS students&lt;br&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From Coptic fragments to 15th-century Italian trade silks, early 20th-century apparel fabrics to mid-century modern casement cloths, this course will utilize the extensive textile and apparel collections of the RISD Museum of Art as points of departure for the study of Western textile design. By way of illustrated lecture (both in the classroom and at the Museum), discussions and readings, students will come to understand the stylistic and cultural significance textiles have played in the history of Western art and culture from antiquity to the modern era. The manner in which social, economic, technological, and political changes have impacted advancements in textile fibers, fabric structures, color, and design will be explored. Research projects utilizing the textile and apparel collections will afford students the opportunity to partake in hands-on objects based study.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be preregistered by the department&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course is an introduction to studies of the plant kingdom: its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips and outdoor class assignments, will focus on observation of plant morphology,  adaptations to environmental conditions, as well as observation of plants as they transition out of dormancy. Students will learn to identify plants through recognition of morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Documentation of observations, through the use of field journals, will reinforce the importance of scientific record-keeping.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221.

   <COURSETITLE>NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores both the conflicted subject position of American Indians in popular culture as well as the manner in which American Indians inscribe their own subjectivity in films and literature. America Indians have been portrayed in a variety of different and often contradictory ways in American popular culture: from primtive savages to symbols of intuitive wisdom, from tragic figures that embody the loss of a culture and land, to hardy survivors. American Indian writers and filmmakers address these images in their current works.  This class will begin with a study of visual representations of Indians in paintings, photographs, popular cultural images, ethnographic films.  We will then focus on the novels and films made by prominent American Indians. Our inquiry will address Indian subjectivity and the manner in which American Indian writers inscribe the postmodern condition How do the experiences of this varied group of authors and filmmakers - all of whom are mixed-blood and vary in the degree of familiarity with their native culture-- interrogate existing stereotypes and beliefs about native peoples?  Further topics of discussion will include: the inclusion of trickster strategies and Indian humor;the relationship of narrative strategies  to oral traditions; the different community experiences of American Indians; and the construction and deconstruction of the self in novels/films. Finally, we will also attempt to formulate our own definition of what encompasses American Indian literature as well as its placement within the American literary canon.</COURSEDESC>

We will start out with some classic texts from Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, Raymond Chandler, and Georges Simenon, then move to contemporary texts, paying particular attention to the way the genre adapts culturally as it moves from Europe and North America into Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The final project will be a collaborative writing project that will result in the class creating its own detective novel. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LITERARY VISIONARIES: D.H. LAWRENCE AND FLANNERY O'CONNOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will explore two controversial and influential writers who struggled to illuminate possibilities for reformation and redemption in the rapidly changing world of the early to mid twentieth century. The British D. H. Lawrence and the American Flannery O'Connor both held religious and philosophical views that informed their writing. Lawrence's lamentation for the separation of people from the earth and the decline of powerful patriarchal spiritual leaders in a corrupt materialistic culture underlies his investigation into human relationships in the Modernist era. O'Connor's Roman Catholicism-with its emphasis on the concept of redemptive grace-provides the backdrop for her exploration into the problematic civilization of the post-World War II era. Lawrence often focuses on the British working class while O'Connor centers on the idiosyncratic population of the American south. Studying these two writers side by side should reveal the fascinating ways in which seemingly diverse writers converge to enlighten readers. We will read texts such as Lawrence's &lt;i&gt;Sons and Lovers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Complete Collected Short Stories&lt;/i&gt; and O'Connor's &lt;i&gt;Wise Blood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Other Stories&lt;/i&gt;. Students will keep journals, write two papers, and take mid-term and final exams.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IRISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Ireland has a long history of literature, stretching from pre-Christian epics through monastic manuscripts right up to the thriving contemporary scene. While there are many important Irish writers before the beginning of the twentieth century, clearly the birth of the Abbey theatre and the poetry of W. B. Yeats and the prose of James Joyce created reverberations still felt in Ireland today. Using Joyce, Synge, and Yeats as a beginning point, in this seminar we will look at a series of contemporary Irish writers whose work builds upon the foundation established in the early years of the twentieth century. One of the themes we will return to again and again in this course is the theme of loss - loss of language, loss of sovereignty, loss of loved ones.  What does Stephen mean when he says, "History is a Nightmare from which I am trying to awake"?  Why is Yeats left in "the foul rag and bone shop of the heart"?</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIVING WASTE LANDS: TRASH, ENERGY, AND SUSTAINABILITY IN FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In 1858, Edmund Dixon noted that even if you could "annihilate" all of Earth's garbage, sending it "off to the moon," the results would be disastrous, eventually leading to "utter sterility, famine, and the death of the human race."  For Dixon, trash was inescapable but necessary, simultaneously contaminating and valuable.  Waste underscores the limits of urban sustainability, and utopian visions of cities often depict an (almost) closed system, with a purpose for everything discarded and unused.  In this course, we will ask: How have writers and artists imagined the function of trash in society?  What can garbage tell us about a place?  How do the principles of thermodynamics shape the way that we think about waste?  In considering such questions, we will look at historical and contemporary works, including Dickens's Our Mutual Friend, Henry Mayhew's London Labour and the London Poor, Vivan Sundaram's Trash, and Lucy Walker's documentary Waste Land. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Focusing on literary texts from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Uruguay, we will investigate how writers assimilated and modified the European literary tradition, creating works that, notwithstanding some of their "universal" themes, incorporate questions particular to South America. These questions include: can we speak of unity in the context of South America's various literary productions? How has European literature influenced South American writers, and how have they incorporated and challenged it? How do they address politics, questions of gender, race, and class? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

For this reason, our inquiry will pay particular attention to topics such as tradition, colonialism, and gender politics in Algeria, Egypt, Palestine, and Lebanon.

We will investigate ways that 20th century artists including Salman Rushdie, Marc Chagall, A.S. Byatt, and Walt Disney have made use of this story in their own ways for their own persuasive ends. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will offer an introduction to both the theories and major works of Brecht and Fo.  Works by Brecht will include the theoretical treatise A Little Organum for the Theater, and plays such as Mother Courage and Her Children, The Life of Galileo, The Three-Penny Opera, St. Joan of the Stockyards, and The Good Woman of Sezuan.  From Fo's work we will read Tricks of the Trade, which relates his theories of theatrical performance, and the plays Mistero Buffo, Accidental Death of an Anarchist, Can't Pay?

The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: ENGL E412 Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience.&lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite or class level does not apply when course is offered during wintersession.&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a writer of historical fiction, I am drawn to set stories in the past for many reasons: fascination with another world or way of life, a desire to understand today's world through a study of the past, the desire to time-travel and experience another world through fiction. Students are invited to bring their passions and interests to the table in this course that will combine two disciplines, the study of history and the literary arts. Short works of historical fiction and discussions of craft specific to historical fiction will be read and discussed. Research techniques and resources will be examined. Students will produce one work of historical analysis that relies on the use of primary and secondary sources. The latter half of the semester will be focused on producing and workshopping fiction set in the past. The course assumes a familiarity with the writing of short fiction and the basic elements of craft. Previous courses in creative writing are preferred but not required; registration is by permission of the instructor and based on the submission of a creative writing sample.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above.

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of Anna Karenina reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Broadly defined, a green cultural studies approach asks questions about how the more-than-human other is produced and represented in texts. Furthermore, a green cultural studies approach seeks to explore the stakes and consequences of these productions and representations. In this seminar we will concentrate on discerning and analyzing discourses of nature present in films produced in North America in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Possible topics for consideration include: nature documentaries and other representations of the animal, the aesthetics of landscape cinematography, the symbolic role(s) of wilderness, the presence and consequences of environmental rhetoric, gendered encounters with the natural world, narratives of environmental apocalypse and/or toxicity, environmental justice, and cyborgs and other modified or transgenic organisms. To contextualize our primary texts in the films we will read articles on ecocritical theory and methodology, on film theory and philosophy, and on relevant environmental issues. Throughout the semester each student will do independent research. This research, shared with the class on a regular basis, will serve as the foundation for a final essay of at least twenty-five pages.  Open to sophomore and above</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Noir crime fiction and film have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity around the world: from Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling Millennium trilogy to the rise of Havana Noir.   Why this fascination with all things noir?  Like classic noir, these new crime fictions from around the world serve to "unleash demons..bottled up in the national psyche,"  but, more particularly, they do so at a time when the very notion of a national psyche is being redefined under the pressures of globalization.  Combining gritty realism, moral complexity and striking visual and literary styles, these texts adopt and parody some of the main conventions of classic noir crime traditions in order to comment on the effects of globalization and its neoliberal corporate underpinnings.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

What can we learn about Cuba's culture and history that allowed it's Printmaking and Art to thrive. A culture and history impacted by European colonialism, slavery and more recently isolation, from its powerful northern neighbor.  This travel course will explore Cuba; the studio component, will include printmaking and visits to Havana's print shops, the Liberal Arts portion of this course is designed to familiarize students with Cuban culture in general, and more particularly, to explore Cuban performative and visual arts. It will include lectures on both the African roots of Cuban culture and the contemporary arts scene in Havana and beyond.  The class will have the opportunity to explore the contemporary art scene in Havana and include travel to Santiago de Cuba, a beautiful colonial city rich in history and cultural treasures. Knowledge of Spanish not required, but helpful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course with PRINT-4412-01. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $3,590.00 - airfare not included.&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOTEXTUALITY: LITERATURES OF THE EMBEDDED IMAGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography and Literature are often seen as separate, yet kindred, disciplines, each working to depict, contest, alter, and reframe that which we think of as reality. This course will explore various ideas about the melding of photography and literature by looking at texts that work to create dialogue between the two mediums, as well as theoretical writings that offer ways of contemplating such fusions.  We will study texts by writers/photographers such as: Walker Evans, James Agee, W.G. Sebald, Sigmund Freud, Roland Barthes, Teju Cole, John Berger, Sophie Calle, Paul Auster, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Lance Olsen.  Students will write several short essays about the readings, as well as a longer project, which will combine photography and writing.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>METHODOLOGY/HISTORIOGRAPHY: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassa's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Trojan War is one of the most influential stories in the history of Western culture.  After a brief examination of the archaeological evidence for such an event, this course will focus on the art and literature inspired by the Trojan War from Ancient Greece through modern times.  Readings will include selections from Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and take into account return stories such as the Odyssey.  Art with Trojan iconography will be explored from ancient vase-paintings and sculptures through Renaissance and Baroque depictions, up to a contemporary graphic novelization and a brief discussion of films on the subject.  Major themes include the interaction of art and literature, and the mutability of an established narrative at the hands of subsequent creators.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCOCO ROCKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A key moment and place in the history of design, eighteenth-century art was innovative and rich in criticism, especially in France. Favored themes in the graphic arts and sculpture include gallantry (fetes galantes), eroticism, and domesticity. French art dealers were responsible for new designs for furniture and decorative arts; architects developed utopian projects; and seamstresses launched extravagant fashion trends. We will examine how rococo came to be the dominant artistic trend in all Europe and the kinds of controversy that it generated from the mid-century on. Rococo Rocks will provide analytical tools for understanding the visual arts within their social and critical contexts including the Enlightenment. We will navigate between genres and media, assess how works of art were then perceived, and discuss the position of women (whether mothers, wives, or artists). We will also study the ramifications of rococo?s continuing curve into twentieth-century art from Art Nouveau to Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons.&lt;BR&gt;   Visits to several departments of the RISD Museum are planned as well as to the Hay Library where we will study original eighteenth-century illustrations. Students? final projects consist in designing a rococo-inspired object in any medium (painting, sculpture, textile, print, or drawing) accompanied by an artist?s statement.</COURSEDESC>

We will look closely at self-portraits by artists ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn to Cindy Sherman, and from Albrecht Durer to David Wojnarowicz. Students will be asked to write about artists' self-portraits and also construct their own written and visual autobiographies. We will read memoirs by artists, as well as essays by Barthes, Foucault, and Krauss.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RITUAL PERFORMANCE IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores how art articulated the many rituals that permeated the Italian society from ca. 1350 to 1550. Ephemeral art and fragile objects that were only sporadically displayed (processional ones, for example) are rarely discussed in art history. Well-orchestrated events for birth, marriage and death were held in domestic or outdoor settings; citywide processions meant to ward off the plague or to honor a local saint, and political events such as princely entries or funerals flaunted colorful paraphernalia such as precious textiles, costumes, flags, statues, and decorated tapers. These gatherings often staged the performance of music, chanting and prayers, or religious drama. The art of public ritual not only created authority and expressed devotion but it also asserted one's rank in society, and maintained social order. To understand these phenomena, we will examine inter-disciplinary methodologies in art history from material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. One field trip to Boston is planned.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>To fulfill evolving forms of worship a new architecture evolved between 400 and 800 AD in South Asia. The early wooden buildings are represented in relief and paintings, as well as elaborately replicated within the ancient cave monasteries across India. This course traces the Indian architectural tradition, its transformation into a symbolic vocabulary for a new structure, the Hindu temple, and the development of the temple in India from ca. 500-1500 A.D. Students will be encouraged to explore the social, historical, and symbolic frames for this architecture. While introducing students to the remarkable variety of India's temple architecture, its multiple forms and uses, class discussions will also address broader issues of how architecture can be designed to compress meaning while accommodating multiple agendas of use.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

We will also examine theoretical pursuits in the liberal and technical arts by Leonardo and his contemporaries, and their assessments of visual art as a science, and studies of natural science as a systematic art. Particularly informative will be Leonardo's responses to contemporary trends, to artisanal traditions, to the antique, to members of princely courts and republics, and more generally to investigative and inventive strategies.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This non-mathematical presentation of optics leads us to an appreciation of the logic and beauty behind the behavior of light. Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will address questions of how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. The field of cognitive neuroscience aims to link the mind, the brain and behavior by trying to understand the biological nature of human thought and behavior.  In this introductory course we will discuss several topics including: How is the brain built and how well can it rewire itself? How can we measure the living brain? What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*GUYANA: ART &amp; SCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation, located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. More specifically, this course offers RISD students the opportunity to visit a biological hotspot and consider its role in society; participate in conservation science field research; interact cross-culturally; and develop their communication skills. Taught collaboratively, this course emphasizes the importance of connecting ideas, information, and methodologies across the arts, humanities, and sciences, with an emphasis on biology.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Students will spend the first week of the course at RISD, the next 3.5 weeks in Guyana and the last half week at RISD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take both LAEL-LE97 and LAS-E717. Students will receive 6 liberal arts credits as identified by each subject. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies. &lt;br&gt; Wintersession 2017 Travel Cost: $3,750.00 - airfare included&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FILM INVESTIGATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We explore both narrative and nonfiction films and videotapes.  We write essays to establish critical standards.  We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTOTEXTUALITY: LITERATURES OF THE EMBEDDED IMAGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Photography and Literature are often seen as separate, yet kindred, disciplines, each working to depict, contest, alter, and reframe that which we think of as reality. This course will explore various ideas about the melding of photography and literature by looking at texts that work to create dialogue between the two mediums, as well as theoretical writings that offer ways of contemplating such fusions.  We will study texts by writers/photographers such as: Walker Evans, James Agee, W.G. Sebald, Sigmund Freud, Roland Barthes, Teju Cole, John Berger, Sophie Calle, Paul Auster, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Lance Olsen.  Students will write several short essays about the readings, as well as a longer project, which will combine photography and writing.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMERICAN LITERARY MASTERPIECES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on four masterworks of fiction from the periods of American realism and modernism: Huckleberry Finn, My Antonia,  The Grapes of Wrath and  Native Son.  Imaginatively centered on sociological issues such as racism, child abuse, the marginalizing of immigrants in American society, and the exploitation of migrant workers, these works have contributed significantly to our understanding both of American history and culture and of tragic human experience.  We will discuss reasons why these works have a distinguished place in the American literary canon and consider whether or not they will be perceived as literary masterpieces in the new millennium.  If time permits, the class will meet the standards of literary excellence we develop during the course. Students will keep journals and write two papers, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WENDELL BERRY AND THE ETHICS OF LAND USE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Kentucky writer Wendell Berry has created a body of work that examines the interface of the human and the ecological in poetry, fiction, and essays. Berry has developed what William Least Heat Moon calls a "deep map" in a very specific region of Kentucky, moving through time to reveal changing land use and loss of (agri)culture. We will be reading Berry's work and posing questions about human responsibility and our own relationships to land and home. &lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FILM ASIAN AMERICAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN QUEER FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since the early Hollywood years, films have played a major role in the way American mainstream culture inscribes queerness: the many and diverse queer communities, identities, and experiences. This course begins with an examination of earlier representations of queerness in Hollywood films, tracing queer cinematic images throughout the early 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  We will screen queer films such as Nazimova's &lt;i&gt; Salome (1922) &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; The Killing of Sister George (1968) &lt;/i&gt; to analyze their representations of queer identity and examine what they signify to us today.  Our examination of queer film will address the following questions: What is gay or lesbian film?  What is a queer film? What are the ways in which the discourses of race, gender, and sexuality are interrelated and deployed?  The latter half of the course also will examine selected films and documentaries from the new emerging queer cinema and a selection of film shorts that are currently running in queer film festivals.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLORIZING FILM: THE HISTORY OF BLACK FILM IN THE USA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will be an intense and focused examination of Black filmmaking in the USA.  The critical journey will start with early 20th-century films, including those of Oscar Micheaux.  We will then continue on to so-called Race films, marching through the L.A. Rebellion/Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers and Blaxploitation films.  We will end with current independents, exclusive of Spike Lee and Lee Daniels.  We will analyze form, content and theoretical interventions in order to sketch, if not fill in, an artistic, cultural, and political practice that remains in the literal shadows of Hollywood and White film hegemony. You MUST be prepared to screen many films, read critical and theoretical essays, and write thoughtful, cogent papers that will help us center filmmaking practices that are too often decentered.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCKUMENTARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Visions of youthful utopia in Monterey Pop (1968) give way to violence and mayhem in Gimmie Shelter (Rolling Stones, 1970). Martin Scorsese offers an epilogue to an era in The Last Waltz (The Band, 1978). Madonna sells herself in Truth or Dare (1991) and Metallica undergoes group therapy in Some Kind of Monster (2004). Rock documentaries are as much about the social and political state of America as they are about music and musicians. In this course, we will explore the visual language and cultural history of the rockumentary film genre. Topics for discussion will include: documentary and cinema Veriti narrative forms; the troubled notion of documentary "truth"; music as commercial product; fandom and the cult of celebrity; and the rise of MTV. Students should be prepared to participate in class discussion, attend film screenings, complete critical readings, and hone their analytical writing skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Magical realism brings together the real and the fantastical.  When the bizarre and impossible intrudes on our ordinary world, the result can be shocking, moving, funny, powerful.  This course will focus on writing magical realist stories.  We will read and discuss stories by established writers as well as work by members of the class.  Students will write three stories and submit one to a literary journal to be considered for publication.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*ITALY:(IN)VISIBLE VENICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course presents the opportunity for a cultural and literary interrogation of Venice, in situ in combination with an immersive studio course. This 3-credit  Non-Major Studio (NMSE) is integrated with a mandatory/concurrent 3-credit Liberal Arts (LAS) component.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A city of paradoxes or merely contradictions? American historian Thomas F. Madden describes Venice as "a city without land, an empire without borders."  French philosopher Rgis Debray, on the other hand, calls it "a kind of Euro-Disney for snobs," whereas Italian novelist Italo Calvino treats it as a paradigmatic point of intersection between death and desire, and so the quintessence of every city on earth.  Venice's status as off-shore metropolis at the top of the Adriatic - a marshy haven from invading "barbarians" that has conquered, traded with and been dominated by its antagonists, including the sea over more than a millennium - makes it one of the most intriguing and atypical cities in Europe, if not the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;This is a co-requisite course. Students must also take NMSE-0723-01. Students will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course.
