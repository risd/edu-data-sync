   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: ART &amp; RITUAL IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C503.

   <COURSETITLE>ARTS OF THE AMERICAS AND THE PACIFIC</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to acquaint students with a variety of non-Western aesthetic expressions in the Americas and the Pacific. The course will explore the indigenous contexts, both contemporary and historical, in which these art forms are or were created and function. We will look at the art and its context in selected communities of the American northwest coast such as the Inuit, Kwakiutl and Haida, the Southwest of the US, such as the Hopi and Navajo, and parts of Australia, Papua-New Guinea and some of the Pacific islands.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C726.

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JERUSALEM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Jerusalem has earned a special eminence among the famed ancient cities of the world.  Its sanctity to Jews, Christians, and Moslems has made the city a focus of discussions and controversies regarding the evolving and changing identifies throughout its long urban history. Early and recent studies and discoveries, as well as old and new theories with a special emphasis on the Roman, Byzantine, and Early Islamic periods (ca. 63 BCE - 1099 CE) will be examined in the seminar.  A particular focus will be placed on how to identify ethnicity, religious identity, and gender in the archaeological record.  Though politics and religion have often biased related scholarship and the way excavations and their interpretations have been presented to the public, the goal of the seminar is to understand and examine various opinions and viewpoints.  This seminar will consist of regular meetings, with illustrated lectures, student presentations, and discussions. In addition to the presentations, weekly reading assignments, a mid-term exam, and a final term paper will be required.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C729.

   <COURSEDESC>The art and architecture of ancient Mexico as well as that of selected neighboring areas, will be examined against the background of the growth of complex cultural systems.  The course will consist of readings and lectures including the presentation of visual materials dealing with ancient Mesoamerica (a culture area), and the archaeological and historical research which sheds light on its development.  Museum visits to RISD and Brown will allow us to become familiar with real pre-Columbian art and artifacts for a closer association to ancient cultures that produced them.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as HPSS C735.

We will consider a variety of texts including Christian manuscripts, classical western literature, Qur'ans, histories and romances that were illuminated during this period.  By looking at a series of individual manuscripts as case studies, we will consider a variety of issues including the relationship of word and image, artistic techniques, the role of the script and the creation of visual narrative. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is globalism, and should we be celebrating it? Can we disentangle globalism from capitalism, and what is at stake in this effort? And what happens to the specificity of the local - the base of the political - in the internationalist flows of contemporary art? Examining notions of canon, legacy, influence, discourse, history, tradition, place and displacement, this seminar maps the current state of international contemporary art. It focuses on the recent artistic, scholarly, critical and curatorial attempts to rerout the linear trajectories of late modernism. Such initiatives all aim at conceiving an expanded - or even exploded - cartography of contemporary art. What might such a map look like? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL ARTS IN CHINESE HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides an introduction to the study of visual arts in Chinese history. It will introduce the major developments and themes of Chinese visual culture, interpreted broadly to include bronzes, jades, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, textiles, printing, ceramics, and architecture. The lectures will follow a chronological and thematic course through the development of visual culture in China. We will consider how to position these objects within a historical and cultural context, with particular attention to the interactions between visual arts and gender, religion, politics, and ethnic identity. Using formal analysis, and reconstructing production processes and consumption contexts, we will learn how to describe, research, and discuss objects of Chinese visual arts. We will also explore the recirculation of these objects, both in China and abroad, and how far theories and methodologies of Western art history can be productively applied to Chinese visual culture. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How does a museum preserve its art collection? How do art and science reinforce each other in this field?  Does the approach to the conservation of ancient art differ from that of the conservation of contemporary art?  How and why do materials composing visual art deteriorate?  Which environmental factors adversely affect organic and inorganic materials first or fastest?  In this course, the student will gain an understanding for the five agents of deterioration, for issues of physical and chemical stability regarding organic and inorganic materials chosen by artists over the millennia, as well as how the care and handling of art differs in some respects for a museum than for a working artist.   Frequent visits through the museum exhibits, storage, and the conservation lab will demonstrate key concepts covered in the class.  Ethical issues regarding the determination of the original intent of any given artist as well as ethical issues regarding forgeries and looted art will be discussed.  Assignments will focus on the RISD Art Museum's collection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Restricted to HAVC concentrators or MA candidates in Museum Education&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

   <COURSEDESC>This survey course focuses on the history of landscapes in the pre-industrialized world. Landscapes will be considered as an evolving condition, even when their defining characteristics were conceived and built at a specific point in time.  Critical to this course will be the establishment of frameworks for historical inquiry, the refinement of research methodologies, in the development of multiple perspectives through which to question and understand the design environment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Art History credit for Landscape Architecture majors required; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed as an introduction to the 113-year history of the projected moving image (film, animation, and video). Artistic expression in these forms will be emphasized. Students discover new areas of interest while watching carefully selected examples of films and videos. During all classes, students will view films representing different styles and periods of filmmaking. About half of the classes are devoted to contemporary films. Critical thinking will be encouraged and fostered during classroom discussions. Clear expression of these thoughts will be developed through assigned readings and weekly writing assignments. During the semester, students learn about specific artists, schools of filmmaking, genres, and fields within the history of the film, animation, and video. Students also develop a common language by learning the meaning and proper usage of a glossary of common film terms. At select classes, film artists are present to introduce and discuss their work. Other guests include improvisational musicians who accompany silent films.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Registration priority to FAV majors&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO INSECT MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 Canterbury Tales), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and The Tempest), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter, and Melancholia illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of No Country for Old Men in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's Shalimar the Clown or Bahman Ghobadi's Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's The Submission, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior, Krakauer and Penn's Into the Wild, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary Gasland, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in Moonrise Kingdom, and imaginary places in films like After Life (Kore-eda Hirokazu), Micmacs (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and Marwencol (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSTCOLONIAL LITERATURE I: Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Postcolonial literature is the writing produced by people in or from regions that have escaped the yoke of colonialism.  Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our reading will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America.  The spectre of slavery and its repercussions will reverberate in many of the readings.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or a book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them. Writers may include Chinua Achebe, Isabel Allende, Michelle Cliff, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, George Lamming, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Derek Walcott.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHAKESPEARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The name Shakespeare often conveys a set of commonly held assumptions about style and eloquence in the English language, British history, the power of dramatic literature, the protocols of theatrical performance, and Renaissance/Early Modern Culture in general --not to mention the "human condition."  In this seminar, we will work at "unpacking" some of these assumptions by undertaking a critical examination of the plays and poetry in the context of 16th- and 17th-century economics, political struggles, ideological shifts, literary history, thresholds of poetry and history, and the cultural place of the theatre as a new and controversial space of representation, performing specific scenes if necessary in order to show what this space looks like. Requirements for the course include regular short writing assignments, a modest research paper and a final examination.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students who register for this course must register for both LAS E416 and ILLUS 3612 for a total of 6 credits.

We will begin from both Marxist and psychoanalytic engagements with semiotics, visuality, mass media, sexuality, and representation. Proceeding through structuralism and post structuralism, we will examine the important contemporary debates about the individual's relationship to identity, aesthetics, power, history, technology, and the lived environment taking place in recent feminism, queer and postcolonial theory, and eroticism.  No previous familiarity with critical theory is required. Critics will include Marx, Freud, Lacan, Foucault, Benjamin, Lukacs, Adorno, Barthes, Derrida, Althusser, Crary, Baudrillard, Butler, Harraway, Said, Chow, and Zizeck.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIZING THE ANTHROPOCENE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In an article published in 2000, ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer and atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen presented data on human population growth, urbanization, industrial agriculture, fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, rates of extinction, and changes in land use to argue that we are living in a new geological epoch, one marked by the "central role of mankind in ecology and geology."  To demarcate this epoch from the Holocene, they coined the term Anthropocene, the "age of man."  Although scientists continue to debate whether to officially designate the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch, scholars in the environmental humanities have begun exploring what it means to re-conceptualize humans as a biosphere-altering geological agent.  In this class we will examine literature, theory, non-fiction, science, films, maps, and visual art texts that help us chart the effects of anthropogenic activity on the planet and theorize the Anthropocene.  Some questions this class will consider include: How do geologists define the Anthropocene?  What tools are necessary for reading and recording the Anthropocene?  How do cultural texts conceptualize the Anthropocene?  What role can the concept of the Anthropocene play in how we understand "natural" and "human" systems?  How does the concept of the Anthropocene pressure our understanding of temporal and spatial scales?  This is a discussion-based class with occasional in-class writing, two 2-page single-spaced papers, and a final paper or project.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The majority of course work will be specifically designed for each course member. &lt;i&gt; Registration is by instructor permission only.  Please email to the instructor a description of your degree project, and why it would benefit from an intensified study in textuality.  Include your name, major, and rank.  (Note that the course is only open to Juniors, Seniors, 5th Years and Graduate Students.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to explore the relationship between sacred "texts" (including those that have been transmitted verbally for generations) and the images that are associated with them and/or inspired artists in their traditional contexts. We will look at the cultural context of sacred narratives in such communities as the Kwakwaka, the Hopi, the Maya and other Mexican communities, the Dogon, Australian traditional aboriginal groups, and other Pacific communities, time permitting. Topics will include sacred texts and landscape, sacred narratives and the notion of a person, sacred texts and contemporary arts, and other related topics. The course will require a final research project.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C504. Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM IN ART AND GLOBAL POLITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will survey the emergence of an avant-garde in the United States during and after World War II.  The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTIST'S TALK: KENTRIDGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course analyzes the most commanding artists' lecture-performances of our time, focusing on the rhetorical strategies and performative gambits that contemporary artists muster in service of their public image.  It is also a practical course in rhetoric, or how to give an artist's talk. In the first few classes we analyze some of the classic modernist debates around self-representation- the quandaries of talking a little or talking a lot, for example - and explore high modernist texts as Matisse's Notes of A Painter and Picasso's 1933 self-curated retrospective. The class considers a range of landmark lectures, from those of Ben Shahn to John Cage, Robert Morris and Frank Stella. The last section of the course addresses William Kentridge's lecture-performances in tandem with developing individual student's rhetorical skills, both through presentations of other artist's work and their own. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will watch feature and documentary films, read literary texts, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role biographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Meret Oppenheim, Leonora Carrington, Frida Kahlo, Cindy Sherman, Marina Abramovic, Laurie Anderson, Agnes Varda, Chantal Akerman, Francesca Woodman, and others. Students will do weekly readings; will write weekly reviews of films as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS ON SCREEN; HOW MOVIES REPRESENT THEIR LIFE, WORK, AND ADVENTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When in the 16th century Giorgio Vasari described the life and adventures of Renaissance geniuses, together with their works, styles and ideas, art history as biography was born. Centuries after, in the 19th and 20th centuries,  psychoanalysis renewed myths, enigmas and aura of the artist as a complex psychological  subject. In the same decades cinema too renewed the genre of the artist biography and the documentary about his/her life and work.  Until now movies always update the artist's aura,  exhibit his/her 'body at work', narrate love stories, adventures and the  path to celebrity.&lt;BR&gt; This course considers films about artists of different times and countries. We'll see how directors stage artists or use actors to interpret them, their aesthetics ideas and political intentions. We will explore the artists' studios, working methods,  exhibit places, and listen to their  interviews.We will see how the film language reframes and interprets the life and work of  Caravaggio, Artemisia, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock, Basquiat, Warhol, Frieda Khalo, Richter, Kentridge and others, and how directors interact  with artists and their media, and with us the viewers. Course works: screenings, readings, group discussions, and two papers.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through close study of houses, interiors, furnishings, and a range of texts, this seminar will explore multiple concepts of domesticity and ways these have informed design practice. Classes will be conducted as collaborative workshops focusing on discussion of assigned texts and analysis of images. Student research projects will investigate a contemporary work of design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL VOCABULARY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class provides an introduction to contemporary art theory and its philosophical underpinnings.  Through critical readings in philosophy, literary theory, psychoanalysis, and art history, this course aims to familiarize students with the occasionally obscure, and sometimes blustery language of contemporary art.  Each class we approach a single term: such as "fetish," "neo-avant-garde" or "relational aesthetics;" or analyze dialogic pairings like "author/authority" or "origin/originality."  We examine the historical trajectories and philosophical underpinnings of these terms, charting their shifting and at times contradictory meanings. We also discuss some of the key texts of contemporary art in which these critical terms appear, and finally we consider what is at stake in the use of this critical vocabulary.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the ?mayline,? the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already ?epistemic? things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS MOVEMENT IN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Beginning in the 1870s, an international movement to reform the design of architecture and interior furnishings took hold in America.  Its proponents were on a mission to improve the aesthetics of daily life, and they waged a moral crusade that advocated the pride and honesty of hand craftsmanship and embraced the ideal of unity of design. This course addresses reform ideals in the architecture, graphics, furniture, silver, ceramics, and related interior furnishings of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in America from 1875 -1920. The importance of experiencing and interpreting objects in context is emphasized through artifact study in the collections of the John Hay Library, the RISD Museum, and the Providence Art Club.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERFORMANCE ART: BETWEEN MEDIA AND MASS MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The main feature of Performance Art is its immediacy. As other forms of time-based art, Performance depends upon its documentation. The course explores the history of Performance Art through the media used to document it: photography, cinema, radio, books, journals, posters, objects, video, digital technologies and the Internet. The goal of the course is to show how the history of Performance Art is deeply connected with the development of mass media and technology in our society. Performance artists have been exploring mass media both as an instrument and as the content of their practice since the beginning of the Modern era. The course has an historical and theoretical approach, considering Performance Art from a wide perspective including social and cultural events at large and crossing the boundaries between visual art, design, theatre and subcultures. We will start with historical avant-gardes like Futurism and Dada up to contemporary art and activist practices like parades, flash mobs and re-enactments, passing through Action Painting, Situationism, Body Art and Relational Aesthetics.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar considers how the legacies of colonialism, and the processes of decolonization in Africa, Asia and Latin America have shaped contemporary art. We address the rhetoric of globalism through the lens of colonialism and its aftermaths, and examine the proposed relationships among various kinds of "posts" - postmodernism, postcolonialism, poststructuralism, post-history. A wide range of contemporary art, much of it from the southern hemisphere will be addressed. Readings include Said, Appiah, Bhabha, Spivak, Coetzee, Mbembe, Hardt and Negri, Bourriaud, Mirzoeff and Demos. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE VISUAL CULTURE OF ROMANTICISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Romantic concepts about the omnipotence of nature encouraged the ideals of human equality and democracy.  The Romantic search for truth, authenticity, and identity permeated empirical experience, feelings, and emotion. In this course we examine the visual expressions of Romantic ideals with particular focus on art of the 19th century.  We explore how images conceptualized morality, religious thought, nationalism, and human rights, as well as the new role of the artist as public intellectual, prophet and seer.  Readings from Romantic literature and a variety of contemporary texts will provide the social, intellectual and political context.  The enduring influence of Romantic thought on American art and life will provide our subtext.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From political protests of the Arab Spring, Occupy Wall Street, and Ferguson, Missouri, to recent demonstrations concerning climate change, representations of public dissent and social upheaval remain a stronghold in photography. This seminar investigates the relationship between contemporary photographic practices and social chance. By analyzing multidisciplinary texts as well as key case studies, we will explore a range of contexts including 1960s Civil Rights and women's movements, postcolonial struggles, body politics and queer liberation, war and mass migration, individual and collectivist practices, citizen photojournalism, the global justice movement, representations of violence, and shifting systems of circulation from print to social media. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for beginners in Italian and provides an introduction to the basic structures of the language and to Italian culture. Throughout the course, situations that often represent obstacles to newcomers to Italy are presented to assist students in learning how to immerse themselves into a new country and a new culture. Vocabulary and grammar are presented through teaching materials-including listening comprehensions, and the reading of Italian texts-which refer to situations relevant to the students' experience in Italy.  The study of the Italian language is integrated with an overview of contemporary Italian culture through films, music and lectures that deal with cultural topics. Students will be asked to perform role-plays, street assignments and discussions in order to enable them to speak and interact in Italian. Students are expected to participate actively in the class discussions and activities, and to contribute with suggestions, ideas and presentations &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From Egyptian vessels to skyscrapers, glass has been central to every aspect of life. In a chronological sequence, this course explores the progress and purpose of glass making and its artistic, practical, or psychological effects. Several sessions will be devoted to conceptual themes such as glass as a thinking tool (glass and science), as a technology for sight and introspection (windows and mirrors), and as a path to divinity (medieval stained glass; Islamic glass). Powerpoint-based lectures will foster interaction among the participants with weekly readings as a basis for discussion. A website (an e-portfolio on digication) will enhance the communication between students, the instructor, and the teaching assistant while allowing everyone to post ideas, comments, and visuals. Several visits to the RISD Museum are planned to view both the permanent collections and pieces from storage. Students are expected to give an oral presentation on a theme or an object of their choice.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for junior BFA.GLASS students&lt;br&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that Earth is a place of constant environmental change. Much less obvious is what the changes we see around us mean in terms of human impacts and future conditions. This is partly because Earth's changes are viewed through the varying lenses of biology, ecology, evolution, oceanography, climatology, and geology. This course surveys the scientific methods and knowledge that underlie and unify these disciplinary perspectives on environmental change. Emphasis is on changes in Earth's climate and oceans, with ecology providing the primary point of reference. Course time is divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

By way of illustrated lecture (both in the classroom and at the Museum), discussions and readings, students will come to understand the stylistic and cultural significance textiles have played in the history of Western art and culture from antiquity to the modern era. The manner in which social, economic, technological, and political changes have impacted advancements in textile fibers, fabric structures, color, and design will be explored. Research projects utilizing the textile and apparel collections will afford students the opportunity to partake in hands-on objects based study.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIOLOGY OF ANIMAL-HUMAN INTERACTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines how human activity impacts the animal world, how animals impact us, and how both are affected by the health of the environment.  We may find it convenient to think of humans as living in one sphere while plants and animals occupy another, but it's not that simple. All creatures share the same basic needs for air, water, shelter, food, space, and companionship - and we compete for these resources.  In order to maintain the balance necessary for healthy ecosystems, it's essential that we understand how one species impacts another.  Using a series of examples, we'll explore these connections, beginning with simpler animals and ecosystems, and moving up to more complex ones.  Topics covered include coral bleaching, the extinction of frogs, the use of DDT to control malaria, why dolphins strand, the future of polar bears - and more. We'll also study the potential solutions to these problems.</COURSEDESC>

This course will be an introduction to the vascular plant kingdom; its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips will facilitate the observation of plants in natural community assemblages, and will aid in students? understanding of similarities among plant families, as well as their adaptations to environmental conditions. Students will learn the Latin and English names of common species and learn to identify these plants through recognition of their unique morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Students will learn the importance of documentation for study and scientific record keeping and will create mounted specimens of plant species for the use of all students at the RISD Nature Lab. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN ECOLOGY: HOW WILDLIFE INTERACTS WITH URBANIZING LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221. Register into the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>"THIS IS THE WOONASQUATUCKET": STORIES OF A LIVING RIVER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course invites students to engage as researchers and creative artists with the Woonasquatucket River, and with the people in its watershed.  At RISD we see the Woonasquatucket just before it reaches the sea.  But if we turn and follow the river upstream, under the Providence Place Mall, through Valley and Olneyville, to its source in North Smithfield, we begin to recognize the impact the river has had on the state, through massive industrialization in the 19th century to current efforts at environmental and social reclamation.  In this course we will study the river through story.  First, we will research the Woonasquatucket and its watershed, investigating the history, economy, politics, culture, and ecology of the region. Second, we will focus on Oral History, and learn the basics of interviewing and audio recording.  We will gather stories from people whose lives have been entwined with the river, paying particular attention to the expressivity of the human voice, and environmental sounds.  Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary work on sound and voice in poetry.  Finally, students will organize and present their work, and collaborate on a collective project of public interest.  How to collect and represent will remain ethical and aesthetic questions throughout.  Teaching and learning methods will include assigned readings and discussion; print, web and field research; field recording, audio recording and editing; guest speakers; and production/publication.  We will meet once a week for 3 hours, mostly on campus but several times in the field.  When we meet off-campus, travel may take up to an hour each way, in addition to class, and students should plan accordingly.  The course will be taught jointly by an anthropologist and a poet.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This course may be taken for either HPSS or LAS credit. Specify your preference when obtaining permission to register. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley (Transformation), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Conrad (Secret Sharer) and Lawrence. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS: GENDER AND MEDICINE IN VICTORIAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses upon two interconnected threads in the literature of nineteenth-century Britain-issues of gender and the development of the medical profession. During the Victorian age, the medical field sought to establish itself as a respectable and organized profession, and this effort led to widespread discussions and developments amongst practitioners who attempted to discover the causes and cures of various ailments and perfect their understanding of the human body. As male doctors attempted to establish their position as the sole authority on the human body, women's bodies became a primary focus in medical circles. Victorian medicine portrayed women's bodies as potentially dangerous; they could infect others through disease, go mad, make themselves ill through overwork, die as a result of menstruation, pregnancy, or childbirth, pass on problematic traits to their children, and even become murderous as a result of biological drives. Interestingly, the medical profession also offered an idealized portrait of female health, sometimes believing women to be "born good," describing ill women as beautiful or saintly, and championing the idea that women made the best caregivers for other sick people. In this class, we will read a variety of literature which focuses upon gender and medicine in the Victorian age, drawing upon actual medical articles, newspaper stories, fiction, poetry, memoirs, and even examining pieces of art. We will discuss topics which include (but are not limited to) revivification, invalidism, mesmerism, feminism, the doctor-patient relationship, nursing, reproduction and childbirth, insanity, disability, pseudo-science, masculinity, sexually transmitted diseases, contagion, and psychiatry. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRAVEL WRITING: THE AMERICAN ROAD TRIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The open road is often conceived in American literature as a mainstay of democracy; freedom to travel is integral to the American dream.  The courage to travel, to explore, is a true marker of that most lauded national ideal: self-reliance.  Americans frequently take to the roads to find themselves, but how does the journey help shape our identities? &lt;BR&gt;  This course will examine a variety of twentieth century road trip narratives (books and films) to understand how the road teaches us what it means to be American.  We will give particular consideration to how gender, age, class, race, and ethnic identity might influence one's experience of the road, and, conversely, we will look at how the mythology of the road has affected our collective understanding of those categories.  Other topics to be addressed include, American regionalism, the "outsider's" view of America and, of course, America's love for the automobile.  Our travel guides: Walt Whitman, Jack Kerouac, Eddy Harris, Henry Miller, John Steinbeck, William Least Heat-Moon, Diana Hume, and John Krakauer.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomores and above.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LIVES OF OBJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A dancing table, a blind glass, a tender button. This course examines how modern representations of the inanimate world speak to questions concerning human life, human rights, and the shape of desire, by tracing industrialization?s effects through the horrifying recognition that we, too, have become thing-like. While the human/inhuman distinction has remained a perennial interest to artists, writers, political economists, anthropologists, and philosophers, such an obsession intensified with the rise of industrial capitalism in the early 19th century. Using things as a lens, we will cover such topics as fetishism, reification, the uncanny, and the art-object in order to pursue the strange lives that objects assume in the modern imaginary. At the same time, we will consider how discussions of thingness reflect on systems of exploitation, including slavery, colonialism, and human trafficking. We will explore the processes of producing, collecting, consuming, exchanging as they are described in 19th and 20th century literature, film, and political discourse in order to ask the following: What is the difference between a thing, an object, and a commodity? How have human subjects come to be constituted by the inanimate world around them? How do these narratives of possession-of being possessed by possessions-approach something stranger than the history of a culture of consumption? As a way of answering some of these questions, we will turn to important thinkers and artists on these topics, which will likely include: Karl Marx, Georg Lukacs, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Gertrude Stein, Joseph Cornell, Nathaniel West, Charlie Chaplin, Georges Perec, Ralph Ellison, Muriel Spark, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnes Varda, Donna Harraway, Susan Stewart, and A.M.

   <COURSEDESC>The course examines the ways in which literature responds to the utopian dreams and dystopian nightmares engendered in the current moment of globalization. Are we still living in the ruins of Babel -- defined by conflict, fragmentation, and mutual incomprehension? Or is this a time of harmony and translucent immediacy when neither linguistic nor cultural translation is necessary? What happens to notions of language and humanity as literature and life both become disposable; as origins become untraceable; and as forms of violence -- whether terrorist, revolutionary, or poetic -- are seen to infect the everyday? Readings include late-20th century and contemporary novels and poetry from post-totalitarian Chile, post-unification Europe, de-secularizing Turkey, post-colonial South Asia and Nigeria, post-socialist Poland, and post-revolutionary Algeria (Roberto Bolao, Juan Goytisolo, Orhan Pamuk, Amitav Ghosh, Chris Abani, Michal Witkowski, Assia Djebar). These texts will be supplemented by films and theoretical essays.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LITERATURES OF AFRICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will begin to explore the literature emerging out of postcolonial Africa, looking at novels, short stories, poetry, and drama.  With over 40 independent countries and a multiplicity of cultures, any course of this nature can only be an overview.  However, we will read a number of important writers of the last fifty years, including Chinua Achebe, Nadine Gordimer, Christopher Okigbo, Wole Soyinka, and Ngugi wa Thiong'o, as well as lesser known writers including Tayeb Salih and M.G. Vassanji, and explore some of the problems facing independent African countries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have not only shaped contemporary culture; they have also shaped how we talk about culture, as well as how we talk about bodies and communities. Is there progressive potential in the trend toward computerization? Or contrarily, in what ways might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

How much of such categorization is about a pure assessment of the artistic end product, and how much more is about the social-cultural baggage (gender, race, socio-economic class) that underwrites the process of performance-making?  This course will probe the dys/functional marriage between "performance" and "art" through the conceptual tool of "craft." While we will of course consider the history of performance art, this is not a survey course. Rather, using speech-act theory of performativity as groundwork, we will theorize and finesse the creative process by which the human body becomes a compelling medium of object-making.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Taking its cue from Clint Eastwood who proclaimed, "As far as I'm concerned, Americans don't have any original art except Western movies and jazz," this course will analyze the Western film as an art form in and of itself. We will discuss Westerns in terms of their specific aesthetic and technological influence on the medium, their cultural expression of a national political unconscious, and their global function as the meta-narrative of space. This course will tackle these discussions through a chronological unfolding of the genre starting with the Edison Company's 1898 Westerns and Edwin S. Porter's &lt;i&gt;The Great Train Robbery (1903)&lt;/i&gt; through the Golden Age of John Ford and Howard Hawks' films and the reciprocal translation of Akira Kurosawa's epics, and finally, to the variants of the Spaghetti, Revisionist, and genre-bending contemporary and postmodern Westerns of Dennis Hopper, Sam Peckinpah, John Sayles, Jim Jarmusch, Ang Lee, and Wim Wenders. There will be required readings in critical film theory, weekly screenings, analytical essays, and oral presentations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The word "liary" references the seven volumes of Anais Nin's diaries, which, upon their publication, were denounced by Nin's friends as utter fiction, as the "liary."  This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a writer of historical fiction, I am drawn to set stories in the past for many reasons: fascination with another world or way of life, a desire to understand today's world through a study of the past, the desire to time-travel and experience another world through fiction. Students are invited to bring their passions and interests to the table in this course that will combine two disciplines, the study of history and the literary arts. Short works of historical fiction and discussions of craft specific to historical fiction will be read and discussed. Research techniques and resources will be examined. Students will produce one work of historical analysis that relies on the use of primary and secondary sources. The latter half of the semester will be focused on producing and workshopping fiction set in the past. The course assumes a familiarity with the writing of short fiction and the basic elements of craft. Previous courses in creative writing are preferred but not required; registration is by permission of the instructor and based on the submission of a creative writing sample.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above.

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FICTION AND THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the 1990s Queer Theory emerged as a critique of the ways in which power institutionalizes and thereby legitimates certain forms of sexuality while marginalizing others.  Sue-Ellen Case, a performance theorist, claims that "queer theory works not at the site of gender, but at the site of ontology, to shift the ground of being itself. Queer revels constitute a kind of activism that attacks the dominate notion of the natural. The queer is the taboo-breaker, the monstrous, the uncanny" (quoted from Queer Theories). Through our readings of seminal queer theorists such Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gayle Rubin, we will explore important questions about the politics of queerness. Our investigation will focus on sexuality and gender, closeting, homophobia and drag, the aesthetics of queer literature, and the ways queer writers such as Leslie Feinberg, Kate Bornstein, and Randall Kenan interrogate and inscribe such subjects in their work.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of Anna Karenina reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: NOIR GOES GLOBAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Noir crime fiction and film have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity around the world: from Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling Millennium trilogy to the rise of Havana Noir.   Why this fascination with all things noir?  Like classic noir, these new crime fictions from around the world serve to "unleash demons..bottled up in the national psyche,"  but, more particularly, they do so at a time when the very notion of a national psyche is being redefined under the pressures of globalization.  Combining gritty realism, moral complexity and striking visual and literary styles, these texts adopt and parody some of the main conventions of classic noir crime traditions in order to comment on the effects of globalization and its neoliberal corporate underpinnings.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHANTOMS OF BEAUTY: ART AND POLITICS IN MODERN ITALIAN FILM MASTERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course studies Italian visual culture and politics - issues of landscape, architecture, painting, history, and fashion - in some major Italian filmmakers who have been labeled with art historical and aesthetic terms:'ealist' Rossellini, 'baroque' Fellini, 'modernist' Antonioni, 'mannerist' or 'avant-garde' Pasolini, 'theatrical' Visconti, 'spectacular' Bertolucci, and 'essayist' Moretti.  Like 'phantoms of beauty' (a term used by the Italian film critic Guido Fink), images, aesthetic issues and styles from art history, politics and media have consciously inspired or deeply haunted the works of these authors. Film critics have analyzed their idiosyncratic and avant-garde fusion of aesthetics and politics in debates which have established their ongoing international status of 'masters of the art film' from the 1940's to the 1990's and beyond. We will study some of these films as constructions of the modern Italian identity and visual culture for a national and international audience.  Requirements: Weekly group discussions on readings, one final paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassa's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE GRAND TOUR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class will survey The Grand Tour - a cultural pilgrimage through France and Italy made by young British men and women during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The Grand Tour was designed to provide a liberal education to budding aristocrats by introducing them to continental language, music, art and architecture (ancient, Renaissance and Baroque), and to the sophisticated mores of fashionable society.   The Grand Tour also opened up new markets and opportunities for artists in their native cities and abroad. Grand Tourists returned home with crates of pictures, books, sculpture and decorative objects which would be exhibited in libraries, cabinets, gardens and drawing rooms, as well as in galleries built for their display. In this course, we will begin our journey in London and follow Grand Tourists on their travels through Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii, and examine the work of artists such as Canaletto, Batoni, Piranesi, Canova, Mengs, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Adam, and Hubert Robert. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will look closely at self-portraits by artists ranging from Rembrandt van Rijn to Cindy Sherman, and from Albrecht Durer to David Wojnarowicz. Students will be asked to write about artists' self-portraits and also construct their own written and visual autobiographies.

General themes will be perspective, form, color, and mechanical devices, and will include discussions on intellectual training, notebooks, treatises, and collecting. The course will examine artists such as Masaccio, Leonardo, Piero della Francesca, D|rer, Serlio, Carlo Urbino, Cigoli, Rubens, Vel`zquez, Saenredam, Vermeer, Poussin, Andrea Pozzo, Canaletto, Phillip Otto Runge,Turner, Delacroix, Monet, and Seurat. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: PAPERMAKING, TEMPLES AND PRINTS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTS OF JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material: its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Register for PRINT-4525 and you will be added to this Art History class by the Registrar &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required &lt;br&gt; Registration begins on October 10 and ends on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.&lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Alexander the Great is one of the most significant figures in ancient history, and the culturally diverse empire he created gave birth to new trends in art characterized by hybrid styles and innovative new kinds of artistic propaganda.  The study of the place of art in such a multicultural society has implications for the interpretation of art's role in the modern world.  This course will discuss the way Alexander and his successors controlled their image in art and the styles of sculpture, painting, architecture, and urban planning that were precipitated by the socio-political changes brought about by his conquests.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OPTICS &amp; MAKING HOLOGRAMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Wintersession seminar has a focus on making holograms with lasers and on understanding the physics that makes holograms and lasers work. Ideas from familiar phenomena help us see the connections between everyday life and the abstract ideas of physics. This non-mathematical presentation of optics leads us to an appreciation of the logic and beauty behind the behavior of light. Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Professional actor/director Fred Sullivan (Trinity Repertory Company resident artist and RISD Acting Workshop instructor)  will guide a company of student actors, designers, stage managers, and construction crew through a workshop process of producing a live play for the stage, culminating in a weekend of public performances of the production. Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

Some can be predicted, some can be avoided, and some can be mitigated.  But how?  In this course, we will explore how the natural world works, and how this working is evident in some of the most pressing environmental issues of today.  Learn why you might not want to invest in that beachfront property, how the Burma cyclone was like hurricane Katrina, and whether it's wise to place a swimming pool on that scenic overlook.

   <COURSEDESC>This course will address questions of how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. The field of cognitive neuroscience aims to link the mind, the brain and behavior by trying to understand the biological nature of human thought and behavior.  In this introductory course we will discuss several topics including: How is the brain built and how well can it rewire itself? How can we measure the living brain? What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives, including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. Students will spend the first two weeks of Wintersession at RISD, learning about the social history of Guyana; studying its geological, ecological, and biological history; exploring literature and art produced by Guyanese authors and artists; and examining the challenges and opportunities of both conservation and ecotourism in a developing country. Students will then spend two weeks in Guyana where they will explore the bustling capitol city of Georgetown and do fieldwork at the Karanambu Trust House, a biodiversity research and training station located in the sparsely-populated North Rupununi region of the country. The course finishes with a wrap-up session at RISD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students must also register for co-requisite LAS-E717. &lt;br&gt; Open to Sophomores and Above.&lt;BR&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $3,900.00&lt;BR&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RISD/LEGO/DIGITAL/ANALOG PHASE 1: RESEARCH SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>During 2014-2015 RISD is engaged in an exciting, LEGO-sponsored research project: an investigation of the ways digital and analog modalities productively inform each other.  Cas Holman (ID) and Nicole Merola (LAS), the co-leads of the project, have broken the coursework components of the research into two phases, a Wintersession 2015 3-credit LAEL/NMSE Research Seminar (Phase 1) and a Spring 2015 6-credit out-of-major Studio elective (Phase 2).  While some students may register for both the research seminar and the studio, registration in both courses is not required.  Registration is by permission of the Instructor; students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. &lt;BR&gt;  In this Phase 1 interdisciplinary research seminar, students will use humanities and studio methodologies to investigate, map, and analyze cultural practices and objects in which the digital and the analog comingle.  The overarching goal of the course is to constellate and assess a set of digital + analog objects and practices in order to draw conclusions about what makes these objects and practices compelling.  That is, we will be interested in examining the ways particular digital + analog objects and practices position their users-in relation to the object/practice, in relation to other users and/or objects/practices, and, more generally, in relation to the material world.  While making is an important component of this seminar, its focus is the theoretical/conceptual.  Through mapping and analyzing the specific ways digital and analog modes relate to, enhance, and inform each other, students will work individually and in groups to produce a set of research findings and exploratory inspiration sketches that will inform Phase 2, the Spring studio.  &lt;BR&gt; Coursework will include reading and viewing humanities, design, and fine arts texts/objects/practices that engage the intersection of digital and analog; using writing and making as tools for exploring the intersection of digital and analog; developing a coherent set of research findings that can be presented to and interrogated by peers and guest critics; producing exploratory inspiration sketches and a set of research findings to hand off to the Phase 2 Spring studio.  &lt;BR&gt; Representatives from LEGO Education will attend final critiques for this Wintersession course.  &lt;BR&gt; This course is limited to 15 students.  &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We explore both narrative and nonfiction films and videotapes.  We write essays to establish critical standards.  We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEXUALITY &amp; SUBVERSION: FICTION &amp; FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Rope to Fried Green Tomatoes to Fight Club and beyond, 20th century mainstream American writers and filmmakers toyed with and hinted at-or even overtly confronted-the concept of homosexuality, often with mixed results. Critics, reviewers, and even scholars have generally labeled these popular texts "subversive," but were they? If so, to what extent and why? In order to explore these and other questions, we will initially investigate the term subversion (as opposed to transgression or "ludic play"), through theoretical texts and class discussions. We will then move on, to see how subversion might (or might not) work within and among the competing, complementary, and conflicting discourses in various texts. In addition to those listed above, the literary texts and films will likely include: Boys on the Side, The Women of Brewster Place, Single White Female, M. Butterfly, Truth or Dare, Madonna's Sex, The Object of My Affection, The Next Best Thing, and others.  At the semester's end, we will examine Brokeback Mountain as the 21st century's "answer" to the texts of the preceding century. Students will write several brief responses, give a class presentation, and take a midterm and final exam. In addition, students will need to acquire online or other access to the films.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXTREME FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most mainstream fiction is realist in form and narrative in style. These stories generally have a beginning, middle and end, and adhere to a formula that includes rising action, climax, and denouement. The fictions we will examine in this course, however, may have few or none of those qualities:  they may be nonrealist, nonnarrative, postmodern, or fall somewhere between and among these categories, but they provide a counterpoint and challenge to preconceived notions of what a story ought to look like, how it should unfold, and even what relationship the readers should have to the text. We will begin the course with some more traditional stories and then move directly into examining alternative fictions. The readings will likely be selected from texts written by the following authors: Donald Barthelme, Kathy Acker, Italo Calvino, Ishmael Reed, Pamela Zoline, Angela Carter, Ursula LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Dixon, Michael Wilkerson, Karen Brennan, and others. In addition to the readings, students will be required to give a presentation (with at least one other member of the class), write several responses, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

The meaning of the dramatic texts studied will be linked to their significance and potential social effects. Written largely during periods of turbulent social change, the texts chosen provide an opportunity to reflect on the transformative power of theater. Beginning with a broad overview of the issues and performance traditions impacting African American drama, we will proceed to the major highlights in the evolution of the latter. Notions of race, gender, class, and how these impact the retrieval of black people as speaking subjects will also be examined.</COURSEDESC>

We will examine this territorialization of magical realism by comparing the ways in which novels from the "South" -- South America, the Caribbean, Southern U.S. -- formulate the relation of land to individual, familial, and cultural identity.  We will also examine how these "counterrealist" regions reflect on the supposed "rationalism" of the North.  Works to be considered include novels and essays by: Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Octavio Paz, Flannery O'Connor, Toni Morrison, Ana Castillo, William Goyen. &lt;i&gt; Space may be available during Add/Drop for upperclassmen &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FILM ASIAN AMERICAN AND AFRICAN AMERICAN QUEER FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since the early Hollywood years, films have played a major role in the way American mainstream culture inscribes Queerness: the many and diverse queer communities, identities, and experiences. This course begins with an examination of earlier representations of Queerness in Hollywood films, tracing Queer cinematic images throughout the early 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  We will screen Queer films such as Nazimova's &lt;i&gt; Salome (1922) &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; The Killing of Sister George (1968) &lt;/i&gt; to analyze their representations of queer identity and examine what they signify to us today.  Our examination of queer film will address the following questions: What is gay or lesbian film?  What is a queer film? What are the ways in which the discourses of race, gender, and sexuality are interrelated and deployed?  The latter half of the course also will examine selected films and documentaries from the new emerging Queer Cinema and a selection of film shorts that are currently running in queer film festivals.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EKPHRASIS AND ITS REVERSE: WRITING FROM ART, ART FROM WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Here's Marcel Proust on his love of art: "Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves, to know what another person sees of a universe which is not the same as our own." Instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists. I want to do something similar in this course: to encourage students to see visual art in terms of writing and writing in terms of visual art, and thus to inspire them in their own studio practice and writing. Students will write creative texts related to their artistic interests or the work of the artists who inspire them and will create art in response to literary texts. We will read various writers (Rilke, Proust, WH Auden, Frank O'Hara - many others) who have been influenced by visual artists, and vice-versa. We will explore questions of narrative, framing, place, autobiography, appropriation, metaphor and symbol, truth and realism, irony, and so on. How can a poem or piece of fiction 'tell the story' of a sculpture or painting? How can a painting 'translate' a passage from Proust, a short story by Kafka or a poem by Elizabeth Bishop? How can it fail, and how are these failures interesting? What is lost in translation between art and literature, and what does this say about the singularity of each medium?  Our overarching aim will be to inspire students through a series of juxtapositions (looking at the similarities between negative space in painting and 'silences' in literature, for example), and to encourage them to engage with and find inspiration in ideas and methods from fields beyond their major.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED FICTION WRITING WKSHP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The advanced workshop assumes that students have some experience with writing fiction and are ready for an environment that will challenge them to hone, revise, and distill their craft. A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: ENGL E412 Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience.&lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite or class level does not apply when course is offered during wintersession.&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FREAKS, QUEENS, MINSTRELS, AND SPECTACLES OF THE HUMAN BODY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will be looking at various displays of the human body, focusing on four main arenas: the freak show, the minstrel show, the drag show, and the human zoo. We will focus extensively on the 19th and early 20th centuries, the heyday of human exhibitions, and move forward to current modes of display, which both contest and refigure earlier spectacles. Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*GUYANA: ART &amp; SCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives, including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. Students will spend the first two weeks of Wintersession at RISD, learning about the social history of Guyana; studying its geological, ecological, and biological history; exploring literature and art produced by Guyanese authors and artists; and examining the challenges and opportunities of both conservation and ecotourism in a developing country. Students will then spend two weeks in Guyana where they will explore the bustling capitol city of Georgetown and do fieldwork at the Karanambu Trust House, a biodiversity research and training station located in the sparsely-populated North Rupununi region of the country. The course finishes with a wrap-up session at RISD.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students must also register for co-requisite LAEL-LE97. &lt;br&gt; Open to Sophomores and Above.&lt;BR&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $3,900.00&lt;BR&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
