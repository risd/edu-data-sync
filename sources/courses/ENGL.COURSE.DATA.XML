   <COURSETITLE>SYMBOLISM IN ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A symbol has its own story to tell and how it finds its way into man-made objects. The beauty of nature becomes a living poem that is inserted into a piece of art; weaved into a textile, or carved into a building. This course focuses on the meaning of symbols through different religions and cultures as well as in geographical locations. Through readings and lectures, students will learn how different types of symbols (geometric, vegetal and figural) can be used in their art &amp; designs. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam. No previous experience in symbolism in art and design are necessary or expected.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is globalism, and should we be celebrating it? Can we disentangle globalism from capitalism, and what is at stake in this effort? And what happens to the specificity of the local - the base of the political - in the internationalist flows of contemporary art? Examining notions of canon, legacy, influence, discourse, history, tradition, place and displacement, this seminar maps the current state of international contemporary art. It focuses on the recent artistic, scholarly, critical and curatorial attempts to reroute the linear trajectories of late modernism. Such initiatives all aim at conceiving an expanded - or even exploded - cartography of contemporary art. What might such a map look like? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

We shall look at the modernist art of Austrian painters such as Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, as well as the "minor" arts of illustration, photography, scientific imaging, and film in light of Freud's psychoanalytic ideas. Classes will be devoted to topics such as avant-garde postcard design, ethnographic photography, and scientific images including x-rays and surgical films.  The silent erotic "Saturn" films that were screened in Vienna from 1904-1910 will also be considered. Requirements include mid-term and final exams, two essays, and interest in the subject (no past experience needed).</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE "MASTERPIECES" RETURN: A CRITICAL ART HISTORY OF CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our visual culture has become unthinkable without screened moving images. Writers have imitated film; leaders have used cinema as propaganda; artists have mediated film language; and artists have made avant-garde films. Critics establish rules for film evaluation, even as artists challenge traditional notions of masterpiece. Contemporary film-makers continue to offer visual spectacles, political debates, and intriguing psychological plots. How can we define modern, post-modern, and contemporary masterpieces of cinema as industrial production and capitalist bio-politics? How do we make aesthetic judgments after a century of cinema?  Students will study film interpretation and realize how cinema can shape our technological, aesthetic and political environment. Course requirements: two papers, short reports, and weekly class discussions of films and readings.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Bronze Age saw the development of several advanced civilizations in the Mediterranean basin. Perhaps the best-known among these is the civilization of Pharaonic Egypt. This course will focus on the art and architecture of Egypt and their neighbors to the north: the Aegean civilizations known as Cycladic, Minoan, and Mycenaean. While art historical study of these cultures will be emphasized, evidence for trade and other cultural interchange between them will also be discussed. The course will cover such topics as the Pyramids of Giza, the Tomb of Tutankhamun, and the Palace of Knossos.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD TEXTILES: TRADE, TRADITIONS, TECHNIQUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology across Asia, Africa and the Americas will be explored utilizing the RISD Museum of Art with frequent visits to the textile and costume collections. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Students will also have opportunity to examine various methods of textile display, analysis and storage appropriate to items of cultural heritage via case studies of specific objects in the RISD Museum.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IDENTITY IN FLUX: PHOTO PORTRAITURE FROM DAGUERROTYPE TO SELFIE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the history of photographic portraiture since the "invention" of the medium in the 1830s up to the present day. Particular attention is given to exploring the ways that identity is created, reinforced, or deconstructed through the limits and capacity of photography. How does photography transform the way identity is constructed through imagery in the early years of its history? How has photography shaped the formation of subjectivity in portraiture? In what ways does photography challenge or reinforce cultural and political hegemony by "representing" a person? How have digital photography and social media transformed the ways that an identity is constructed and shared by others? To answer these questions, examples of photo portraiture, from vernacular to artistic modes and spanning the globe, will be assessed. Each class will focus on theoretical debates on identity and subjectivity in relation to the given topic, with an interdisciplinary approach incorporating art history, cultural studies, critical theory, memory studies, postcolonial theory, and area studies. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed as an introduction to the 113-year history of the projected moving image (film, animation, and video). Artistic expression in these forms will be emphasized. Students discover new areas of interest while watching carefully selected examples of films and videos. During all classes, students will view films representing different styles and periods of filmmaking. About half of the classes are devoted to contemporary films. Critical thinking will be encouraged and fostered during classroom discussions. Clear expression of these thoughts will be developed through assigned readings and weekly writing assignments. During the semester, students learn about specific artists, schools of filmmaking, genres, and fields within the history of the film, animation, and video. Students also develop a common language by learning the meaning and proper usage of a glossary of common film terms. At select classes, film artists are present to introduce and discuss their work. Other guests include improvisational musicians who accompany silent films.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Registration priority to FAV majors&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do we know about the environment, and how do we know it? This course will combine field trips and ecology experiments with lectures and readings to explore the natural world and humanity's interaction with it. We will study the principles of ecology and how natural systems work, and look critically at pressing environmental problems such as climate change, global loss of biodiversity, and explosive human population growth.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over generations of time.  This course examines how evolution occurs through natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift, beginning with the search for the origin of species (speciation) by artist-naturalists Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates. Their observations of animal diversity (species variation, island geography, and mimicry) provided evidence for common descent within the animal kingdom, and led to the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection.  Studies of the fossil record paleontology yielded more evidence. Eventually, the genetic basis of evolution was explained by Gregor Mendel's discovery of heritable traits, later named genes.  Today, studies of evolution continue on a molecular scale with DNA and RNA (genomics) and proteins (protenomics).  Students will be graded based upon responses to study questions, participation during class discussion, performance on two written exams and a project on scientific visualization.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO INSECT MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 Canterbury Tales), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and The Tempest), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>I AM PROVIDENCE: THE WORDS AND WORLDS OF H.P. LOVECRAFT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>No writer is more closely associated with Providence than the sci-fi and "cosmic horror" genius Howard Phillips "H.P." Lovecraft. So, what better place to explore his work than a RISD classroom yards from where the author lived and worked? This course will provide students not just with a survey of Lovecraft's world-famous fiction, but an exploration of his nonfiction (letters, essays, etc.), his critical reception (from scholarly journals to the New Yorker and the New York Review of Books), his influences (Poe, Maupassant, and others), and his considerable imprint on contemporary culture (from comic books to films to video games to heavy metal lyrics). Writing assignments will range from analytical essays to creative experiments imitating the author's distinctive subjects and style. The class will have a strong multimedia component where students will examine films, plays, music, and visual art inspired by Lovecraft. We will also spend significant time outside the classroom, taking guided historical tours of Lovecraft's Providence and trips to his gravesite and beloved Ladd Observatory. Throughout the course, students will also take advantage of the Lovecraft Collection at Brown's John Hay Library - the world's preeminent Lovecraft archive.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AFRICAN AMERICAN REALISM: 1940-1960</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Richard Wright (an author whose influence loomed large throughout the Realist period) expressed his admiration for what he called "fighting with words: using words as weapons." Throughout this course we will examine the variety of ways in which writers of the Realist period used their writing as a "weapon" to protest against the racism they saw as endemic to white American society and as a means of linking the African-American struggle for equality with other forms of political struggle occurring worldwide. Marked by a focus on urban realism, the role of the environment in the shaping of the individual, and a close interrelation of literature and politics, the Realist novel revealed the ways in which African Americans were denied the "American Dream" and, in James Baldwin's words, provided a new language with which to express the African American experience. Authors include Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Anne Petry, Chester Himes, Ralph Ellison and Gwendolyn Brooks.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this course, we will undertake a creatively critical examination of several plays in the context of 16th- and 17th-century political struggles, major ideological shifts, colonial expansion, literary movements, and the cultural place of the commercial theatre as a new and controversial space of representation that vigorously appropriated traditional narratives.  Requirements for the course include regular short writing assignments, a modest research paper, a final examination, and attendance at a local theatrical production.  &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Is there progressive potential in the trend toward computerization? Or contrarily, in what ways might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>A BLOODY MESS: THE CRITICAL VALUE OF HORROR FILMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The horror genre has long been devalued as an art form, considered a source of cheap thrills and perverted voyeurism. In this class, however, we will take an in depth look at this film genre to understand its continuing appeal and critical value as a signifier of social anxieties and cultural critique. Studying a variety of films across the decades and several countries we will ask questions about cinematic development, viewer psychology, race, gender, sexuality, class, youth culture, and consumerism. By the end of the class, I hope we will decide that the "bloody mess" in horror films exposes society's deepest fears and anxieties about what really might be going bump in the night. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POLITICS AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the intersection of the questions "What is the political?" and "What is the political film?" Filmmakers and scholars have asked these questions in a variety of ways:  Can film form be fascist?  Or left-leaning radical? Can the form be radical if the content is not? And, vice versa, can content be radical in a traditional form?  Is film political only in terms of social issues?  Or can film be political also in terms of filmmaking?  The arrival of film theory's idea of the political unconscious made it possible to ask these questions even of the slightest Hollywood entertainment.  In order to make sense of this discussion we will consider the political use of the apparatus, the narrative, the genre--documentary, Hollywood blockbuster, independent--and the reception as well as the history of the political film.  Throughout the course our speculation will be aimed at answering the practical question "How does one make a political film?"  Students will be required to write analytical papers throughout the semester.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Such a project necessitates thinking about the book as flesh.  You will be asked to develop an intimacy with the book that will allow you to give it a different and differently true contours. &lt;br&lt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will begin from both Marxist and psychoanalytic engagements with semiotics, visuality, mass media, sexuality, and representation. Proceeding through structuralism and post structuralism, we will examine the important contemporary debates about the individual's relationship to identity, aesthetics, power, history, technology, and the lived environment taking place in recent feminism, queer and postcolonial theory, and eroticism.  No previous familiarity with critical theory is required. Critics will include Marx, Freud, Lacan, Foucault, Benjamin, Lukacs, Adorno, Barthes, Derrida, Althusser, Crary, Baudrillard, Butler, Harraway, Said, Chow, and Zizeck.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

   <COURSETITLE>THE GRAND TOUR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this seminar, students will investigate the role of the artist on The Grand Tour, a cultural pilgrimage through Europe made by budding aristocrats during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The Grand Tour came to represent a rite of passage for Tourists, and opened up new markets and opportunities for artists in their native cities and abroad. Though often of a different social class than 'tourists' proper, artists increasingly traveled with them and supplemented their earnings by serving as drawing masters and guides.  They set up workshops and studios in key cities where Grand Tourists purchased pictures, prints, sculpture and decorative objects that would be exhibited in libraries, gardens and galleries built for their display back home. In this course, we examine a variety of works and objects, both in class and at the RISD Museum, that represent the dynamic relationships between tourists and the artists whose works they commissioned and collected.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERWOVEN GLOBE: ASIAN TEXTILES IN EARLY MODERN GLOBAL TRADE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This lecture course uses the 2013-14 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition &lt;I&gt;Interwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800&lt;/I&gt; as a starting point to examine the role of Asian textiles and dress in the globalized markets of the early modern era. Using paradigms of global history and methodologies of material culture, we will explore how channels of trade, migration, and diplomacy enabled cottons and silks from India, China, and Japan to travel around the world and capture the imaginations of distant markets. What role did textiles like Indian chintzes or Chinese trade silks play in changing the consumption patterns and behaviors of Western European and North American society? How was the production and design of objects like the Kashmir shawl or the Manila shawl themselves transformed by transfer to new locales and societies through import and imitation? In order to understand the processes by which traditional designs and constructions were adapted for far-off markets and consumers, students will engage in close study of artifacts from the RISD museum collection of trade textiles. Assignments will allow students to develop skills in writing museum exhibition labels, longer catalogue entries, and also a research paper that more fully explores the design and development of these fascinating textiles.</COURSEDESC>

We will watch feature and documentary films, read essays, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role biographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Cindy Sherman, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Maya Deren, Frida Kahlo, Leonora Carrington, Ana Mendieta, Faith Ringgold, Marina Abramovic, Shirin Neshat, Agnes Varda, and Francesca Woodman. Students will do weekly readings; write weekly papers, as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Designers and theorists have defined the domestic environment in many ways: as individual refuge, symbol of collective identity, tool for social engineering, or fashion object, as masculine or feminine, aesthetic or functional, revolutionary or oppressive. Through close study of houses, interiors, furnishings, and a range of texts, this seminar will explore multiple concepts of domesticity and ways these have informed design practice. Classes will be conducted as collaborative workshops focusing on discussion of assigned texts and analysis of images. Student research projects will investigate a contemporary work of design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL VOCABULARY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class provides an introduction to contemporary art theory and its philosophical underpinnings.  Through critical readings in philosophy, literary theory, psychoanalysis, and art history, this course aims to familiarize students with the occasionally obscure, and sometimes blustery language of contemporary art.  Each class we approach a single term: such as "fetish," "neo-avant-garde" or "relational aesthetics;" or analyze dialogic pairings like "author/authority" or "origin/originality."  We examine the historical trajectories and philosophical underpinnings of these terms, charting their shifting and at times contradictory meanings. We also discuss some of the key texts of contemporary art in which these critical terms appear, and finally we consider what is at stake in the use of this critical vocabulary.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL ARTS IN CHINESE HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides an introduction to the study of visual arts in Chinese history. It will introduce the major developments and themes of Chinese visual culture, interpreted broadly to include bronzes, jades, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, textiles, printing, ceramics, and architecture. The lectures will follow a chronological and thematic course through the development of visual culture in China. We will consider how to position these objects within a historical and cultural context, with particular attention to the interactions between visual arts and gender, religion, politics, and ethnic identity. Using formal analysis, and reconstructing production processes and consumption contexts, we will learn how to describe, research, and discuss objects of Chinese visual arts. We will also explore the recirculation of these objects, both in China and abroad, and how far theories and methodologies of Western art history can be productively applied to Chinese visual culture. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART, CRAFTS &amp; POLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL ESSAY FILMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Literary and philosophical essays have each had an illustrious history. In the cinema, essay films constitute a controversial genre similar but different from documentary, experimental, avant-garde or political film.  Essay filmmakers create non-fictional works as aesthetic and political weapon "at the intersection of subjective rumination and social history." They exhibit the presence of an author and call for critical interpretations, even as they remix and explore archives of moving images.  Present in installations and on the web, these artists are globally popular as political and aesthetic provocateurs.  They offer intellectual pleasures other than those of conventional narratives by reinventing the "arts and crafts" of "screen culture." We will study essay films from diverse times and places, and review notions and theoretical categories: avant-garde, self-reflexivity, auteur. Requirements: two papers, short reports, and weekly class discussions of films and readings.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

It will also focus on the range of issues that museums in general are currently addressing such as ethics, provenance, audience, and architecture. There will be visits to storage areas with curators to understand the scope of the collection, as well as sessions on topics such as conservation, education, installation, and exhibition development. Written assignments will include preparing catalogue entries for recent acquisitions, developing gallery guides, analyzing current exhibitions and/or devising proposals for reinstallation of the permanent collection. The course is designed particularly for those students who have had little behind-the-scenes experience in museums.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as GRAD 500G 01 with limited seating for graduate students desiring graduate seminar credit.

The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the 238 years of the Shaker experience in America the artisans and designers of this utopian communal religious group created a world of artisanry and design distinguished by simple practicality and lasting aesthetic appeal. This course examines the visual culture -- the architecture, furniture, woodenware, textiles, drawings, metalwork, and other material evidence of the Shaker experience -- in the context of the Shaker belief that the work of Shaker hands is consecrated by spirituality. Requirements for this course include two Saturday field trips to Shaker villages in Massachusetts and Maine.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Romantic concepts about the omnipotence of nature encouraged the ideals of human equality and democracy.  The Romantic search for truth, authenticity, and identity permeated empirical experience, feelings, and emotion. In this course we examine the visual expressions of Romantic ideals with particular focus on art of the 19th century.  We explore how images conceptualized morality, religious thought, nationalism, and human rights, as well as the new role of the artist as public intellectual, prophet and seer.  Readings from Romantic literature and a variety of contemporary texts will provide the social, intellectual and political context.  The enduring influence of Romantic thought on American art and life will provide our subtext.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANCIENT ALIENS &amp; FANTASTIC FAKES: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF PSEUDOSCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Did aliens build the pyramids?  What happened to the lost city of Atlantis?  Does a Mayan carving depict a space shuttle?  Who were the real first settlers of the Americas?  Humans have always struggled to make sense of the remains left by past cultures.  Through careful, measured study by archaeologists and historians we have been able to create a scientific and historically informed understanding of the traits and accomplishments of ancient peoples.  At the same time, alternative, flashier, fantastic theories about the past  - even occasionally archaeological hoaxes  - are regularly presented in popular culture on television, in the movies and on the internet.  These theories, referred to as pseudoscience, are not based on the rigorous logic and evidence used by archaeologists, but rather represent a range of biases and flawed interpretations.  This course will critically examine popular and fantastic views of archaeological sites and discoveries.  We will begin by establishing how archaeologists conduct analyses and form their theories.  We will then explore a series of pseudoscientific case studies, in which we will critically evaluate the evidence and logic behind these theories, as well as their impact on our understanding of the past.   </COURSEDESC>

From the earliest classical period through to the twentieth century, we will explore how Chinese, Korean and Japanese images of women reveal women's changing positions and roles in family and society. Through themes that include gender, patriarchy, virtue, sexuality, beauty, life cycles, and body practices, we will consider how notions of femininity and womanhood were constructed, re-invented and re-interpreted in different socio-cultural contexts of nation-building, modernity, colonialism, consumerism, and globalization, and how visual culture allows us to question and expand established historical narratives. Class sessions will combine short lectures with in-depth reading discussions, close analysis of images, film viewings, and visits to the RISD museum.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

By way of illustrated lecture (both in the classroom and at the Museum), discussions and readings, students will come to understand the stylistic and cultural significance textiles have played in the history of Western art and culture from antiquity to the modern era. The manner in which social, economic, technological, and political changes have impacted advancements in textile fibers, fabric structures, color, and design will be explored. Research projects utilizing the textile and apparel collections will afford students the opportunity to partake in hands-on objects based study.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will be an introduction to the vascular plant kingdom; its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips will facilitate the observation of plants in natural community assemblages, and will aid in students? understanding of similarities among plant families, as well as their adaptations to environmental conditions. Students will learn the Latin and English names of common species and learn to identify these plants through recognition of their unique morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Students will learn the importance of documentation for study and scientific record keeping and will create mounted specimens of plant species for the use of all students at the RISD Nature Lab. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

For each area, we will first consider the anatomical structure, including the bones, muscles, nerves, arteries and veins. We will then study the function, including movement, systems and processes. Each area will be further explored through common injuries and syndromes with an anatomical basis, which are illustrative of function through dysfunction. We will discuss treatments with an anatomical basis, including typical surgical approaches and procedures, and the design of prosthetics. Through this course, we will demystify and develop an appreciation for the wondrous  complexity of the human body and its role in art and design. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221.

   <COURSETITLE>CANTERBURY TALES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>One night, late in the fourteenth century, in a tavern outside London, a quiet little fellow named Geoffrey, so the story goes, joined a lively crew about to ride sixty miles to Canterbury.  To entertain themselves on the way, they began a story-telling contest.  The premise is fiction; however, the resulting Canterbury Tales offers some of the most memorable poetic narratives ever written. Geoffrey Chaucer (1345-1400), called sometimes the "father" of English poetry, wrote tales of back-alley rendezvous, the lives of knights, saints, and independent women, the misadventures of talking chickens, and more than one scurrilous story about scheming students. Participants in the class will learn to read Middle English as we go (which is not as difficult as it might seem: think Shakespeare with funny spelling).  There will be regular quizzes, midterm and final exams, and a modestly researched critical paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROMANTIC TO EDWARDIAN BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley (Transformation), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Conrad (Secret Sharer) and Lawrence. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REBIRTH OF MODERNITY: NEW KNOWLEDGE, New Worlds, and Renaissance England</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The world was becoming a very different place in the 16th Century.  The Protestant Reformation, continental wars of religion, transatlantic colonial expansion, and the emergence of new scientific paradigms profoundly affected the complex of ideas that had presided in Europe since antiquity.  The scope of the transformation was broad, but in this course we will examine closely the influence of two Italian thinkers (Giordano Bruno and Niccol Machiavelli) on late Elizabethan poets Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare.  Bruno was busily rethinking the elemental order of the universe; Machiavelli had redefined the nature of the state and the operations of power.  Each was controversial in England for very different reasons, but also prompted a thorough reimagining of the order of things among young British writers of the day.  Among the texts we'll read are: Bruno's Italian dialogues (written and published in London); Machiavelli, selections from The Discourses on Livy and The Prince; Spenser, Shepheardes Calender and Faerie Queene; Marlowe, The Jew of Malta, Tamburlaine, Dr. Faustus; Shakespeare, Hamlet, The Tempest.  There will be regular short writing assignments in response to readings, an independently researched project and a final exam. Students will also be responsible for consistently informed engagement in class discussions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HAWTHORNE AND HIS FEMALE CONTEMPORARIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804 - 1864), famous (or infamous) for dismissing the American female novelists of his time as a "d---d mob of scribbling women" and as "ink-stained Amazons," had a more complicated connection with his female contemporaries than these labels insinuate.  By reading some of Hawthorne's texts side by side with writings by some women of the nineteenth century, we will study the texts' thematic and stylistic interconnectedness.  This study will help us develop a more informed assessment of the nature of Hawthorne's relationship with the "scribblers" of his time.  Of special importance will be a consideration of what being an artist in nineteenth-century America meant to both Hawthorne and his female contemporaries.  This topic will lead into the maze of psychological, philosophical, and sociological issues significant in Victorian American culture, remnants of which persist in our culture today.  We will read texts such as Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and The Blithedale Romance, Alice Cary's Clovernook Sketches and Other Stories, Margaret Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century, Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills and Other Stories, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson.  Students will write journal entries and two papers and take a final exam.  Those who have completed all assignments and have at least a B average will have the option of constructing a final project (written or written and visual) instead of taking the final exam.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course aims to introduce students to the theory and practice of 21st and 20th century Sound Poetry, primarily in the English language tradition.  Students will engage with canonical and contemporary examples, write a conference paper on a practitioner / area of practice / problem of choice and compose and perform new work, individually and/or collaboratively. Concepts considered may include line, silence, noise, meter, rhyme, repetition, assonance, rhythm, tone, volume, authority, articulation, audience, listening, harmony, dissonance.  We may also consider  relationships and tensions between the aural and visual in poetry; between poetry and language, poetry and silence, language and sound, listening and reading, the eye and the ear; and the multi-dimensional opportunities of performance, live or digital. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter, and Melancholia illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of No Country for Old Men in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's Shalimar the Clown or Bahman Ghobadi's Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's The Submission, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior, Krakauer and Penn's Into the Wild, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary Gasland, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in Moonrise Kingdom, and imaginary places in films like After Life (Kore-eda Hirokazu), Micmacs (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and Marwencol (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In order to keep up with current work, the specific content of the course will change each year. We will study fiction and film in English and in translation (subtitled). In the past, the work of Salman Rushdie, Mario Vargas Llosa, Kamila Shamsie, Tash Aw, Shahrnush Parsipur, and Haruki Murakami has been included.  In addition to the assigned reading, we will screen and discuss an international film each week. By the end of the semester, thematic and stylistic links as well as the uniqueness of certain work, like Kore-eda Hirokazu's After Life, Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing, or Roy Andersson's You, the Living, will become apparent.

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WRITING, REVELATION, REVOLUTION: MAGICAL REALISM AS POST-COLONIAL DISCRS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Long associated with the experimentations of Latin American writers like Gabriel Garca Marquez and Alejo Carpentier, magical realism today has a global presence, and has been given an important place in the literatures of countries as diverse as India, Nigeria and Canada.  Perhaps because of this broad popularity, it is also often criticized as overly commercialized, exoticized fluff.  Yet its endurance as a model in both literature and the arts also suggests that it continues to offer an important way for writers to differentiate themselves from and critique mainstream culture, to give voice to marginalized realities in the wake of the homogenizing power of globalization and the mass media.  This course is organized around the following three goals: 1) to arrive at an understanding of what the term "magical realism" means by looking at the early writers and texts that made it world-renowned; 2) to examine a range of writers from different cultural contexts and regions, both inside and outside the Americas; 3) to analyze their work as it uses (and re-invents) the conventions of magical realism to make pointed political commentaries.  We will read fictional texts and essays and view a number of films and discuss how they link a magical realist aesthetic to a particular experience of land, history, family, and culture, in particular the folk, indigenous, and buried cultures and histories that challenge the "rationalism" of the northern urban centers. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Motion pictures (and television) have had a more tremendous impact on the American public mind than any other entertainment medium since the late 1890s. Film has profoundly influenced and perpetuated the constructed images of African-descended peoples across the world. This course explores the cultural, economic, political, and ideological motivations behind the problematic representation of "blacks" in cinema and television in the USA and other areas of the world while examining film as a genre with a vocabulary and idiom of its own.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINESE CINEMA: QUESTIONS OF NATIONALISM, REALISM, AND FILM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore Chinese Cinema as a national cinema and as a transnational cinema in both its popular and classic forms; however, the term 'Chinese' has been and is still a debated term among the very populations that lay claim to it, i.e., mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chinese diaspora, the People's Republic. These debates make the study of Chinese film a study of how to categorize or know film itself. In other words, exploring Chinese film in a Western critical arena within the hegemony of Western film studies begs theoretical questions about the very dominant and commonplace terms and perspectives used to examine all film in the 21st century, i.e, What are these films showing us?  What are we looking for?  What do we see?  Investigating these theoretical quandaries will also be a part of this course.  We will survey representative films produced before 1949, during the shift from of the cultural capital from Yan'an to Shanghai 1950-1964, during the Cultural Revolution (1964-1986), and during its emergence as the premier transnational cinema (late-1980s to 2000s).  We will also consider the particular film genres and film schools of Chinese cinema. Students will be responsible for reading critical and theoretical essays, viewing all required films, writing analytical papers on assigned topics, and presenting one oral sequence analysis.</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE nTH RACE: INTRODUCTION TO TRANSRACIALITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thanks to "advances" in medical and psychiatric technology, we are now able to view gender as a transformative aspect of life: we are not stuck in the sexed body with which we were born.  However, our racial identity is still something that seems biologically inescapable, in spite of the now very rich and convincing theoretical history of its constructed, non-essential nature.  While the history of transsexualism is marked by the potentially political affect of social transgression, the history of transraciality speaks to us from advertisements for skin-blanching creams, history-denying acts of racial passing, and community betrayal.  This is, however, contrary to the everyday experience which finds that individual and group racial identification is a process which is necessarily transracial: in declaring ourselves racially, we all cross boundaries set by societies contemporary and past.  In this course, we will attempt to reconfigure race through the discourse of transsexualism.  The "race" produced, thus like the "third" gender produced by transsexuality, will lead to a complication of existent preconceptions about racial stereotypes and formation.  We will use Deirdre N. McCloskey's &lt;i&gt;Crossing: a Memoir&lt;/i&gt; and the film &lt;i&gt;Paris is Burning&lt;/i&gt; to build a vocabulary of transsexualism from which we will read texts in which racial lines are crossed.  Among the required texts are: Frances Harper's &lt;i&gt;Iola Leroy&lt;/i&gt;, Andre Gide's &lt;i&gt;The Immoralist&lt;/i&gt;, Octavia Butler's &lt;i&gt;Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, and R.

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FICTION AND THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the 1990s Queer Theory emerged as a critique of the ways in which power institutionalizes and thereby legitimates certain forms of sexuality while marginalizing others.  Sue-Ellen Case, a performance theorist, claims that "queer theory works not at the site of gender, but at the site of ontology, to shift the ground of being itself. Queer revels constitute a kind of activism that attacks the dominate notion of the natural. The queer is the taboo-breaker, the monstrous, the uncanny" (quoted from Queer Theories). Through our readings of seminal queer theorists such Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gayle Rubin, we will explore important questions about the politics of queerness. Our investigation will focus on sexuality and gender, closeting, homophobia and drag, the aesthetics of queer literature, and the ways queer writers such as Leslie Feinberg, Kate Bornstein, and Randall Kenan interrogate and inscribe such subjects in their work.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: 'FROM MACONDO TO McONDO": THE BOOM AND BUST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN NOVEL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Associated for many years with the exoticism of magical realism (el boom), the Latin American novel has turned to the gritty realism of urban settings shaped by mass media and global corporate capitalism (McOndo).  In this course we will examine the political and cultural meaning of this shift in literary styles and focus.  The course begins with a short overview of magical realism to set the stage for our subsequent discussions.  The majority of the class, however, is dedicated to an examination of the contemporary writers and sub-genres that constitute the McOndo movement, including the noir crime novel, the crack generation, and the postmodern novel of biculturalism.  Authors may include: Alberto Fuguet, Giannina Braschi, Ignacio Padilla, and Paco Ignacio Taibo.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Starting off as a tongue-in-cheek, derivative expression used in the media, today "Bollywood" is increasingly becoming the dominant global description for the prolific Hindi language film industry based in Bombay (recently renamed Mumbai). This course provides a critical introduction to the cultural, social and political significance of this cinema with particular emphasis on recent films that have contributed to the emergence of the "Bollywood" phenomenon and its impact on national and global popular culture. The cinematic imagination and practices of "Bollywood" will be discussed in relation to ideas of nationalism, religion, gender and sexuality, urbanization and development, globalization and diaspora etc.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: CHICK THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When you are sitting on the bus reading &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt;, the act of reading becomes a performance: the particular cultural exchange value of this novel has the effect of feminizing your body, no matter what its biological makeup.  This is the work of a genre of fiction we call "Chick Lit."  With playfulness and rigor, this seminar will take up the mechanism of this genre into a feminist and theoretical content.  Hlne Cixous, Hortense J. Spillers, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Avital Ronell represent a group of feminist thinkers who have used fictionality in the craft of writing theory.  Studying these and other feminist theorists, we will delve into the functionality of fiction as gendering device by focusing on the craft of theorizing as a craft of fiction writing.  What are the ways in which theory can function as fiction?  What are the points of intersection between writing theory and writing fiction that can be used productively for the constitution of not just a feminine body, but a feminist consciousness?  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>METHODOLOGY/HISTORIOGRAPHY: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassa's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material: its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Register for PRINT-4525 and you will be added to this Art History class by the Registrar &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required &lt;br&gt; Registration begins on October 10 and ends on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.&lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course and its co-requisite (NMSE-1518-01) introduces students to patterns and connections in the social life and material culture of Istanbul - from past to present - through artifacts, architecture, design, environments, literature, people and spaces. The cross-disciplinary nature of this Studio + Liberal Arts course offers rigorous visual, critical and experimental inquiry focused in a historical and cultural framework with the benefit of site-specificity. Input and participation from students of ALL levels of the college and from ALL departments are desired.  	 &lt;BR&gt; For more than three millennia, the city of Istanbul has been a crossroad from East to West, North to South, and old to new. Although its strategic location straddling Europe and Asia has resulted in historic (and contemporary) conflicts between differing political, religious and economic interests, the ability of the citizens to absorb and adapt has allowed them to endure, resulting in a rich synthesis of ideologies, styles and practices. We will witness these layers of civilization through materials, structures and spaces and social situations that reveal transitions throughout Istanbul's history. As such, the city will be our laboratory for observing how humans continue to interact with places, things and ideas while providing an invaluable context for art, design, technology and social theorizing.  	 &lt;BR&gt; Following an aggressive schedule that will fuse studio practices and research components, this course includes lectures, readings, discussions and studio activity combined with extensive foot, bus, and ferry navigation of the many neighborhoods of Istanbul. A final studio-based project that grows from sketchbook, journal and other recorded observations will be executed in conjunction with a written, research component. Both elements of the final project will be considered for relevancy, cohesiveness and contextualization of the student's research topic. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Travel Costs: $3,700.00 - $4,500.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Corequisite: NMSE-1581 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEATER PRODUCTION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Professional actor/director Fred Sullivan (Trinity Repertory Company resident artist and RISD Acting Workshop instructor)  will guide a company of student actors, designers, stage managers, and construction crew through a workshop process of producing a live play for the stage, culminating in a weekend of public performances of the production. Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will address questions of how psychological and cognitive functions are produced by the brain. The field of cognitive neuroscience aims to link the mind, the brain and behavior by trying to understand the biological nature of human thought and behavior.  In this introductory course we will discuss several topics including: How is the brain built and how well can it rewire itself? How can we measure the living brain? What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We explore both narrative and nonfiction films and videotapes.  We write essays to establish critical standards.  We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEXUALITY &amp; SUBVERSION: FICTION &amp; FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Rope to Fried Green Tomatoes to Fight Club and beyond, 20th century mainstream American writers and filmmakers toyed with and hinted at-or even overtly confronted-the concept of homosexuality, often with mixed results. Critics, reviewers, and even scholars have generally labeled these popular texts "subversive," but were they? If so, to what extent and why? In order to explore these and other questions, we will initially investigate the term subversion (as opposed to transgression or "ludic play"), through theoretical texts and class discussions. We will then move on, to see how subversion might (or might not) work within and among the competing, complementary, and conflicting discourses in various texts. In addition to those listed above, the literary texts and films will likely include: Boys on the Side, The Women of Brewster Place, Single White Female, M. Butterfly, Truth or Dare, Madonna's Sex, The Object of My Affection, The Next Best Thing, and others.  At the semester's end, we will examine Brokeback Mountain as the 21st century's "answer" to the texts of the preceding century. Students will write several brief responses, give a class presentation, and take a midterm and final exam. In addition, students will need to acquire online or other access to the films.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXTREME FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most mainstream fiction is realist in form and narrative in style. These stories generally have a beginning, middle and end, and adhere to a formula that includes rising action, climax, and denouement. The fictions we will examine in this course, however, may have few or none of those qualities:  they may be nonrealist, nonnarrative, postmodern, or fall somewhere between and among these categories, but they provide a counterpoint and challenge to preconceived notions of what a story ought to look like, how it should unfold, and even what relationship the readers should have to the text. We will begin the course with some more traditional stories and then move directly into examining alternative fictions. The readings will likely be selected from texts written by the following authors: Donald Barthelme, Kathy Acker, Italo Calvino, Ishmael Reed, Pamela Zoline, Angela Carter, Ursula LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Dixon, Michael Wilkerson, Karen Brennan, and others. In addition to the readings, students will be required to give a presentation (with at least one other member of the class), write several responses, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ITALY AND THE AMERICAN LITERARY IMAGINATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course centers on three interrelated American fiction writers--- Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, and Edith Wharton---who imaginatively use settings in Italy to develop complex characters and plots. Reading Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, Henry James' Daisy Miller, The Portrait of a Lady and/or The Wings of the Dove, and Edith Wharton's short stories such as The Eyes and Roman Fever, we will explore the rich aesthetic and psychological components of fiction dealing with Americans encountering Italian culture.  Since the visual arts---painting, sculpture, and architecture-play a significant role in each of the texts we read, they will be a part of our focus.  Students will keep journals, write three analytical papers, and take a final exam.  Students may choose to construct a final project (including a strong written dimension) that will substitute for the final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ECOPOEMS/ECOPOETICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At the beginning of an interview with poets Robert Hass, Brenda Hillman, Evelyn Reilly, and Jonathan Skinner, Angela Hulme writes that, although nature and environment have long been inspirational for poets, "today, amidst mounting scientific evidence of ecological disturbance-with key indicators now signaling a changing climate, a global water crisis, and the decline or disappearance of numerous wildlife species-many poets are engaging with their environments and with the question of human environmental impact in increasingly critical ways."  In this course we will examine a range of texts and practices in order to survey the state of contemporary North American ecopoetry/ecopoetics.  Course activities will include reading, analyzing, and discussing ecopoems and critical essays on ecopoems and ecopoetics; regular writing assignments; and the development of a personal ecopoetics practice.  Although the ecopoems and ecopoetics texts we will study in class all use writing as their medium, we will also consider what it might look like to migrate an ecopoetics practice into visual realms.  Students need not have previous training in creative writing to participate in this course.  &lt;BR&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How do directors transform fiction into film?  In this course we'll see several films and read the novels on which they're based. We'll talk about the ways in which their makers use two very different art forms to render the same (or is it?) material.  Taped interviews with contemporary directors, actors, cinematographers and writers will let us hear from the artists themselves. Coursework includes readings, video screenings, discussions, exercises, and a final project. Warning: The course involves a good deal of writing, and the films are sexually explicit.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUNK CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the punk-new wave musical revolution was brewing in the mid 1970s, underground filmmakers were also embracing the punk spirit of experimentation, a do-it-yourself ethos, and an uneasy, often defiant relationship with all things authoritative or mainstream. This course will trace and map the contours of punk cinema, from its roots in neorealism and the French New Wave, to its branches in the No Wave and Cinema of Transgression movements of the early 1980s. Time permitting, we?ll look forward to the post-punk era to consider how the legacy of punk informs later film movements such as Dogme 95.  Directors we?ll encounter may include: Amos Poe, Alex Cox, Derek Jarman, Slava Tsukerman, Lars von Trier, and Penelope Spheeris. While not a prerequisite, some background in critical film theory will be beneficial in this course, as will a commitment to academic reading, writing, and lively discussion.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EKPHRASIS AND ITS REVERSE: WRITING FROM ART, ART FROM WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Here's Marcel Proust on his love of art: "Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves, to know what another person sees of a universe which is not the same as our own." Instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists. I want to do something similar in this course: to encourage students to see visual art in terms of writing and writing in terms of visual art, and thus to inspire them in their own studio practice and writing. Students will write creative texts related to their artistic interests or the work of the artists who inspire them and will create art in response to literary texts. We will read various writers (Rilke, Proust, WH Auden, Frank O'Hara - many others) who have been influenced by visual artists, and vice-versa. We will explore questions of narrative, framing, place, autobiography, appropriation, metaphor and symbol, truth and realism, irony, and so on. How can a poem or piece of fiction 'tell the story' of a sculpture or painting? How can a painting 'translate' a passage from Proust, a short story by Kafka or a poem by Elizabeth Bishop? How can it fail, and how are these failures interesting? What is lost in translation between art and literature, and what does this say about the singularity of each medium?  Our overarching aim will be to inspire students through a series of juxtapositions (looking at the similarities between negative space in painting and 'silences' in literature, for example), and to encourage them to engage with and find inspiration in ideas and methods from fields beyond their major.</COURSEDESC>

A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: ENGL E412 Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience.&lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite or class level does not apply when course is offered during wintersession.&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These short prose pieces draw from both fiction and poetry, yet they are finally neither, another literary beast altogether.  As befits a hybrid form, this will be a hybrid course.  We will survey notable works in the development of the prose poem and short-short story with an eye toward what the form has become today.  We will respond to this material through short analytical essays as well as prose poems and short-short stories of our own.  Through discussion of published work and workshops of our own writing we will gain a clearer insight into what this strange, playful form can do.</COURSEDESC>

We will focus extensively on the 19th and early 20th centuries, the heyday of human exhibitions, and move forward to current modes of display, which both contest and refigure earlier spectacles. Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>
