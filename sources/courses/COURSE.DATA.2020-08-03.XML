   <COURSETITLE>CLIMATE CHANGE AND NATURAL HAZARDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscape architects and designers in other disciplines are taking an increasingly important role in addressing complex questions related to climate change and natural hazards.  These questions involve intersecting cultural and scientific issues.  This course is designed to equip landscape architects and other designers with an essential foundation in physical and social scientific aspects of climate change so that they may better engage with these questions.  Although it is impossible to cover the breadth of necessary topics and issues in a single semester, students will learn to analyze and access the scientific literature so that they can individually extend their education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Emphasis will also be placed on essential skills and disciplinary approaches to enable more effective collaboration in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary contexts.  This includes addressing cultural and disciplinary differences in approaches to scientific concepts such as validity and uncertainty, and examining epistemological aspects of science.  This course is an essential primer in climate change and natural hazards for any student who hopes to address these issues in their work or to work in policy based contexts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open undergraduates only; sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as LAEL-2012; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN RESEARCH IN THE SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Artists and designers working on issues involving the sciences (e.g., global environmental change, environmental justice, human perception) routinely cross disciplinary boundaries to create new work that incorporates scientific knowledge. This course is designed to support students seeking to engage the sciences and to help students better understand the relationship between their practice-based education and other conventions of knowledge creation. The course has two primary focuses: &lt;br&gt; 1) Assisting students with individual research, including the development of a research question, background, and statement of how disciplinary knowledge in the sciences relates to their art and design practice.  &lt;br&gt; 2) Exploring the changing basis of legitimacy for knowledge in different disciplinary contexts. &lt;br&gt; At the end of the course students will be equipped with a background document suitable for use in grant proposals, be better able to present and articulate their art and design ideas to collaborators in the sciences, and better understand the different approaches scientific collaborators take to addressing research and societal problems.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE USES OF ANIMALS IN RELATION TO THE INDUSTRY OF MAN: DESIGN AND NATURE, 1851 AND NOW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This hybrid studio-elective course will follow a  series of twelve lectures given at the South  Kensington Museum as published in P.L. Simmonds,  Animal Products. This seminal work served as a  compilation of the trade exhibition collections  from the 1851 Crystal Palace exposition that  eventually served as the seed for the collections  of the South Kensington Museum and finally the  Branch Museum of the Department at Bethnal Green.  These collections laid the foundation for much of  the Victoria and Albert Museum collections (V&amp;A)  that in turn influenced the creation of RISD and  the RISD Museum in 1877.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will examine design and fashion,  naturalist journals, and literature as a means to  develop the students design vocabulary and  materials palate. Students will compare the  tastes and techniques of the Victorian era to  contemporary design practices, with case studies  of designers utilizing the natural world as a  resource and source for design. Weekly lectures  will introduce students to artists and designers  of the 19th century  and compare them to  contemporary artists and designers. These  introductory lectures will be paired each week  with a specific material examination and hand-on  exploration via materials demonstrations and a  sample notebook. We will engage in readings,  group discussions, critique of student  "Naturalist Journals," materials demonstrations,  and examine historic and contemporary Museum  objects within each theme material.  &lt;BR&gt; Field trips to the RISD Museum will be augmented  by visits to the Edna W. Lawrence Nature Lab,  RISD Materials library, The Providence Athenaeum,  The Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown  University, The New Bedford Whaling Museum, and  The Museum of Natural History, Roger Williams  Park.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost:  $20.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to Apparel Design majors only; sophomore and  above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and  permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN FASHION THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Topics in Fashion Theory" complements the design history survey, "History of Dress." ("History of Dress" is not a prerequisite). This seminar will introduce students to theoretical debates in fashion theory, responding to scholars who define fashion as the cultural construction of embodied identity. Through the manipulation of the visual and tactile symbols of clothing (cut, cloth, texture and color) fashion expresses, however imprecisely, a configuration of individual attributes and attitudes that persons seek to communicate. But fashion most likely productively draws upon "recurrent instabilities" in collective social identities, argues Fred Davis, including masculinity versus femininity, androgyny versus singularity, license versus restraint and conformity versus rebellion. Fashion can do so because social identities are rarely the stable amalgams we take them to be: they shift over the course of a lifetime and are prodded by social and technological change. Drawing on scholarship in a range of disciplines, including sociology, cultural studies, gender studies and queer theory, we will explore clothing's role in marking, or alternately containing, deflecting or sublimating, those aspects of identity linked to gender, sexuality, class, race, religion and nation. Noting that leading designers use the catwalk to present experimental clothes that often communicate brand values and the designer's identity, we will explore the extent to which fashion is currently formulating effective social commentary. &lt;BR&gt; The class integrates reading and reading responses with discussion and visual analysis of clothing and fashion across the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries. Reading responses will help students develop four short written projects that assess and analyze debates encountered in class discussion and readings. Class time will include in-class writing and peer review. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Apparel majors only; sophomore and above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE USES OF ANIMALS IN RELATION TO THE INDUSTRY OF MAN: DESIGN AND NATURE, 1851 AND NOW</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This hybrid studio-elective course will follow a  series of twelve lectures given at the South  Kensington Museum as published in P.L. Simmonds,  Animal Products. This seminal work served as a  compilation of the trade exhibition collections  from the 1851 Crystal Palace exposition that  eventually served as the seed for the collections  of the South Kensington Museum and finally the  Branch Museum of the Department at Bethnal Green.  These collections laid the foundation for much of  the Victoria and Albert Museum collections (V&amp;A)  that in turn influenced the creation of RISD and  the RISD Museum in 1877.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will examine design and fashion,  naturalist journals, and literature as a means to  develop the students design vocabulary and  materials palate. Students will compare the  tastes and techniques of the Victorian era to  contemporary design practices, with case studies  of designers utilizing the natural world as a  resource and source for design. Weekly lectures  will introduce students to artists and designers  of the 19th century  and compare them to  contemporary artists and designers. These  introductory lectures will be paired each week  with a specific material examination and hand-on  exploration via materials demonstrations and a  sample notebook. We will engage in readings,  group discussions, critique of student  "Naturalist Journals," materials demonstrations,  and examine historic and contemporary Museum  objects within each theme material.  &lt;BR&gt; Field trips to the RISD Museum will be augmented  by visits to the Edna W. Lawrence Nature Lab,  RISD Materials library, The Providence Athenaeum,  The Haffenreffer Museum of Anthropology at Brown  University, The New Bedford Whaling Museum, and  The Museum of Natural History, Roger Williams  Park.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost:  $20.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to Apparel Design majors only; sophomore and  above &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and  permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WOOD STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will review the fundamentals of wood in architecture with a focus on wood materials and construction systems and lumber and timber structural analysis and design.  Work includes timber systems consisting of conventional framing trusses, laminates, built-up sections and connections. In addition, this course will review the principles of structural loads; gravity, lateral, live and dead.  The concept of lateral resistance through standard wood framing systems will be explored. Manufactured lumber has become a major part of today's wood construction industry and the design and detailing of these materials will be explored in depth. By the end of the course, students will be aware of the role of wood materials in architectural design and construction and be able to design and detail simple Lumber and Timber structural systems.  They will be able to proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis. This course will provide the student with a good understanding of the material and the common structural and architectural systems used in today's practice. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major Requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by the Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The deliverables for this stuminar will be twofold: a thoroughly researched, documented, and delineated design project; and a textual 'exit document' in which students articulate their research methods, techniques, formats, and outcomes.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on computational topics pertaining to architecture. Computational techniques and computational ideas are explored through making, writing, reading, and discussion. Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; For Fall and Spring Semesters:  &lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to CTC Concentrators and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; For Wintersession:  &lt;br&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD ARCHITECTURE: FROM PRE-HISTORY TO PRE-MODERN: IDEAS AND ARTIFACTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This history of architecture course, co-taught by an architectural historian and an architect, introduces key ideas, forces, and techniques that have shaped world architecture through the ages prior to the modern period. The course is based on critical categories, ranging from indigenous and vernacular architecture, to technology, culture, and representation. The lectures and discussions present systems of thought, practice and organization, emphasizing both historical and global interconnectedness, and critical architectural differences and anomalies. Each topic will be presented through case studies accompanied by relevant texts. The students will be expected to engage in the discussion groups, prepare material for these discussions, write about, and be examined on the topics. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors &lt;BR&gt; Art History credit for Architecture majors &lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Theory offerings in the architecture department are deliberately consistent or complementary with our pedagogy, born and raised in an arts college. Theory based courses have a basis in empiricism, direct observation and experience of creative processes. Recognizing that discovery and invention often come between existing matrices of thought, offerings may be from disciplines other than architecture or branches of knowledge other than art and design. &lt;br&gt;  Objectives of the theory component of our curriculum are to: &lt;br&gt; 1. Expand the capacity to speculate productively.&lt;br&gt; 2. Develop the skeptic's eye and mind.&lt;br&gt; 3. Equip the ability to recognize connections that trigger discovery and invention. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE SEMINAR: DISCIPLINARITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Anyone following contemporary debates in architecture knows that there are as many definitions of architecture's disciplinarity as there are people who attempt to define it. In the current spate of publications on this topic, Mark Jarzombek declares architecture to be a failed discipline; Jane Rendell claims that architecture is a 'subject' subsuming several disciplines; Mark Wigley ruminates upon the prosthetic nature of the discipline to the sciences; Bob Somol and Sarah Whiting attempt to recover a Foucaultian disciplinarity in which norms, principles and traditions are supplanted by performative practice; Akos Moravansky argues that the disciplinarity of architecture resists the discursive approach embodied in post-1968 theory; Keller Easterling seeks "the trapdoor into another habit of mind" by eschewing narrow categories of thought for more inclusive ones; Sylvia Lavin uses the analogy of the 'kiss' between an installation and the architecture that houses it as a model of architectural inter-disciplinarity as media interaction; and Hal Foster and Michael Speaks face off on the relative merits of design intelligence and critical distance. How can a student of architecture ever gain a foothold in this complex and confusing debate? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; At stake in the debates over disciplinarity is the question: how can we identify architecture's categories of knowledge, and how did the categorization of knowledge become a priority? This Disciplinarity seminar will historically situate the circumstances of architecture's emerging disciplinarity, and thematize it through three seemingly disparate but operatively identical lenses: the aesthetic, the historic, and the technological. Although the debates cited above appear unruly at first blush, fundamentally they aggregate around the relative merits of defining disciplinary categories of knowledge either too narrowly or too broadly, focusing either on architecture's autonomy or its extra-disciplinary appropriations. In addition to architecture's various categories of knowledge, the seminar will consider the influence of disciplinarity on our practices, considering how various classifications of architectural knowledge affect its techniques, standards, and formats of dissemination. From its Foucaultian framing to its current incarnations, Disciplinarity will unpack the construction of architecture's disciplinarity, and shed some much-needed light on what it means for architects to be disciplinary.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH 3-year only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MODELS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores multiple forms digital models and their relationships to drawings, materials, and buildings.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course uses abstraction as the common thread between its prerequisite, "Drawings," and an inquiry into the elements, natures, structures, and forms of the complex, temporal, cultural, material and political construct often referred to as "the building." The model's role is understood as a medium for operations. The contemporary digital model is delimited and constrained by architectural software. This course recognizes that expertise in multiple digital modeling software-including those aligned with Building Information Modeling (BIM), fabrication, and animation-is as imperative as are skills to manipulate, undermine, link, automate and hack the media that dominate the discipline of architecture. As is the case with "Drawings," models are not merely technical, but the underpinnings of an iterative, creative, synthetic and reflective creative process. A series of prompts engage the computational principles that underpin all digital modeling software. This "under the hood" approach is balanced by "over the hood" approaches that see students designing workflows, automation and output between software and material. The course engages the digital model as sample, system, and database as well as continually interrogates the translational relationship between model and drawing and model and image.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $340.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Deparmtent, course not avialable via web registration.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The second core studio addresses the agency of the building to simultaneously construct new spatial, social, and material orders in the context of the contemporary city.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The second core studio situates architecture as the strategic interplay of spatial and constructive concepts towards specific aesthetic, social, and performative ends. The studio seeks to create a productive friction between abstract orders (form, pattern, organization), technical systems (structure, envelope), and the contingencies of real-world conditions (site, politics, environment). The studio operates within a specific cultural framework in which students link disciplinary methods to extra-disciplinary issues, with concentrated forays into the realms of structure, material, environmentalism, and urbanism. Students iteratively develop architectural concepts, ethical positions, and experimental working methods through a series of focused architectural design projects with increasing degrees of complexity, culminating in the design of a mid-scale public building in an urban context.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $195.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend.

   <COURSEDESC>This course brings together printmaking and architecture, with their respective modes of working and sensibilities. There is long tradition connecting the two disciplines; here we will focus on a fundamental, physical connection, experimenting with materials and ways of assembling them to make prints. We will think of the press bed almost as a construction site. Collecting materials from everyday life, we will explore their characteristics and qualities--textures, patterns, opacities and translucencies--in the process of transferring them onto paper. The main technique of the course will be monotype, but we may also employ other techniques, such as soft ground, collagraph, and laser etching depending of students' experience and interest. We will start with simple monochrome prints, progressively moving to more open-ended, elaborate and ambitious experiments, including multicolor prints and three-dimensional assemblages. Students will produce weekly sets of prints exploring themes and variations. Above all, the work of the course should be thought of as an opportunity to develop careful experimental habits.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $60.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2080: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; PRINT-2080: Open to Printmaking majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2080: Open to all other majors.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

And, what do these architects' accomplishments and the challenges they face reveal about the intersections of architecture, sexism, racism, colonization, and globalization?  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; These thematic questions will guide students through the case studies of 13 female, non-American, mostly non-white architects. Weekly readings will offer in depth study of well-known figures, such as Lina Bo Bardi, and significant, but lesser known architects such as Nadia Tromp, the managing director of Ntsika Architects, a 100% black, female-owned practice in South Africa. Students will conclude the course by writing a term paper on contemporary female architecture. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN FARMING &amp; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3-credit elective studio seminar fulfills RISD's goal for meaningful community engagement by recognizing the power of affiliating with members of our Providence community on urban agriculture and permaculture initiatives. The course seeks to introduce the history of organic farming and explore the developments in contemporary urban practices.  Students will acquire an understanding of the topic through field demonstrations and case study analysis which will lead up to work on a small-scale design build initiative for a community garden with a local partner. &lt;br&gt; Social justice extends to the environmental issues in multiple ways. Providence, Rhode Island, is made up of diverse communities where, in 2015, more than 1 in 5 children in Providence have grown up in poverty, with a medium household income of $34,000 or less.  There are many local non-profits that serve our communities including with urban farming activities that provide fresh food and places to gather. Urban agriculture has the potential to strengthen local communities and has many social benefits including economic development through food production and other activities in the food network, reducing food deserts, enhancing food security, the reduction of the use of fossil-fuels, and the transformation of urban environments through the introduction of the green spaces that highlight the nutrient cycle.  Urban farming creates more sustainable urban environments by re-establishing interrelated natural systems, promoting biodiversity and reducing urban impact on the water cycle. Finally, these spaces can become a locus for community where youth and adults can engage natural systems though passive or active undertakings and educational uses.    &lt;br&gt; Academia has an important role to play in advancing these community efforts. We will look at appropriate methods of community engagement and Creative Placemaking to explore how design can play a role in nurturing culturally-diverse vibrant neighborhoods while creating positive change.  We will work closely with local community partners, such as the FarmFresh RI, Southside Community Land Trust and the African Alliance of RI to understand and support their work through creative thinking.    &lt;br&gt; Each student will be asked to prepare two projects. The first will be a case study analysis of existing examples of urban farms across the country to learn from the unique ways people are farming in different cities. In the second project, we will work with our community partners in the field to design and build a small project that will be part of an existing garden. Finally, we will document the process that emerges through community conversations in order to share our process and results.  &lt;br&gt; At the end of the semester students will be required to participate in two build sessions outside of class period at the project site as part of course work. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Please follow the below registration availability: &lt;BR&gt; ARCH-2340: Open to Architecture majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; INTAR-2340: Open to Interior Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; LDAR-2340: Open to Landscape Architecture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; IDISC-2340: Open to all majors.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN FARMING &amp; COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3-credit elective studio seminar fulfills RISD's goal for meaningful community engagement by recognizing the power of affiliating with members of our Providence community on urban agriculture and permaculture initiatives. The course seeks to introduce the history of organic farming and explore the developments in contemporary urban practices.  Students will acquire an understanding of the topic through field demonstrations and case study analysis which will lead up to work on a small-scale design build initiative for a community garden with a local partner. &lt;br&gt; Social justice extends to the environmental issues in multiple ways. Providence, Rhode Island, is made up of diverse communities where, in 2015, more than 1 in 5 children in Providence have grown up in poverty, with a medium household income of $34,000 or less.  There are many local non-profits that serve our communities including with urban farming activities that provide fresh food and places to gather. Urban agriculture has the potential to strengthen local communities and has many social benefits including economic development through food production and other activities in the food network, reducing food deserts, enhancing food security, the reduction of the use of fossil-fuels, and the transformation of urban environments through the introduction of the green spaces that highlight the nutrient cycle.

   <COURSEDESC>The second core studio addresses the agency of the building to simultaneously construct new spatial, social, and material orders in the context of the contemporary city.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The second core studio situates architecture as the strategic interplay of spatial and constructive concepts towards specific aesthetic, social, and performative ends. The studio seeks to create a productive friction between abstract orders (form, pattern, organization), technical systems (structure, envelope), and the contingencies of real-world conditions (site, politics, environment). The studio operates within a specific cultural framework in which students link disciplinary methods to extra-disciplinary issues, with concentrated forays into the realms of structure, material, environmentalism, and urbanism. Students iteratively develop architectural concepts, ethical positions, and experimental working methods through a series of focused architectural design projects with increasing degrees of complexity, culminating in the design of a mid-scale public building in an urban context.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $195.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH only.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department,  course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course reviews the role of metals in architecture, focusing on the fundamentals of steel analysis and design in architecture;  and examines typical framing techniques and systems. Topics  include construction issues, floor framing systems, column analysis  and design, steel detailing and light gauge steel framing materials and systems.  In addition the course introduces students to lateral force  resistance systems in steel construction and exposes them to alternatives to steel such as aluminum and fiberglass. By the end of the course,  students will be aware of the role of metals in architectural design and construction; design and detail simple steel structural systems; and proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The study of basic concepts of Human Environmental Comforts. Inherent within 'physio-environ' considerations are principles of temperature, humidity, heat transfer, air movement, and hydrostatics. These principles will be studied in terms of their abstract physics and mathematics, through empirical benchmarking and as the basis for a design proposal that includes considerations of larger scale strategies as well as assemblies. Emphasis will be placed on the principles behind the technology, the behavioral characteristics and the qualities of the systems' operation considered in making building design decisions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Open to NCSS Concentrators pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.  &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This internship can count for NCARB Architectural Experience Program AX-P.   The internship hours for ARCH-2199 can be used towards architecture licensure through the NCARB Internship. Student's intent upon becoming registered architects in the USA after graduation should enroll in the AXP as soon as possible.  AXP is the internship program required by all registration jurisdictions. The work experience accomplished during ARCH-2199, the department's minimum Internship experience (280 hours) can be recorded as acceptable experience in the AXP (3740 hours) and thus accelerate one's pace towards architectural licensure. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Website: http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internship  s.aspx  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; To register, go to www.risdcareers.com (ArtWorks) &lt;BR&gt; Course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will utilize the content, topic, and conceit of measure as a pinhole through which to see the world of Directed Design Research. Directed Design Research is an alternative to Thesis, which lays out a specific territory of inquiry and encourages students to identify the topic and scope of their work, emanating from this specific point of departure. The seminar will lay out a series of methods, techniques, and exercises related to the exploration of measure, asking each student to then define a territory of inquiry within this delimited field. The deliverables for the Scope Seminar include a thoughtfully delimited and actionable statement of the intended design research, the documentation of a minimum of three methodologies or approaches to be utilized in the design research, and a well-wrought syllabus that includes: a weekly breakdown of tasks and deliverables, relevant references and precedents properly cited, and a concise text (3 pages maximum) describing the research activities to be undertaken. &lt;br&gt; Major requirement; Architecture majors only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a theoretical seminar course that will be concerned with ideas and architectural knowledge that may be cultivated and tested through discourse.  The course discussions will focus on an expansive role of architectural tools. While acknowledging a wealth of disciplinary conventions, histories and theories, this course recognizes that the forms of representation within the discipline of architecture have the capacity to affect the discipline of architecture and are not fixed. Students in this course will be expected to build upon their previous architectural education through a series of directed projects aimed at advancing architectural theories, ideas and methods. Some of the questions that students will be expected to address are: What are the practical, theoretical, and creative implications of a drawing that functions as architecture? How do architects change the way we make and think thanks to digital media? How do architects represent and model natural forces?  How do architects express political or social agendas?  What is the nature of an architectural contribution to interdisciplinary discourse? How can representation enable new kinds of artistic and research-based practices for architecture? Students will be expected to self-direct their process while framing their work intellectually in a seminar environment. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; M.ARCH 2-year only &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on drawing topics pertaining to architecture. Drawing is treated as a space for architectural research and/or as an autonomous work of architecture. The notion that drawing serves architecture merely as representation is questioned and critiqued. The theoretical and technical focus on the process of drawing will cultivate and address issues that have for hundreds of years served as the core of the architecture discipline. Simultaneously, the research may allow for the generation or assimilation of ideas, cultures and knowledge from other fields into architecture. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $20.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Theory offerings in the architecture department are deliberately consistent or complementary with our pedagogy, born and raised in an arts college. Theory based courses have a basis in empiricism, direct observation and experience of creative processes. Recognizing that discovery and invention often come between existing matrices of thought, offerings may be from disciplines other than architecture or branches of knowledge other than art and design. &lt;br&gt;  Objectives of the theory component of our curriculum are to: &lt;br&gt; 1. Expand the capacity to speculate productively.&lt;br&gt; 2. Develop the skeptic's eye and mind.&lt;br&gt; 3. Equip the ability to recognize connections that trigger discovery and invention. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Restricted to Architecture majors junior and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*MEXICO: MATERIAL PROPOSITIONS: OAXACA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Oaxaca City is situated in the mountains midway between Mexico City and the Pacific coast of Mexico. It is a World Heritage Site designated by UNESCO in recognition of its historic buildings and archaeological sites. The city's colonial history is intertwined with indigenous cultures that reside along the city edges. It is also the source of a rich contemporary art scene rooted in the current political and social climate of the area. Home to an extensive network of art centers, cultural institutions, and artisanal crafts, the place provides a rich inventory of opportunities for material observation, experimentation, and making.  &lt;br&gt; The primary focus of the studio is to weave together cultural research, material exploration, and full-scale construction to explore the resonance between traditional craft practices and contemporary techniques of design. Students will be exposed to materials based on the vernacular of the area-adobe, stone, brick, lime, bamboo, and locally made encaustic tiles-and introduced to ways in which to translate their properties into new applications and processes of assembly. The goal is to engage participants in the design of a collaborative project while understanding the culture and interests of the community it will serve. These hands-on explorations will be facilitated by community-based partners in the spirit of generating local innovation.   &lt;br&gt; The secondary component of the course will provide an opportunity for observation and visual transcription of experience through drawing and other forms of 2-D material work informed by local resources. Fieldwork will be supported by visits to cultural sites, and daily discussions will address the use of materials in design as a force to promote reimagining their applications. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio. A minimum GPA of 2.50 is required. Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $2,180.00 - airfare  not included. &lt;br&gt;  ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS DISCURSIVE WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thesis Discursive Workshop utilizes Wintersession to hone students' discursive skills, both written and oral, so that they can choreograph a robust discussion around their work. This course establishes a consistent discursive trajectory to the ongoing individual design development of the thesis project that begins in the Fall. In addition to providing a forum in which students might draw out, articulate, and position some of the central claims and aims of their thesis work, this course also aims to instigate careful thought about the written component of the eventual thesis book and the way that this written component might inform or be informed by design work. The assignments of the course are designed to create the infrastructure of a student's eventual thesis book, the elements of any/many book(s). They are not the book content itself, but organize, clarify, define, contextualize, reference, etc. the work contained therein. These elements, for the purposes of this course, are: synopsis (back page/cover flap summary), "cover art", bibliography, table of contents, title, index, and appendix/appendices. In this five-week intensive workshop, students will develop and refine the following skills, relating each development to a component of their eventual book via an assignment:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. Crafting the thesis polemic or narrative;  &lt;BR&gt; 2. Positioning the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 3. Contextualizing and formatting the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 4. Curating and editing the thesis;  &lt;BR&gt; 5.

   <COURSETITLE>CORE 3 STUDIO: CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At a moment marked by the increasing homogenization and inaccessibility of cities, we will examine and generate urban experiments that represent radical forms of inclusion and place-making.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; If we reject the premise that contemporary cities are facilitators of extractive regimes, then we can analyze urban experiments that represent alternative forms of coexistence between humans, non-humans, and their expansive environments. This studio examines cities as negotiators between systems of inclusion and exclusion. Systems of inclusion will be sampled from multiple cities and societies, with diverse social orders and forms of place-making. This robust archive of socio- spatial concepts will be edited, combined, and tested on a specific site of contestation. We will investigate visible and invisible forms of infrastructure as opportunities to establish new platforms for cultural production; expanding contemporary sustainability discourse through the intersection of social, political, and economic asymmetries. The aim is to develop a critical framework for our ongoing construction and conception of cities.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $210.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate major requirements; M.ARCH only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE DRAWING OF THINGS: AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There is no way to make a drawing-there is only drawing. -Richard Serra  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Much of the pleasure of drawing is in the act-the process of its unfolding. The Drawing of Things provides an opportunity to experiment with a variety of simple procedures that can lead to the creation of powerful works. The semester revolves around the making of drawings in various materials and processes guided by the organizational principles of the grid and notions of repetition. The exploration of constructed images undertakes the following topics: surface, materials, mark-making, composition, space, scale, time, and memory. These parameters provide guidance to an otherwise open set of personal investigations made by hand. This tactile connection with the work brings back the human touch, the eye and hand working together, control, concentration, and the language of marking marks.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The formation of images-the configuration of marks on a surface in primarily two-dimensional composition-is informed by three notions: (1) the selection of materials, (2) the manner in which marks are arranged, and (3) intentionality.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; All makers of things start from positions unique to themselves and discover the potential of work empirically through rigorous process, critical awareness and intuition. Ultimately, the medium of drawing is physical, quiet, and an introspective activity-a means to bring forth material/spatial relationships that reveal personality, a manner of looking, decision-making, and intuitive sensibilities.  The workshop takes form through weekly projects and readings. There is no better way to learn than by doing, so with this in mind, advice and direction beyond the hand-outs will be kept to a minimum. You have your own sensibilities to guide you, and its up to you to supply the desire to make things and the curiosity to try out different possibilities.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $40.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Ceramics and printmaking have a shared ethos in the production of multiples and process-driven technical methods. This is reflected in industry but is not often explored in an academic context. This course would be the first at RISD to explore the rich resources of the Ceramics and Printmaking Departments to promote research into innovative ways to combine the disciplines. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; For almost three centuries ceramics have been enhanced by printed elements. The combination of ceramic and print technologies have tremendous potential for new applications in functional and sculptural approaches to ceramic multiples and printed editions. RISD has all the facilities in ceramics and printmaking required to pursue research in this field. Students will learn ceramic techniques such as hand-building and slip casting to create forms to hold screen printed, intaglio, relief, and digital images. Historical techniques will be presented and new methods and combinations will be developed. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to all students; juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as PRINT-3208; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH STUDIO: TECHNOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Participants in the Technological Landscapes research group are passionate but critical observers of today's living environment in relation to ubiquitous, integrated, and emerging technologies. It is important that we draw inspiration not necessarily just from art, design, but from real-world events influenced or caused by technological advancement and/or failure.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This research group will foster a dynamic, and highly collaborative environment through discussions, readings and excursions. Participants are expected to drive and determine the focus and interests of the group through conversations and consensus. In turn this will feed each participant's artistic sensibility and will form the conceptual foundations necessary for building a strong critical art work. Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  The projects, individual or collaborative, should be thought of on a scale of landscape physical or virtual. One is encouraged to exploit the imaginative, speculate possible near futures and position them where the poetic crosses between science fiction and the built reality. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Each year the group works together to locate and secure an exhibition space and or develop a site-specific work within the site/topic of study for that year. Each year the site/topic of focus changes, please contact faculty for current information.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $200.00  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required. Course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Please contact the Instructor with any questions and for more details. &lt;BR&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WEB ART AS SITE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course addresses the history and practice of art/literature made for and inseparable from the web, while teaching basic coding (in HTML, CSS, and jQuery), web-VR frameworks, and AI collaboration tools.   Web art is space/ place/ landscape/ setting/ site; it is not held or beheld, but filled and inhabited. So, while exploring the growing canon of web art, we will also consider a broader tradition of site-building or site-altering art practices, including installation, performance, and video games. Questioning what it means for art to occupy space, we will focus on work by web artists whose bodies have not historically owned or controlled physical sites in the US. In the first half of the course, students will make one mini-project each week, reflecting new technical skills. Students will then focus on a larger web artwork (either a website or a "web intervention"), for which they will independently develop their technical skills. For all sites, students will be encouraged to deploy language, music, video, painting, and/or any other media, as experts or novices. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

Critical attention is given to code as a body of crafted text with significant aesthetic, philosophical, and social dimensions, as well as the tension, conflict, and potential possible when computation generates, informs, or interacts with drawings, materials, forms, and spaces. Historical and contemporary works of computational art and design will be presented and assigned for analysis. This course is open to students of all majors and is designed for those with little or no experience in programming. In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer. This course fulfills one of two core studio requirements for CTC Concentration.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt; Apply during registration period using the form found here: https://goo.gl/forms/oARSYmuhjYrNczVZ2 or go to ctc.risd.edu. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE MATERIALS OF DRAWING: TECHNICAL RESEARCH AND PRACTICE IN HISTORICAL METHODS AND CONTEMPORARY APPLICATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over thousands of years, the materials and methods of drawing have evolved in response to the needs of artists and designers. Technical manuals, patents and other texts record specific drawing techniques. Research into these sources will lead to making actual drawing materials - inks, quill pens, grounds for metal point, chalks, etc. - which will be tested through a range of personal drawing projects and copies of historical works. Trials of newly available drawing materials will yield information about potential uses and permanency. Best practices for care and display of drawings will be covered throughout the course. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $90.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to undergraduates only; sophomore and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO: SPATIAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Design promotes multidisciplinary studio experimentation across an array of media and processes. Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Spatial Dynamics is a studio-based inquiry into physical, spatial and temporal phenomena.  The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

Through a rigorous studio practice, students are expected to identify and develop their own conceptual interests and material approaches.  Individual and group critiques support, facilitate, and intensify this process. While drawing concentrators will be given priority, interested students outside of the concentration and beyond the sophomore level may take this course. For the drawing concentrator, the work created for the Independent Drawing Project serves as the culmination of the Drawing Concentration program. Critiques will run from 6-9 pm, followed by independent studio work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to graduate students by permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Introduction to Computation focuses on computational techniques, methods, and ideas in the context of art and design. Studio projects first center on the design of algorithms then shift to involve computer programming and scripting. Critical attention is given to code as a body of crafted text with significant aesthetic, philosophical, and social dimensions, as well as the tension, conflict, and potential possible when computation generates, informs, or interacts with drawings, materials, forms, and spaces. Historical and contemporary works of computational art and design will be presented and assigned for analysis. This course is open to students of all majors and is designed for those with little or no experience in programming. In order to conduct work in this course, students will need a laptop computer. This course fulfills one of two core studio requirements for CTC Concentration.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt; Apply during registration period using the form found here: https://goo.gl/forms/oARSYmuhjYrNczVZ2 or go to ctc.risd.edu. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AMBIENT INTERFACES: ACTIVATED OBJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a practical and conceptual exploration into electronic sensors, processors and actuators in the context of interactive art and design. Students will turn everyday objects into "ambient interfaces" or "responsive systems" that respond to the conditions of the human body, data networks, and the environment. Contemporary works of art and design - from kinetic sculpture and sound art to installation, architecture and product design - will be examined through readings and presentations. Open source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with the fundamentals of electronic circuitry. Emphasis is given to the development of creative projects (individual or collaborative), followed by an iterative implementation process (planning, prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining). The course is structured around a series of tutorials and exercises, culminating in a final project. Students also present work-in-progress and prototypes during class reviews to receive qualitative feedback from the class and the instructor. Participants will engage with physical computing conceptually and technically in their studio work and are encouraged to leverage their individual backgrounds to excel in the respective context. Prior experience with electronics and programming is recommended but not required.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO:DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Studio: Drawing is pursued in two directions: as a powerful way to investigate the world, and as an essential activity intrinsic to all artists and designers. As a primary mode of inquiry, drawing is a central means of forming questions and creating knowledge across disciplines. Through wide-ranging drawing approaches, students are prompted to work responsively and self-critically to embrace the unpredictable intersection of process, idea and media. To pursue these larger ideas, the studio becomes a laboratory of varied and challenging activities. Instructors introduce drawing as a dynamic two-dimensional record of sensory search, conceptual thought, or physical action. Students investigate materiality, imagined situations, idea generation, and the translation of the observable world. Formal and intellectual risks are encouraged during a sustained engagement with the possibilities of material, mark-making, perception, abstraction, performance, space and time. As students trust the drawing process, they become more informed about its uncharted potentials, and accept struggle as necessary and positive; they gain confidence in their own sensibilities.</COURSEDESC>

Students explore the organization of visual and other sensory elements in order to understand perceptual attributes and the production of meaning. Using various methods of expression, students may create objects, spaces, and experiences that demonstrate their analysis of composition, color, narrative, motion, systems, and cultural signification.  Assignments allow for inquiries into scientific, social, cultural, historical, philosophical, technological, and political topics. Critical and experimental utilization of design principles, which underpin all of the arts, are emphasized. Students are guided through progressive investigations, in which the act of seeing is amplified by the study of physiological and cognitive factors that generate perception. Examined subjects are taken through stages of representation, abstraction, and/or symbolic interpretation to reveal essential communicative properties. </COURSEDESC>

The study of Spatial Dynamics is rooted in the necessity to consider forces and their effects on structure. Force is the consequence of energy. In Spatial Dynamics the energy and resultant forces are studied in actual motion, stability, and materiality. The structures of physical, spatial and temporal phenomena are studied through additive, subtractive, transformative, iterative, and ephemeral processes both analog and digital. Mediums and materials that are commonly explored and utilized have a broad range of characteristics due to their organic and synthetic sources. Most assignments utilize methods such as preliminary sketches and diagrams in research, planning, and experimental processes. Assignments reference the histories and theories of art and design and include areas of inquiry that extend to disciplines such as the sciences, music, dance, film, and theater. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER ANIMATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course demonstrating and exploring the basic techniques of Stop-Motion Puppet Animation, with the intent to provide students with hands-on creative experience in learning the potentials of the medium, and an introduction to filmic language. Studio exercises strengthen individual technical skills in basic armature construction and model making, animating pose-to-pose movement, the basic walk, expressions and gestures, clay animation with lip-sync, set construction and lighting for three-dimensional animation. Basic sound recording, mixing and editing are also covered. Conceptual skills are exercised through exploring intent, storytelling, storyboarding, editorial concepts, character performance, art direction, and basic sound design. This class is based on process and experimentation. It is meant to provide a strong foundation in the basics of stop-motion animation filmmaking, as well as the confidence to experiment further in one's future work. The idea is to enjoy the process by understanding it; control is born of experimentation and experience. &lt;BR&gt; This is a one semester class repeated in the spring. First preference given to FAV majors.

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What constitutes cinematic narrative, distinct from other forms of storytelling? How do we engage film form to tell a story, generate an idea or an emotion?   How can we alter a traditional narrative structure, and, what are the conceptual implications of these transformations? How can we use color to construct the subjective space of a character, or use sound to manipulate the temporal order of the story? Is there an ethics to a camera movement? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this advanced production workshop, we will explore cinematic narrative first by closely studying how a group of classical, experimental, and contemporary filmmakers have engaged narrative through filmic form. We will then formulate our own new cinematic narratives. Cinema is no longer restricted to the theater or the gallery. Moving images surround us online, on our phones and screens, in the streets, and in stores, taxis, and train stations.  We will consider the formal parameters of these new cinematic spaces and their possibilities. Coursework consists of the production of several short narrative films with film viewing, analysis and discussion as counterpoint. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 Deposit: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective  &lt;BR&gt;  Open to junior and senior FAV majors only  &lt;BR&gt;  Open to second-semester sophomore FAV majors and non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANIMATION INTEGRATION/INSTALLATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio investigates the use of animation as an art form integrated into a cross-disciplinary practice using installation, performance and interactivity. This is different from traditional animation filmmaking in that students are instead exploring variations of the constructed cinematic object and the engagement of the human body as an active participant in the cinematic schema. The student uses the tenets of animation to consider the (de/re)construction of sequential image, identities of transmission and reception, the context of the projected image and light, the monitor as receptacle, motorized optical machines, environment and location. The course includes lectures, demonstrations, project workshops and studio practice. Emphasis is placed upon the conceptual, material, practical and creative approaches to reconsidering and re-making what animation is and can be. The course culminates with final projects. Prior animation experience is not necessary.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of Instructor Required. Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.

The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $25.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required.  &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as LAEL-4599; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPREHENSIVE SUSTAINABILITY THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This research elective class will focus on the myriad opportunities for the sustainable practice of design. The somewhat humbling point of departure is the fact that many, if not all, of the problems we currently face are the direct result of previous "design solutions". There are numerous topics to cover under each of the following domains. Our aim is to expose students to meaningful comprehensive and anticipatory sustainability thinking. The focus of the class will be on the development of a comprehensive, operationally useful "sustainability lens" through which to evaluate design decisions as they are being made in hopes of avoiding the Law of Unintended Consequences on the front end, rather than seeking to simply design without regard for the potentially negative outcomes that require fixing on the back end.    &lt;BR&gt; Material: The 1st and 2nd Laws of Thermodynamics, Material choice, material sourcing, life cycle analysis, the containment of entropy   &lt;BR&gt; Economic: Full Spectrum Accounting. Bring all externalities back onto the balance sheet   &lt;BR&gt; Life: Creating conditions conducive to life, Biomimetics: Learning from Nature not just about Nature. The preservation of biodiversity   &lt;BR&gt; Social: How does your object contribute to the quality of life for maker and user and other organisms, as well? Appropriate human behavior in the biosphere   &lt;BR&gt; Spiritual: An exploration of how students' work contributes to the "Great Work", embracing uncertainty and cultivating wonder  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIGHTING DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt; Elective for majors and non-majors &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.

   <COURSETITLE>FURNITURE DESIGN SENIOR SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we examine individual studio practices in depth through collecting, drawing, and writing. We approach writing as a mutable medium, one that can be built up, torn apart, cobbled together, patch-worked, polished, shined, exploded, and altogether constructed in a way that is not dissimilar to the way an object emerges in the studio. We examine the ways that writing as a part of making can spark ideas for visual work, enrich subliminal visual narratives, connect ideas that may seem disparate, collect a wide variety of sources in a small space, act as a place for reflection, and ultimately be an active and integral part of making. In the process, we will unearth themes that permeate students' artistic work in a way that forges future paths for creative exploration while protecting some of the mysteries that are particular to an embodied practice. Students will begin to develop a personal vocabulary that parallels the richly developed language of their visual work, laying the foundation for their Senior Degree Project. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The primary aim of this class is for students to develop a better understanding of their own practice and its context through writing and archiving influences and inspirations, laying the conceptual foundation and establishing a specific theme for the spring semester Senior Degree Project Report. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Furniture Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Furniture Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; junior BFA.GLASS students &lt;BR&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of Department Head or Instructor required.

   <COURSEDESC>This is a semester long research study group focused on Alchemy and Glass. As a discipline and a material, Glass is inherently connected to Alchemy.  Their combined histories have shaped our understanding of the relationship between material and meaning,  the role of process in art and science and, ultimately, the ways in which making shapes knowledge.  One of the goals of this research group is to explore the conceptual and material potential of Alchemy through Glass.  Our research will combine the examination of practical, theoretical and historical texts along with "hands-on" experiments in Glass Department Shops. The group will meet weekly for discussions, research presentations, lectures and working/lab sessions. As the semester progresses the direction of our research will be determined by the materials brought forth by the group.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to graduate students only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as GRAD-7016 and IDISC-7016; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; junior BFA.GLASS students &lt;BR&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN OPTICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses. Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MATERIALITY - WHAT THE WORLD IS MADE OF AND WHAT WE MAKE OF IT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;i&gt;It is . a political decision to focus on the materials of art; it means to consider the processes of making and their associated power relations, to consider the workers - whether they are in factories, studios or public spaces. and their tools of production.&lt;i&gt; - Petra  Lange Berndt, How to be Complicit with Materials  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is an interdisciplinary course about materiality. it is taught as both a seminar and a studio. We will explore the many materials we use as artists and consumers -- how they are formed, extracted, developed, circulated, and used, and how we think about them. We will look at the physical world through three lenses: science/production, theory, and art practice. These three approaches will run concurrently through the semester so that students will be simultaneously investigating, reading, and making work.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 1. Science/production: We will look at material science, learning about the chemical elements, and then about the most common materials that artists and designers use, from glass to concrete, metals to plastics, among many others. We will delve deep into the economic, environmental, and social impact of their use. We will study fabrication techniques. We will explore excess, waste, and recycling, visiting a waste facility.  &lt;br&gt; 2. Theory: There will be readings from a wide range of disciplines: theory, science, economics, and literature, as these disciplines touch on the study of materials in relation to art practice.  &lt;br&gt; 3. Practice: We will have two ongoing projects. One foregrounds materiality; the second foregrounds process and production. For the first work, you will make a work that is primarily about its own materials. For the second project, you will create a work of art that holds the history of its own making. We will look at precedents for both approaches in art of the 20th and 21st century.  &lt;br&gt; There will be readings,films and videos, guest speakers,  presentations by participants, course resources, and trips.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS' WRITINGS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will explore the various ways artists from the post-World War II onward have written about their work. By examining statements, journals, notebooks, interviews, diaries, poems, manifestos, essays, critical texts, and tweets by a variety of artists spanning Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman and Helen Frankenthaler through to Andy Warhol, Donald Judd and Eva Hesse, as well as recent figures such as Jenny Holzer, Kara Walker, Fred Wilson, the Critical Art Ensemble and Julie Mehretu, the differing genres that artists' have used to describe their work will begin to emerge. Specific consideration will be given to the ways in which these literary forms structure the content and meanings of each artists' work. The course is constructed around in-class discussion of assigned texts, film and television interviews of artists, PowerPoint presentations, and visits to each student's studio. This seminar aims to extend the range of texts currently read by students, additionally serving as a springboard for the development of the graduate thesis within many of these literary strategies are pursued.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Lighting and upholstery techniques, as well as outside vendor protocols, may also be employed pursuant to the graduate student's design needs. Graduate students will develop a multi-lateral skill set applicable to their area of study. Thesis concepts are often explored within this class. Students concentrate, in sequence, six weeks of Studio Based Learning of techniques and skills followed by six weeks of dedicated, full scale, designed and executed piece. Located in the Center for Integrated Technologies, CIT Bldg, the Graduate Studies Wood Studio will focus on contemporary and traditional: joinery, shaping, and vacuum lamination construction techniques. In addition, metal (cold working) techniques and manipulation are also covered. Surface treatments and finishing methods for metal and wood will be covered throughout this class. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVESTIGATIONS: BETWIXT &amp; BETWEEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The unknown gap of the 'betwixt and between' is a space of great curiosity and charge.  It is a space that has captured the imagination of many artists, designers and writers throughout time. The main interest in this course is to investigate the nature of this space, how it is experienced, understood and given meaning from multiple viewpoints in art, design and literature, and ways in which it can become a space of significance for our practice as artists and designers.  As background to our own research, we examine features of the betwixt and between as it is evoked in the writings of the pre-Socratic thinkers, the theories of anthropologist Victor Turner, the lectures of composer John Cage, William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin's book titled The Third Mind, and philosopher Gaston Bachelard's view of spatial poetics.  Artists also walk us to that space, as is the case with Eva Hesse's threshold Works on Paper, Anselm Kiefer's preoccupation with ambivalence, and Anish Kapoor's sublime voids.  Most important, we will make and write as a way to see and understand the various forms and ways the betwixt and between presents itself in our own work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GENERATIVE SYSTEMS AND CHANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Every art practice is a series of decisions. What happens when those decisions are executed as a script of code? How does an artist's sense of value shift when a hundred images are as easy to produce as one image? As pressure grows on creatives of all fields to "generate content" we can look to contemporary procedural generation models in video games as well as the history of generative systems in art and design to challenge the limits of quick and unique production models. Students will create new works through workshops on chance and generative systems. We will study contemporary forms of generative systems, such as procedural generation in games, as well as the rich history of generative systems in art and design, to reconfigure their language and goals for in-class workshops that emphasize physical production. Assignments are flexible and previous coding experience is not necessary. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTERSPECIES COLLABORATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, our design and art process will move beyond biomimicry and become a space for Interspecies Collaboration among humans, non-human species, algorithms, and speculative lifeforms. By using artistic and scientific methods, we will investigate how living organisms, systems, processes, and related technologies can inspire, inform, and become modes of aesthetic discourse in this posthuman epoch. By introducing non-human perspectives as an active part of artistic knowledge production, we will explore worlds beyond human perception that occur on macro, micro and quantum scales. We will work towards post-anthropocentric modes of making that move beyond human language. This will involve fascinating mechanisms like quorum sensing and algorithmic code to create cross-species communication and collaboration platforms, propagating plants and hydroponic systems, breeding live insects, cultivating bacteria and fungi, and exploring bioluminescence alongside technologies such as microscopy, 3D printing, and various other digital fabrication techniques. We will rethink fixed human notions of gender and sexuality by learning about sequential hermaphroditism among animals and plants, open up possibilities for transgression of our current condition, whereby new modes of being and existence may be envisioned. We will introduce DNA as an artistic medium and incorporate the revolutionary fields of biotechnology and genetics into the art and design vernacular by learning the basics of DNA extraction, and other laboratory techniques in the context of art/design. Throughout the course, we will survey the contemporary developments in the fields of Art, Design, Science, and Philosophy by investigating Bioart, Biodesign, Posthuman Aesthetics, Object Oriented Ontologies, Speculative Design, Design Fictions &amp; Non-Human Perspectives and develop both conceptual and formal frameworks that will be explored through research and a series of interdisciplinary projects. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICISM IN THE AGE OF AI</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> Criticism in the Age of AI will explore our culture's urgent need for a hybrid, strategic, and dissident criticism of technology, one that can engage with its underlying ideology and aim to concentrate power for a hyper-elite. As artists, designers, engineers, and programmers all prepare to enter technologically-driven fields, how will we remain critical, especially when the design of software and interfaces, AI, machine learning, data aggregation - and most computational architecture - actively obscures, even disappears its own motives? Traditional criticism developed in a strictly humanist rubric can't accurately describe intelligent systems that teach themselves our values, our needs, our emotional and aesthetic preferences. To be critical in the age of AI, we must engage with emerging, poorly understood technologies on their own terms. We will explore a wide range of rhetorical and philosophical tools found within experimental poetry, games and simulation design, sociology, and philosophy. As a class we will collectively develop and foster critical language to describe dominant systems that intervene in our seeing, language, our thinking, and our futures. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of "humanitarian help" across the world. Yet as form-givers, they not only make physical objects, but also shape our understanding of the problem at hand. This power to represent demands that they should not only be technically proficient, but also be able to think about the ethics of intervention. Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions or aesthetic coverings, leaving larger political and ideologic discussions for other disciplines? Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself? This course asks these hard questions and unpacks them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study. This is not a "how-to" course. We will approach ethics as a reflective friction in our work and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use. Course material includes mind-opening historical studies, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How can we turn mistakes into ideas? How can we successfully screw up? This seminar course - FAILED IT! - is dedicated to the art of making mistakes. We will consider and debate these and other questions. We will define individually and as a group what we mean we say something is a failure. We will look at theorists, and writers, and contemporary artists from various arts disciplines who have had the courage to fail and through their mistakes have made something unique. We will consider how what we as artists consider as failings can be early indicators of success. We will explore what it means to reject the safe and the expected in favor of the exciting and the unknown. We will investigate the thinking and processes behind those who have embraced imperfections and rule-breaking, to discover and learn that wrong can be right, bad can be good, and that originality cannot always be planned or predicted. Learning will happen through exercises in-class, readings, journal writing, experimental making, film screenings, group discussions and other activities. The course will use the book 'FAILED IT!' by international artist and curator Erik Kessels as its foundation [used with permission]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' and designers' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course offers the opportunity to discover the creative and career possibilities in the growing interdisciplinary field of public art and public practice.  During the first half of the course, students research and present aspects of each weekly topic, including: pivotal events and artworks that formed the history of public art from the early 20th century to the present; individual artist's work and approaches to sitespecificity; current debates around defining the public, public space, and community; temporary vs. permanent work; controversies in public art; memorials, monuments, and anti-monuments; a case study of design team practice in a public/private development; public art administration models, among other topics.  During the second half, students work both individually and collaboratively on proposals and projects: a proposal for a memorial; proposals for a specific site in Providence; and temporary artworks sited in Providence. This is a collaborative course with Brown University's Program in Public Humanities. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - studio &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course aims to create sufficient awareness of what yields life on earth, and a complementary biocentric view of the world. New ethical and critical challenges are continually presented to human society with the growth of material science and its implications for design; the course introduces sources and research references to assist with our understanding of these challenges. We explore aspects of human knowledge of living systems, providing a research-based approach to such topics as BioDesign; biomimicry in materials, processes, and structures; functional morphology and the cognitive phenomena of Biophilia. The 'affinities and aversions' we as humans have regarding natural living systems are in everything: from the spaces we inhabit to the metaphors we employ in order to understand complexity in general, including issues connected with health, recuperation and resilience. Using the recently extended facilities and resources of the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab, faculty and graduate students together create opportunities to experiment, observe, and learn about the networked aspects of living systems, materials, structures and processes. Theoretical frameworks associated with the biology of living systems, the growth and formation of natural materials including the contemporary revolutions in evolutionary theory are introduced and examples discussed with visiting specialists. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective - studio&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLEGIATE TEACHING PRACTICUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course helps prepare graduate students to be effective educators while fostering a community of shared ideas while teaching at RISD. Designed to support graduate students while they are teaching in RISD's Wintersession, the course is a practicum in which participants discuss practical and theoretical concerns related to collegiate teaching and learning. As a forum, the course provides a space for group reflection on teaching experiences and challenges in addition to developing effective learning and assessment strategies. Through structured feedback from faculty, students evaluate their teaching effectiveness and document their development as teacher- scholars through refining, expanding and updating the teaching portfolio. In an immersive teaching and learning experience, graduate students will have an opportunity to share and apply knowledge of diverse learning styles and methods, and an awareness of how social identities produce systemic hierarchies in the classroom to their own discipline-focused art and design instruction. Each participant is required to be teaching or co-teaching a Wintersession course.    &lt;BR&gt; Each participant is required to be teaching or co-teaching a concurrent Wintersession course.  &lt;Br&gt; Partial requirement for Certificate in Collegiate Teaching in Art + Design Conferred with Teaching Experience.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Graduate elective - seminar  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVESTIGATIONS: BETWIXT &amp; BETWEEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The unknown gap of the 'betwixt and between' is a space of great curiosity and charge.  It is a space that has captured the imagination of many artists, designers and writers throughout time. The main interest in this course is to investigate the nature of this space, how it is experienced, understood and given meaning from multiple viewpoints in art, design and literature, and ways in which it can become a space of significance for our practice as artists and designers.  As background to our own research, we examine features of the betwixt and between as it is evoked in the writings of the pre-Socratic thinkers, the theories of anthropologist Victor Turner, the lectures of composer John Cage, William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin's book titled The Third Mind, and philosopher Gaston Bachelard's view of spatial poetics.  Artists also walk us to that space, as is the case with Eva Hesse's threshold Works on Paper, Anselm Kiefer's preoccupation with ambivalence, and Anish Kapoor's sublime voids.  Most important, we will make and write as a way to see and understand the various forms and ways the betwixt and between presents itself in our own work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIES OF THE IMAGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Images provoke, hail, console, and incriminate us. They disrupt our understanding of time; expose that which governs our lives and deaths; and influence how we negotiate selfhood and otherness. Yet, we pay little attention to the ontology of the image. This course asks: what does it mean to read and respond to images contemporaneously? What are the uses and abuses of images? Are we too passive to all we see, or visually too tired to care? Students will read a variety of texts; debate and discuss in class; benefit from visiting artists; and submit assignments that knit together their analyses of readings with an artist whose work they are investigating in their own studios. These responses will act as potential content for the graduate thesis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective - seminar &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ALCHEMY RESEARCH STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a semester long research study group focused on Alchemy and Glass. As a discipline and a material, Glass is inherently connected to Alchemy.  Their combined histories have shaped our understanding of the relationship between material and meaning,  the role of process in art and science and, ultimately, the ways in which making shapes knowledge.  One of the goals of this research group is to explore the conceptual and material potential of Alchemy through Glass.  Our research will combine the examination of practical, theoretical and historical texts along with "hands-on" experiments in Glass Department Shops. The group will meet weekly for discussions, research presentations, lectures and working/lab sessions. As the semester progresses the direction of our research will be determined by the materials brought forth by the group.      &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to graduate students only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as GLASS-7016 and IDISC-7016; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NEWLY FORMED</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on advanced composition in Graphic Design and Typography using an array of materials, techniques and formats. Form remains an area of study in graphic design that does not need an application, only a surface. Emphasis will be placed on experimental form-making/image-making using generative and iterative approaches. Form need not follow function. Studio assignments are supported by lectures showing contemporary graphic form, from historical to contemporary work, that are effective and evocative. This elective aims to build a collection of work that can be shared with the larger graphic design community. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; &lt;br&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only  &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLOR + SURFACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Color is a phenomenon of light and pigment and is an expressive and symbolic component of art and design. Color exists in myriad forms: as ink on paper, as pixels on computers, paint on canvas, as light on screens, and reflected off surfaces of objects both natural and man-made. Through a series of exercises and assignments, students in this class will explore the power of color-seeing color in action as well as examining and creating color relationships and operations. Students will rotate through two faculty for six weeks each, and in doing so, explore how designers utilize color and how color gets applied to surfaces. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will develop a general understanding of color theory and applied color through observation and articulation. These techniques and skills will serve as a complement to your other required core courses. A blend of lectures, demonstrations, studio exercises, assignments, and critiques, will allow students to observe, articulate, analyze, and practice the use of color.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways.

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 2</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE &amp; IMAGE IN MOTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We stand firmly planted in a visual world, surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors and more-as large as towering billboards and as small as compact cell phones. Such images provide us with clues about our environment, feeding our mind with information that we find useful for survival or for orientation purposes. But these very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us from discerning what is truly important. How do we tell them apart? The primary goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to create meaningful and intelligent images. Course content is tailored for three levels of experience - introductory, intermediate and advanced. Some of the class projects include documentary photography, film title design and music video. The works of Saul Bass, Bill Viola and Michel Gondry will be used as the "textbooks" for this course. Readings, film screenings and listening exercises accompany studio work. Some knowledge of Adobe Flash or After Effects or Final Cut Pro would be helpful but is not required.

   <COURSEDESC>Students are expected to develop personal working methods and interests through more general questions posed by the faculty. Longer-term projects will be intermixed with shorter projects posed by visiting critics. Students should complete the Design Studio track with a developed sense of self, and able to start framing questions and lines of inquiries of their own. End forms will be more emphasized than in Design Studio 1 and 2, in part as evidence that craft and working methods are sufficiently evolved. The twice-a-week format is intended for juniors or advanced designers who have completed the first two semesters of Design Studio or an equivalent "design principles" track. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course is based on the premise that the narrative shaping of information is fundamental to human communication. As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING INFORMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE VISITING DESIGNERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This graduate-only Visiting Designers course provides contact with the visiting designers in four intensive workshops over the 12-week semester. The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-majors pending seat availability. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN FOR PUBLISHING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will cover all aspects of designing comprehensive art and photographic books. We will examine the use of type in layouts, editing images, grids, scale, and pacing. Particular attention will be paid to certain elements of design production, including the visual, tactile, and aesthetic qualities of paper, printing, binding, color separation, and advanced techniques in reproduction, namely duotone and three-tone in black and white photography. In the first part of the semester students will design the layout and the corresponding dust jacket for a photographic book. The material will include a number of original black and white photographs from one of the very well known French photographers. In the second part of the semester, students will be given the choice between designing a book based on their own interests and completing a book design project using assigned material. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE TYPOGRAPHY STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The second semester continues the development of typographic practice by exploring the conditions in which type operates: the systems needed to work with varying scales and narrative structures. Students will design large-scale and small-scale work simultaneously; understanding the trade-offs of various formats and contexts. The course also extends basic typesetting into more extended reading experiences. Students will learn to set the conditions for readability by creating order, expressing emotion and making meaning. Students will design and bind a book while understanding how the traditions of the codex relate to onscreen reading. Within the durable form of the book, lies centuries of conventions like indexical systems, footnotes, page matter and more. Students also will become better readers, by engaging with contemporary issues in the field of typography and type design.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement for first-year graduate students in the three-year program; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIENTIAL DESIGN (XD)</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As technologies advance, the integration of the physical and digital becomes more common. Screens are integrated into space, objects gain intelligence, places respond to us, and Experiential Design (XD) offers a design approach to the development of new ways to use these opportunities as platforms and tools. XD is the practice of creating interactive spaces which orient, inform, educate, or delight an audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course is designed for participants schooled in graphic design and attentive to contemporary technologies. Building upon that knowledge, this course will prime students to design and orchestrate spatially located interventions. Workshopping will provide hands on experience in rapid prototyping; resulting skills will then be applied in independent projects. Project prompts will allow for a range of subject matter. Scale of projects will range from hand-held to inhabitable, favoring human scale. Project content will range from complete narratives to crowd authored content. Project completion will range from prototypes to proposals, from full scale segment install to final installations. Course content will include exposure to a range of technologies while assignments will be medium agnostic. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $240.00 &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GENERATIVE DESIGN: TOOL, SYSTEM, NETWORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores generative processes with emphasis on visual systems by rethinking the tools and software used to produce and distribute graphic design.  Design approaches for mobile products, generative visual identities, and variable fonts show how designer's role has become more about creating iterations based on modules, algorithms, and datasets. As these components are built for reuse, it is easy to create iterations without much design intent. In this class, we will investigate how designers can take this environment as a creative condition and explore various form-making methodologies to evoke its meaning and context.  Knowledge in basic html/css/javascript is useful. Specific techniques on prototyping tools including Processing, p5.js, and other web programming languages will be provided throughout the course to strengthen students' skills. Weekly student-led presentations and reading discussions will cover relevant topics. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of the department. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL ISSUES STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this combined seminar/studio course we will take a survey of some of the most urgent critical conversations in the field of graphic design today, and engage those conversations through visual work. Through a diet of readings and discussions, we'll unpack the critical lenses that shape graphic design discourse, explore current conversations about design's relationship to structures of power, and look at the various strategies designers and thinkers have proposed for interrogating these structures. We'll engage all this through a series of brief studio projects that interpret, question, and extend ideas from the readings, and through self-directed research work. Taken together, our activities in this course will model a design practice that engages its context in sophisticated and rigorous ways. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; undergraduate Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Digital user experiences are a part of our everyday lives, shaping our realities and taking us to new levels of productivity and connectedness.     In this hands-on studio, students will explore how designers create digital services and products that are easy to use and solve real-world problems. In two initial projects, one independent and one group-based, students will develop interaction design skills such as research, concept development, interface sketching, interactive prototyping, and user testing. For the third and final project, students will choose to work independently or in groups to develop a digital service or product of their choosing. This project will culminate in the final presentation of a "looks-like" interactive prototype and a video that illustrates the intended user experience. By the end of the course, students will have the skills needed to bring web, mobile, and ubiquitous digital user experiences from concept to reality. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MACHINE LEARNING AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We're a fifth of our way through the 21st century, and today's general purpose technologies are evident. Machine learning systems have become invisible norms prototyping algorithmic experiences for us (Facebook Newsfeed), redirecting our behaviors towards corporate interests (Alexa), and reimagining our bodies and minds inside a field of limitless automation (Amazon Marketplace). As we're being conditioned by these systems, designers urgently need to develop literacies and the tools to prototype, redirect, and reimagine back. The goal of this course is to empower you to build these literacies and envision these tools. One part speculative design lab and one part critical research group, this course will convene multiple viewpoints on the machine learning infrastructure shaping our generations' lived experiences. Our studio projects will involve mapping, prototyping with, speculating against, exploring, exploiting, and extrapolating forward from machine learning systems. Student-led discussions, some reading, and short lectures will support our studio work, helping us analyze existing and deployed systems, demystifying how they operate and situating them in their emerging historical contexts. This is a research course that operates from first principles. No technical experience with programming or machine learning is required, nor will projects assume a technical skill set: those new to programming and machine learning are encouraged to enroll. Students are expected to bring a desire to dissect and reimagine complex systems. &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors with permission of the Department. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The poster has been an archetypal graphic design format since the late 19th century when lithographic printing technology came of age and captured the imagination of artists, bringing their vision into Paris streets. This course will invite you to explore future possibilities and contexts for the poster-as paper and as screen-building on its singular capacity to transform ideas into iconic picture planes; and examining the dynamics of typography and image, both still and in motion. Prompts will progress from individual posters, to sequences, to site-specific installations that explore the potential for interactive discourse in public space.

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN IN THE POSTHUMAN AGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The current understanding of what constitutes design is straining at the margins of convention. The reach of design has moved beyond the materiality of objects, to biotechnological matter of chemicals and encoded genetic information, from physical space to code and data. Human beings now live lives that are immersed in design. The designer and their subject share a dialectical relationship, constantly shaping and reshaping each other. The role of the designer, thriving in the world of post-industrial and digital technologies, is thus broader today than ever before-from designing brands and creating personalities, to contriving and manipulating living organisms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Post-postmodernism, pseudo-modernism, supermodernism, digimodernism, are only a few of the many terms trying to describe our current state. Today, we occupy the digital domain as thoroughly as we do physical space. Codes and algorithms have also become signifiers of a new biotechnological paradigm shift, marking the passage into a posthuman epoch by launching us into a virtual space composed of a bright galaxy of screens and digital worlds, creating a symbiotic relationship between our technology and biological selves. As designers, we shape, clash, align, and distort this new space, elaborating a stage for the New Man and the New Woman, and perhaps even the Nonhuman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In this class, we will explore our contemporary condition through visual-research based projects around self-design, speculative design and design fiction. We will use graphic design as a medium to ask questions about ethical concerns emerging from advancements in science and technology. We will develop a new design vernacular incorporating ideas from revolutionary recent developments in genetics, biotechnology, and artificial intelligence. We will employ machine vision: microscopy, neuroimaging and NASA archives to create new fictional worlds in concert with the life forms around and inside us. This engagement with the sciences will allow us as graphic designers to acquire some fundamental tools that probe fundamental human nature, and help us navigate the posthuman epoch that lies ahead.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.  &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and above. &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Typography 1 is the first in a three-course sequence that introduces students to the fundamentals of typographic practice, both as a set of technical skills and as an expressive medium. This first semester of typography begins fully zoomed-in -- exploring how and why letterforms are formed. Students will work with various tools and materials to construct letters; with attention paid to meaning, voice and the line between language and abstract form.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The second part of the semester concerns itself with setting type. Typesetting is the score for the reading experience. Typesetting conventions and nomenclature will be taught by zooming out from the letter, to the word, to the paragraph and to the page. Students will become comfortable with typographic color and texture in a finite static composition. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING WITH COLOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course offers students the opportunity to design with color in a variety of media, while researching and studying color in use (in existing works of art, design, film, and architecture). Students are offered several projects to choose from. Each is designed to bring awareness about the role color plays in different areas, through analysis and interpretation of how color works in terms of optics, communication, metaphor, and visual stimuli. Topics considered include observing color in film, color as narrative device, color and light, color in fine art applications, and color in communication design. Students will also explore the similarities and differences of color palettes as used by artists and designers, and through the creation of several design projects, students will develop a sense of confidence and appropriateness when working with color.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications. &lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This graduate studio course will use the term 'Variable' as a core trajectory through the semester, and will focus on methodologies to visualize variable design spaces and explore the potentials of working within single to multi-axis frameworks. Inside these spaces, instances (artifacts) can be interpolated (generated). From analogue letterforms to the responsive web, this elective will consider the poetic and technical potentials related to the process of interpolation; from observing two knowns, and unknown can be defined.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; We will explore 'variability' in the production of type, but also experiment with how these tools can be used (and misused) to animate forms (letters and otherwise) through scripting and use on the web. This hands-on studio will include an introduction to variable type technologies, as well as workshops to assist in using and making these variable 'tools'-- including investigations into scripting with Python and web use. Primarily a studio-centric making environment, the course's critical dialogue will focus on the transformation of language and communication through variable design processes. Students will leave with the tools and methodology to engage with variable design spaces, ability to visualize and leverage the possibilities (complexities) within them. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors. only &lt;BR&gt; Course may be repeated for credit. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This elective is an opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the process of designing a typeface; to consider all the design decisions that are a part of this creative exercise, and to learn the finer points of bzier wrangling, serif and sans, spacing, kerning, and all the other details of execution which turn a roughly-formed idea into a more complete, rigorous and polished type design. This course will provide a fundamental understanding of how typefaces work in addition to accessing a new design tool that can find practical use.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will involve a range of collaborative exercises, inquiries, experiments, lectures, readings, screenings, site visits, and projects, exploring graphic design as an inherently multidimensional and spatial discipline. 3D, not 2D. Graphic design as object, as projection, as display, as gauge, as structure, as installation, as sound, as architecture. Not just the X and Y, but also the Z axis. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The course's subtitle is "Graphic Design in Space," a literal example being Carl Sagan's "Pioneer Plaque," the sum of humankind and space travel etched in pictographic form onto a pair of 9 ~ 6 inch aluminium plaques attached to NASA's Pioneer 10 probe on its 1972 mission to planet Jupiter. We will also investigate more terrestrial, yet equally literal, types of space and how they relate to the human body: pages, screens, rooms, buildings, and cities.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; A wide range of periods, fields, and figures will be surveyed: from the likes of Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, Leonardo da Vinci, and Albrecht Du?rer, to Le Corbusier, Charles and Ray Eames, and Fiona Banner. Ultimately, we'll consider graphic design not only as orthographic (an anthropomorphic system that operates in multiple dimensions), but also as orthography (interpreting and communicating these spaces through signs and symbols). &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.&lt;br&gt; Open to senior and above.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From Letterpress to Inkjet: this workshop will offer the students a unique opportunity to connect the dots. Two technologies more than 500 years apart will inspire the students in finding either harmony or discord. Neither is proven wrong.   Students will be introduced to the Type Shop through the techniques and procedures for setting and printing metal and wood type on the Vandercook proofing presses. Engaging in this historic craft, newly developed skills will be transformed into contemporary results. The students will unite the digital with the analog technology, for example by feeding a letterpress print through the inkjet plotter or to digitize hot metal type. The options are endless. Specifications on paper selection will be discussed and samples of letterpressed books will be shown for inspiration.     Any such targeted integration of science and art goes beyond the sheer structural and aesthetic qualities of given "product." But as regards graphic design "product," it must contain the conscious integration of the human factor, technology, and aesthetics to prove effective. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors with permission by the Department. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the possibilities of design online from a conceptual, historical, and programmatic perspective. The class celebrates the Internet as a space for social exchange and independent expression, while questioning the cultural contradictions embedded in online discourse and the motivations of individuals and entities behind online platforms. Through projects, readings, workshops, and presentations we will explore the relevance of network technologies in the context of contemporary art and design practices. Students will learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with methods for conceptualizing, designing, and developing websites. Outcomes won't necessary be practical, nor pragmatically functional. Instead we will strive for a poetic understanding of design and the Internet as mediums for critical research and action. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO 1</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY III</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Typography III is the culmination of RISD's typography sequence, with an emphasis on typography and contemporary display platforms. Advances in software and hardware have created new opportunities for how language is written, sequenced and accessed. Projects in this semester depend on altered states, where the content, composition, and context all are potentially at play. Students will continue to develop proficiency in designing for static compositions while extending the meaning and voice of that work across multiple platforms. Students will have ample opportunity to further shape their perspective and individual voice in relation to contemporary typography.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is a studio course, so some class time will be used for discussions, most of the time we will be working in class, often on a computer. There is an expectation that students work both individually and in groups and be prepared to speak about their own work and the work of their peers in supportive and respectful ways. A laptop and relevant software are required. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Graphic Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MOTION, SOUND &amp; VISION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of motion graphics, as well as the implementation of video, and sound design. Students will learn a variety of motion graphics software, such as Adobe After Effects and Premier, as well as studio tools like Ableton Live, and/or other audio-visual programs. Students will learn how to capture, manipulate, mix and optimize audio visual material for final production and implementation.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through a series of in-studio and multi-week assignments, students will create animated projects that include motion design real-world assignments, as well as experimental exercises, with the goal of exploring intersections between graphic design, visual composition, narrative, and the realm of rhythm and sound.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Adobe After Effects will be the primary production tool for this class. Through the sequence of assignments, students will become fluent with the software. In a series of short weekly lectures we will review specific histories, and also current practitioners who are using motion graphics and sound to create works in the worlds of design, fine art, and performance.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Rhythm, repetition, systems, and patterns are all commonly used in the creation of audio visual narratives. In this course the following questions will guide our explorations: - - What is the role of graphic designers in the creation of time-based experiences? - - What new modes of communicating "meaning" become available through the process of systematic composition modes? &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors with permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Together we will explore the social constructs of race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, class, and ability through readings, videos, in-class activities, and class discussion. Informed by psychological theory and research, we will examine the impact that these labels have on a person's identity development, societal positioning, and mental and physical health and well-being. By the end of the class, students will be able to explain the advantages and challenges that individuals and societies face as we become more interconnected in a diverse world. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUYING THE AMERICAN DREAM: AMERICAN CONSUMER CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The health of the American economy and, at times, the strength of our spirit as a people are measured by how much we spend on consumer goods.  Both individually and collectively, we are defined not only by what we purchase, but by the act of shopping itself. How did we become a nation of consumers?  Why do we spend?  What drives consumer demand?  Already in the late 19th century, middle-class values were shifting from thrift to indulgence.  At the time, however, we were still a producer nation and remained so for much of the 20th century.  More recently, the decline of manufacturing in the United States and the outsourcing of production in an increasingly globalized context have done little to cool our love affair with consumer goods.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Using an interdisciplinary American Studies approach that explores the intersections of history, material culture, gender and sexuality, race, immigration and ethnicity, and the built environment, this course examines the nature and expansion of mass consumption, the democratization of desire, types of consumer behaviors, the meanings attached to consumer goods and the act of spending, the role of technology and advertising, and the impact of mass consumption upon the built environment.  Neither a singular consumer monoculture nor American exceptionalism is assumed, moreover.  Different groups consume for different reasons and assign different meanings to the goods they purchase.  We will investigate consumption patterns over time among women, African-Americans, immigrants and their descendants, sexual minorities, and youth.  At the same time, studies of consumption within ethnic communities, in particular, suggest the creation of a transnational identity.  As a result, we will also explore globalized consumer products and patterns.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, the course will look at the various kinds of controls to which American consumerism has been subjected.  For example, regulation is a control; so are recession and war.  Regulation controls the supply side, affecting what goods are available, while recession puts restraints on consumer spending.  War achieves both.  No less powerful are the internal restraints arising from movements ranging from organized boycotts to visions of simplicity that embrace a more conscious or environmentally friendly consumption in some instances and, in rarer instances, eschew consumption altogether.  Fortunately for global manufacturers and American retailers alike, the Spartan practices of radical critics like "No Impact Man" have had limited appeal. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the NCSS Core Seminar, students explore key issues in nature-culture-sustainability studies, developing an inter-disciplinary understanding of the need for integrative approaches to issues including mobility and infrastructure, environmental justice and equity, sustainable food and water systems and the very real present and future of climate change. Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and juniors. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We live amid a world of signs without which we could scarcely communicate or find our way through life.  The theory of signs, or semiotics, seeks to understand the nature of signs as vehicles of meaning in our perceptions and messages we send and receive in our spoken, textual, and visual communications.  This course moves from the analysis of signs and communication to a critical examination of the extension of semiotics to the surface and hidden meanings of dreams, handwriting, literary and art works.  At each step, we will endeavor to test the theories "in practice," to carefully evaluate their merits and limitations.  Through this, semiotics will emerge as a humanistic discipline that underwrites our critical and creative understanding of the world as well as funds our creative efforts to make the world anew.  Problem-based, discussion and lecture oriented with quizzes, practice-assignments, and short papers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i &gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>War is endemic to human civilization.  To some it has been an opportunity for glory, to many more a source of horror.  What are some of the ideas and ideals that have precipitated wars? How has the way it has been experienced by both combatants and noncombatants changed over time?  What are the legacies of war?  War and culture have had a defining influence on each other, most evident in art, language, literature, popular culture, design, and constructs of virtue.  This course will examine current wars through the lens of past wars, notably the Spanish-American War and World War One, touching on such topics as nationalism, terrorism, liberation movements, and the cultures that inspired them.  Through required readings, individual research and writing, and classroom discussion, students will examine some of the experiences, impacts and artifacts of war through the cultural manifestations that attend them. There will be a field trip to a local military historic site. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over generations of time.  This course examines how evolution occurs through natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift, beginning with the search for the origin of species (speciation) by artist-naturalists Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates. Their observations of animal diversity (species variation, island geography, and mimicry) provided evidence for common descent within the animal kingdom, and led to the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection.  Studies of the fossil record paleontology yielded more evidence. Eventually, the genetic basis of evolution was explained by Gregor Mendel's discovery of heritable traits, later named genes.  Today, studies of evolution continue on a molecular scale with DNA and RNA (genomics) and proteins (protenomics).  Students will be graded based upon responses to study questions, participation during class discussion, performance on two written exams and a project on scientific visualization.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POLITICS OF LATIN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course presents a broad summary of some of the relevant issues about the political and economic development of Latin America since the colonial times to the present. Latin American countries are rich in natural resources, yet poverty and inequality are endemic. Political instability has been a common denominator in the region. Latin American countries have experienced dictatorships followed by democracy, and in some cases the return to authoritarian governments with coup d'tats and violent revolutions.  Students will learn about the main theories on democracy and development. They will use these theories to better understand why economic inequality and political instability are persistent in Latin America. By the end of this course students will also be able to answer other related questions: why are Latin American democratic institutions weak? What are the factors that explain migration (mostly to the United States)? How has the media contributed to a stereotyped construct of Latin America? Among others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>YOU MUST BE JOKING! THE PHILOSOPHY OF LAUGHTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Explain a joke; kill it?  We'll keep it alive on life support in this short philosophical survey of what's funny.  We will consider a range of theories of laughter and humor, from both analytic and practical perspective.  To evaluate these theories, we will apply them to various types of humor, such as comedies, jokes, and especially in visual illustration such as cartoons, and the like.  The serious business of analysis will share the stage with our engagement with funny business as well as creating our own.  Throughout, we will consider the ethical issues of humor and laughter as they arise in the theories and the practices of humor. Course requires a sense of humor and will involve active participation, even performing humor.  Several papers and a project of either analyzing something comedic or developing your own.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces theoretical concepts that have influenced our understanding of media and modern culture. Our aim will be to interrogate the relationship between representation and modernity, exploring how various media structure perceptions of ourselves and the world around us. Students will read a collection of texts from various critical traditions including semiotics, structuralism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, social theory, feminism, queer studies, post-modernism, critical race studies, and post-colonial theory.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this interdisciplinary seminar we will explore the jurisprudence of art, how the law shapes what we understand as art through studies of case law, art, history, and critical theory. We will examine how the law defines art and the First Amendment through study of issues around speech and censorship; art and intellectual property, including copyright and moral rights; art and the protections given to cultural property. The class will also consider how artists have responded to the constraints placed upon them and their work by the law by examining their challenges to legal norms. We will investigate how law is itself a cultural form and how it conforms to interpretive rules and norms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE NEW ENGLAND LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Richly varied and dynamic, the New England landscape has been remade many times over, beginning with the arrival of European colonists, through successive waves of deforestation and reforestation, industrialization, the development of leisure and tourism, and today's post-industrial economy. This course explores the different elements of New England's cultural landscape as well as the complex social, cultural, economic, political, and natural forces that have shaped that landscape over four centuries. While examining what different places look like and how they have changed over time, we will pay close attention to the various meanings assigned to them by those who possess and inhabit them. We will also ask what different landscapes can tell us about who holds power, and how power is expressed and resisted. We look at the built environment because it is a valuable primary source in the work of cultural historians, but also because "place" is in itself an important player worthy of exploration and understanding in its own right. We shape places, but they also shape us.  By observing and analyzing cities and suburbs, farms and forests, beaches and burial grounds, mansions and mills, townhouses and triple-deckers, colleges and casinos, parks and ports, ski slopes and shipyards, tourist destinations and transit systems, we will attempt to mine the landscape for insights into what makes New England distinctive and what forms our regional identity, keeping in mind the ways in which New England's cultural landscape is also a reflection of the landscape of the United States. Finally, we will consider the ways in which the New England landscape continues to be shaped by new forces, both local and global, as well as an increasingly volatile climate. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COGNITION FOR DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines." (Donald Norman,  The Design of Everyday Things) Design represents the intersection of technology and psychology in that designers must communicate to to the people who will eventually use the objects they design what the object is for and how it should be used. This means starting with a good understanding of how people's minds work-emphasizing information that is important to understanding the structure and use of the object and eliminating the information that is not. In this course we will examine principles of human perception, attention, memory and mental processing that allow designers to tailor their products to the cognitive capabilities of users.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ENVIRONMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY OF CARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Throughout this course we will engage with the Environmental Psychology of Care through several areas described below. Taking advantage of the diverse settings and opportunities of Rhode Island, this course includes field trips (such as a Moroccan Caf, a community designed park and a guerrilla garden), phenomenological experiments (e.g. traveling with a stroller or suitcase through different environments), and guest speakers. Also, we will focus briefly on concepts of power and how they are actualized in issues such as racism, class distinctions and the like; techniques of exclusion, exploitation, deflection and distraction. Through readings, visual examples, and discussions, we will explore and analyze how the built environment enables and disables people, and what caring environments entail. Some of our focus will be on institutional settings, but we will also look carefully at everyday environments- environments designed for diversity and inclusion which allow people with diverse abilities, different cultural backgrounds and possible conflicting needs to feel welcome and participate in society. We will also consider innovative new designs, as well as existing models of neighborhoods, global cities, and cultural traditions. To do this we will investigate different ideological and philosophical approaches with implications of how we relate to the environment, ranging from existential approaches of "being-in-the-world" to concepts of "dwelling" and how these attitudes can be manifested in practice, objects and the built environment. We will read about and visit with groups who embrace different approaches for working together to care for places. These include environmental restoration, community arts and other forms of collective imagining and action. Finally, working in small groups, each class member will be expected to actively apply concepts from the class to a project defined as significant by the entire group.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REVOLTING BODIES: AESTHETICS, REPRESENTATION, AND POPULAR CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our understanding of others and ourselves are formed by visual images and bodily feelings that are social in origin. They make us feel (un)comfortable, sublime, ridiculous, grotesque. In this course we will examine how the materiality of the body grounds the meanings we attach to identity and subjectivity. The course moves between cultural studies, queer theory, disability studies, literary analysis, and film theory asking how representations structure the way we "know" and "see" bodies. Ultimately, we will explore how revolting bodies-bodies that disgust, repulse, signal their difference-can become bodies in revolt-bodies that resist and imagine new possibilities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO GENDER AND WOMEN'S STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will address the dynamics, history, and context of gender-based privilege and intersectional oppression in US culture. We will accomplish this  interdisciplinarily through academic text, video, pop-cultural analysis, and personal experiences. Potential topics include: feminist activism, systems of privilege and oppression, learning gender, the body, family dynamics, work, gender-based violence, sex and intimacy, health and reproductive justice, the law, religion, and more. In a cisheteronormative culture, we acknowledge that while the gender binary is not real, its impact is very real. As such, we will analyze the ways the binary affects us all as we grow from children in adulthood, and the realities of living outside of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NEUROECONOMICS: THE SCIENCE OF DECISION-MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What happens in your brain when you decide to buy a lottery ticket or go on a date with someone? What about when you spend hundreds of dollars on an expensive gadget that you stop using after a few months, or when you decide to say something that you should have known would be embarrassing? Are economic decisions and decisions in general the result of a messy fight between a `rational' part of your brain and an `irrational' one, or is decision-making all the result of one underlying and possibly unconscious mechanism? This course is designed to give a tour of the brain in its capacity as the `organ of economics', exploring the neuroscience of decision-making and its implications for how we think about rationality and the nature of value. It should thus be of interest to anyone curious about how and why we make the decisions we make and how, if possible, to make them better  - so students in this course will be uniquely well-situated to understand why they decided to take it!   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As Agenda Setting Theory states, "[t]he press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think about." (Cohen, 1963). The press plays an important role in any democracy, and in the case of the United States, it also has a special place in public life, one guaranteed in the constitution by the first amendment. However, in recent times the media has contributed to a polarization of political attitudes by framing stories through an ideologically-driven lens. This has become evident in public opinion polls, and at the ballot box. This course will introduce students to the complex process through which politicians use media to get elected, stay in office, and achieve policy goals. Additionally, we will examine the role that the media plays as the fourth estate, by informing the citizenry on the issues that are crucial to government and the sociopolitical process. Through varied in-class exercises and case studies, students will learn to analyze and assess the trustworthiness and veracity of news outlets.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM OPIUM TO ATOMIC BOMB: THE MAKING OF MODERN EAST ASIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>East Asia has the largest population and one of the most vital economies in the world today. While serving as an economic powerhouse, the region also faces persistent social, cultural, and political challenges. Many of those challenges, such as the tension on the Korean peninsula and across the Taiwan strait, could be traced to the earlier history. This course provides an introduction to the histories of East Asia over the last four centuries. It would examine significant events in the region's history, including the encounter with the West, colonialism and imperialism, the rise of nationalism and Communist revolution, decolonization, World War Two, and the impact of the Cold War. We will explore the historical forces behind the changes of East Asian politics, society and cultures. Furthermore, through analyzing the historical complexity of East Asian affairs, we hope to contribute to the fostering of a peaceful, rational, and dynamic mechanism in the region. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This experimental course offers students the opportunity to seriously explore some topic or question in history, philosophy, or one of the social sciences, which has a bearing on their degree project. Students will be guided through the process of formulating a research project, identifying the relevant literature, critically reading that literature, and working out how the HPSS material (content and/or methodology) can deepen and enrich their studio practice. We'll look at some artists and designers who have made these sorts of connections and but spend most of the time in discussion of student work. Coursework will be tailored to the needs of individual participants. To obtain permission to register for the course, send an email to the instructor with the following information: your name, major, year in school (junior, senior, graduate student), and a description of (a) your studio degree project, as you currently conceive of it, and (b) the area, topic, or question in history, philosophy, or the social sciences that you want to explore. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Socrates described philosophy as an intellectual preparation for death.  He recognized that how we react to, think about, and cope with finality tells us a great deal of what we think about the core of our existence.  Philosophers have been divided between a "bald scenario" that death is nothing but the end of our material existence to which we are limited, and the more reassuring view that death is a door to another personal plane of existence.  Death is nothing vs. death is everything.  We will examine these phenomena from philosophical points of view through reflection primarily on philosophical works but will include religious sources and literary works.  While philosophers have primarily focused understandably on the individual confronting death, we will constantly place these questions and their answers within interpersonal and social spheres of consideration.  We will focus on: What is Death? The role of death in the meaning of life; personal survival in various scenarios; ethical issues surrounding suicide, euthanasia, and other voluntary ending of life.  We will look at a few of the social practices surrounding death and examine their meaning and functionality. Intensive reading, writing, and participation in seminar format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO PSYCHOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the study of behavior and mental processes, psychology allows us to better understand how people think, feel and act. This introductory course provides a broad overview of the major content areas within the field of psychology (e.g., physiological, developmental, social and cognitive psychology) and will introduce you to the psychological theories and research used to understand human behavior. We will cover a wide variety of topics, including how people learn, process and store information, why people possess distinct personalities, how social situations and cultural norms affect our behavior, how we grow and develop throughout our lives, etc.  Throughout the course we will critically evaluate the merit of classic psychological theory and research in understanding people's thoughts, feelings and actions in real world situations. This course will provide a broad knowledge base for those interested in taking upper level psychology classes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Proponents of environmental justice affirm that all people have the right to live in a clean environment free from hazardous pollution or contamination, with access to the resources necessary to sustain a healthy livelihood. This class will examine how and why some people are denied this basic right. We will ask what social, political, economic, and racial processes drive environmental injustice. What material and ideological approaches can be used to undo, repair, or prevent environmental injustice? To answer these questions we will explore how social movement advocates and scholars identify, analyze, and engage with environmental inequalities. We will focus on the rise of the Environmental Justice Movement in the U.S. and globally, paying particular attention to: climate justice, Indigenous environmental movements, settler colonialism, the Green New Deal, and local environmental justice issues in Providence, RI.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Beginning with definitions of "nature" and natural systems, drawn from environmental literature and history, we will dig into questions of what we mean by "culture" and "sustainability".   The vitality of the ecologic and social and built environment upon which we all depend will form the core of our investigations. How and where we live matters; in the present Anthropocene, questions of resiliency and adaptation take on ever greater urgency.  We will study contemporary conditions with examples from across the globe, with an eye to understanding how innovation and creative practices in art and design impact future planetary health. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This course lays the foundation for students pursuing the NCSS concentration. The seminar will include lectures and discussions of readings and case studies. Occasional guests will include scientists, designers and others engaged at the forefront of environmental activism and research.  Students may ground their final course project in a topic connected to their own work, relating it to their major or another concentration, in addition to NCSS.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and juniors. &lt;br&gt; Also offered as IDISC-2403; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIOLOGY OF ANIMAL-HUMAN INTERACTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course, taught by zoological medicine veterinarian Dr. Lucy Spelman examines how we interact with animals-both domestic and wild-and how, in turn, these interactions affect us. Each week we focus on a different species, working our way up the taxonomic tree from corals to gorillas. We study the animal's basic biology, including its anatomy, natural history, and ecology. We consider the role it plays in human society, including as companions, as food, and, as sources of medicine and spiritual inspiration. We study how human activity is affecting its health and the ripple effect on our own health. We explore how agriculture, climate change, emerging diseases, habitat loss, hunting, and trade are driving many species to extinction. In the process, we discover that while many human-animal interactions are positive, many more are problematic, and that although we have solutions for most of these negative interactions, we often fail to implement them. Examples include excessive antibiotic use in cows, the continued loss of wetlands threatening frogs, and, the increasing number of coyotes favored by urban landscapes. We explore some of the underlying reasons for this inaction. In their final project, students identify a problematic human-animal interaction and explore solutions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course is designed to encourage you to explore the range of biological complexity in the animal world, the many ways we interact with animals, both domestic and wild, and, the scientific basis of the interconnectedness of health. You will also have the opportunity to explore solutions for problematic human-animal interactions; it is possible to live in balance with animals if we make informed decisions. The material presented will challenge you to learn more about animal classification, zoology, ecology, food animal science, veterinary medicine, public health, and conservation biology. For your final project, you will research a problematic human-animal interaction, explore potential solutions, and create a work of art or design that inspires others to take action</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RACE, EMPIRE AND COLONIALISM IN WORLD WAR I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>By examining the role of European colonies and colonial soldiers in World War I, this course offers a corrective to the standard narrative that the Great War was primarily a conflict between (White) Europeans. In addition to the material resources that the Europeans plundered from the colonies to support the war effort, at least four million colonial subjects from Africa and Asia fought under European rule. This class addresses WWI as a global conflict, thinking about how understandings of "difference" such as race, ethnicity, gender, and religion were constructed through transnational encounters, and how those constructs figured in to ideologies of culture and civilization. Contributing to this discussion will be an examination of the Russian and Ottomon Empires, including the Armenian genocide; the American Infantry Division called the "Black Rattlers" comprised of African American and Puerto Rican soldiers; and the restructuring of the Middle East. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMATIC REPRESENTATION OF THE VIETNAM WAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most people have developed their perspectives on the Vietnam War primarily through the medium of film. We will examine works ranging from Hollywood blockbusters such as "Apocalypse Now" to Southeast Asian perspectives as in "First they Came for my Father" to the most recent contribution: "Da 5 Bloods." We will explore in particular the following questions: What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history as presented by academic historians? How do the racial, gender, ethnic, and class positions of movie creators and consumers shape the product? How do the films portray American, South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese, Vietcong, and indigenous Southeast Asian people? How do these movies serve as cultural artifacts offering insight into political discourses at the time of their production? Assignments include reading, screening, discussion, a film journal, and a final project.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BOTANY IN THE KITCHEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While we eat foods from over 60 different plant families, we rarely stop to consider how any of those plants might be related from an evolutionary standpoint, or why we might eat one species of the family (say the potato), but not another (the deadly nightshade). This course will look at the context in which the plants we eat exist among the hundreds of thousands of plants on this planet. Organized around the human culinary uses of plants, the class will explore the evolutionary relationships between foods, and discover what it is, that links them together.  We will examine the parts of plants humans consume, and in so doing discover how taste and nutritional value found in leaves, seeds, and roots, is linked to nutrition and protection for plants themselves. The seminar will culminate with a botanical feast, created by the class and featuring unique dishes created from taxonomically related groups of plants.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This Wintersession seminar has a focus on making holograms with lasers and on understanding the physics that makes holograms and lasers work. Ideas from familiar phenomena help us see the connections between everyday life and the abstract ideas of physics. This non-mathematical presentation of optics leads us to an appreciation of the logic and beauty behind the behavior of light. Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

The field of cognitive neuroscience aims to link the mind, the brain and behavior by trying to understand the biological nature of human thought and behavior.  In this introductory course we will discuss several topics including: How is the brain built and how well can it rewire itself? How can we measure the living brain? What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RUSSIA: PAST AND PRESENT - FROM PETER THE GREAT TO PUTIN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to introduce students to the history and culture of Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union.  The themes that will be developed in the course include: the historical process of imperial formation, transformation, and collapse; the spatial dimension in Russian imperial history; Islam in Russia; reform, modernization, and "westernization" in the Russian context; migration and human mobility; and political violence and revolution.  The question of Russian "national" identity, both historically and today, will be an over-arching theme of this course.  From a methodological perspective, therefore, the themes and topics addressed in this course are designed to help students contextualize contemporary economic, political, and social developments in the Russian Federation. &lt;BR&gt;      This course is organized around assigned readings and in-class discussions designed to isolate and illuminate the various scholarly and disciplinary elements embedded in RISD's art and design curriculum.  In combination with engaged reading of the assigned textbook for the course and the content provided through "mini-lectures", films, videos, and literary works will serve to extend the imaginary and visual dimensions of the course.  The reading and discussion of historically-based works of literature within the context of Russian history as well as the viewing and discussion of a film on contemporary Russia will, therefore, help elucidate and humanize the various themes developed in the course.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will examine modern Chinese history through the lens of film. We will watch films about and by Chinese, produced in and outside of mainland China. We will examine films both as representations of particular historical moments and as re-enactments of political and cultural transformations that happened in the recent Chinese past. These films will help us critically analyze historical developments and ordinary people's experience in China as well as the assumptions and biases that go into the making of a film about China. Through this process, we will develop a deeper appreciation for China's complexities and the problems the country faces. Our main objectives will be to achieve a greater understanding of the modern history of China and to analyze the relationship between history and historical representation.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: THE SCIENCE OF ATTAINING A BETTER LIFE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the late 1990's and early 2000's research psychologists began the field of positive psychology to combat two trends: 1) a large and growing body of faux scientific self-help literature that was not based on empirical science, and 2) a historical legacy of the field of psychology almost exclusively focusing on the function and operation of negative emotions (fear, anxiety, depression, anger, etc.).  Positive psychology focuses squarely on positive emotions (e.g., happiness, gratitude, love, awe) as well as experiences like forgiveness, resilience, and flow that improve our psychological well-being. With a focus on human strengths and virtues, the difference between that which we think will make us happy compared to what will actually improve happiness, the ways in which we can improve our satisfaction with relationships, and meaningful cognitive and behavioral changes that can have a big impact on one's psychological well-being, this class will review research on how to achieve a more satisfying life.  Although this is not a "self-help" or "self-care" course, by reviewing the scientific literature and assigning exercises for personal practice this course will offer meaningful experiences for self-reflection and insight into how techniques can be applied to one's own daily life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PSYCHOLOGY OF EVIL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evil has long been a topic of study for theologians and philosophers, but has only recently been studied by psychologists. Although evil is an inherently subjective topic, we will attempt to take an objective, scientific approach to understanding why people engage in evil behavior. Thus, we will begin by attempting to suspend the notion that we can divide the world into good and evil, and instead understand the situational and psychological factors that could lead anyone to harm others. Specifically, we will focus on classic psychological studies that show how everyday people can be led to act in deplorable ways by manipulating the situational circumstances. We will also discuss how inter-group processes can lead to conflict and large scale acts of violence like war and genocide. Finally, we will study the nature of the psychopathic personality in order to better understand those individuals who feel no guilt or remorse for harming others (e.g., brutal dictators and serial killers). This is a very interactive class and will require you to contribute in discussion and prepare an in-depth presentation on an area of your own interest related to the psychology of evil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Proponents of environmental justice affirm that all people have the right to live in a clean environment free from hazardous pollution or contamination, with access to the resources necessary to sustain a healthy livelihood. This class will examine how and why some people are denied this basic right. We will ask what social, political, economic, and racial processes drive environmental injustice. What material and ideological approaches can be used to undo, repair, or prevent environmental injustice? To answer these questions we will explore how social movement advocates and scholars identify, analyze, and engage with environmental inequalities. We will focus on the rise of the Environmental Justice Movement in the U.S. and globally, paying particular attention to: climate justice, Indigenous environmental movements, settler colonialism, the Green New Deal, and local environmental justice issues in Providence, RI.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is a social movement? This course examines how individuals and groups engage in collective activity to change social, economic, political, and cultural institutions. Importantly, we will examine countermovements, backlash, and a range of conservative and progressive movements. We will investigate the ways in which social movements develop narrative frames, art, and imagery to build movement resonance. In parallel, we will examine the strategies movement opponents may use to dismiss, appropriate, or re-frame contentious issues. This course will provide an introduction to major academic theories on social movement formation, tactical strategy, and decline, while exploring the ways in which social movement activism shapes and is shaped by culture. This course will draw on concrete examples from the Civil Rights, Environmental, Conservative, and Black Lives Matter Movements.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will explore how ethnic studies pushes us to reimagine what we define as American identity and its culture. We will focus on the ways in which cultural practice creates the social and political space to challenge conventional notions of Americanness, who represents this idea, and how it changes over time. We will also focus on the development of ethnic studies as a discipline to think about how knowledge is formed over time.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DEMOCRATIC EROSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The outcome of the last U.S. presidential election was unexpected by many. Scholars and political analysts see the presidency of Donald Trump as disruptive and unconventional. However, the idea that democratic institutions were corrupted and under threat here and in other parts of the world has been widely shared and commented before Trump. But his election, his first three years in office, plus the election of other right-wing populist leaders have raised concerns about the strength of our democratic institutions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course is not intended as a partisan critique of Donald Trump, or any other politician or political party. Our goal is to treat the threat of democratic erosion as an empirical question, rather than merely a political one. Is American democracy really under threat? What about democracy in the West, or the world, more generally? If democracy is indeed under threat, what can we do about it? And if it's not under threat, why are so many of us so worried that it is? Since U.S. presidents have limited institutional powers, can they accomplish everything they promised? This course aims to help answer these questions.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FRAGILE FACTS: TECHNOLOGY &amp; TYRANNY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>For hundreds of years, advanced civilizations have relied on governments to provide leadership and essential information, with an independent press serving as a check on occasional efforts to suppress or distort information. This system relied on universal agreement that there was a basic verifiable truth, based on evidence and analysis. No matter how much withholding or distortion or denial of facts, ultimately the people would be able to recognize the truth. In the past 100 years efforts arose to redefine what was true, what was real, what was good. Yet even with multiple interpretations of facts, truth remained an attainable goal. 21st century information technology has allowed false and destructive information to find its way into seemingly harmless social media while some governments have simultaneously sought to subvert evidence, dismantle analysis and deny truth.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will learn about the history of information dissemination and control. Each student will select a current issue, event or story and chart its coverage in government statements, establishment press, and social media, paying particular attention to sources and their motivations. The course will involve readings, individual online research, and written assignments, notably a final comprehensive analytical report. Regular active participation in class discussions is absolutely essential.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>JUSTICE IN THE MARVEL CINEMATIC UNIVERSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What constitutes justice and does it apply to great persons?  This course explores various philosophical accounts of justice and how it applies to the great person in society.  In particular, we will explore the following questions: 1) What is justice?; 2) what does it mean to be a great person?; and 3) Is the great person limited by justice, or does it expand his or her responsibility?  We will examine these questions through an analysis of the Marvel cinematic universe through lenses provided by of selections from philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Hobbes.  Through this analysis we will address the distinction between honorable and dishonorable ambition and consider its ethical, political and day-to-day consequences.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROPERTY: INFORMATION, IDEAS, LAND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this seminar, we will explore property, one of the foundational areas of the law. We will look at how property is defined, specifically the idea of it being a bundle of rights, and how that definition applies to information, ideas, and identities. Property suggests ownership and contestation over ownership. We will examine what rules ought to apply to the ownership of information (personal data for example), ideas (copyright springs to mind), and land (property taxes and public school funding for example). We will contemplate alternate models of property to address emerging political, cultural, and social issues. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MANY WAYS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP: SYMBIOSES IN NATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Deception, manipulation, reproduction.  Life, death, or something in-between.  What does it mean when cowbirds move into your neighborhood?  Can plants cause animals to have bizarre sexual practices, for their benefit?  Are most wasp species pest colonies that torment humans, or parasitoids that benefit ecosystems?  This course will focus on the intimate relationships within ecology, morphology and behavior in the evolution and diversification of plants, animals, and other living things.  Symbiosis (pl. symbioses) is when different species "live together".  Sometimes both benefit (mutualism), but often one benefits at a cost to the other (e.g., parasitism).  The focus of this course will be to observe and study examples of the myriad of ecological interactions that involve symbioses.  We will examine the structures and relationships that exist in a variety of ecosystems and learn to understand why things look (or act) the way they do.  The basic biology of many types of organisms will also be covered.  We will consult diverse scientific literature and films, and conduct (solo) forays into nature.  Coursework will combine lecture, discussion and presentation; weekly readings; frequent homework assignments; final synthesis.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART OF COMMUNICATING SCIENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Registration for the co-requisite course, SCI-W912: Art of Communicating Science is processed by the Registrar's Office.  &lt;BR&gt;This 6-credit course fuses studio investigations and science topics in a studio/seminar model that is centered on the Sixth Mass Extinction and how biodiversity is changing because of human.  Coursework invites undergraduate and graduate students to consider complex issues impacting the environment through lectures, readings, videos, visits to local sites (nature sanctuaries, watersheds, and the zoo) while improving their skills in recording observations through drawing. Methods of visualizing information synthesized from a variety of sources will be presented  discussed and experimented with. Students will discover that science communication is more than delivering just the facts: it can be entertaining, surprising, and controversial.   Each week we will focus on one of the major drivers of extinction today: Agriculture, Hunting/Fishing, Habitat Destruction (urbanization, pollution, resource extraction) and Climate Change. Examples will be presented from around the world as well as from New England. Students will spend substantial amounts of time drawing on location-not only to create visual records of experiences but also to sort through what is seen and felt. They will experiment with different ways of working in the field; (re)consider the use of photography; learn to synthesize multi-modal input .and explore mapping and other graphical means of communicating abstract ideas. Each will devise a personal approach to the goals and format of a field-journal. During classroom studios, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it visually. For their final project, students will research a topic in depth relevant to human impacts on biodiversity, and create original artwork designed to communicate the topic to the public.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; The Departments of Illustration (Doyle) and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences (Spelman) teach this course collaboratively. Students must plan and register for ILLUS-3912 or IDISC-3912 and SCI-3912 (HPSS).   &lt;BR&gt; Classes are held Mon-Wed (9am-7pm) at variable windows. Students must be available during those times. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills Illustration Concepts for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY: THE SCIENCE OF ATTAINING A BETTER LIFE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the late 1990's and early 2000's research psychologists began the field of positive psychology to combat two trends: 1) a large and growing body of faux scientific self-help literature that was not based on empirical science, and 2) a historical legacy of the field of psychology almost exclusively focusing on the function and operation of negative emotions (fear, anxiety, depression, anger, etc.).  Positive psychology focuses squarely on positive emotions (e.g., happiness, gratitude, love, awe) as well as experiences like forgiveness, resilience, and flow that improve our psychological well-being. With a focus on human strengths and virtues, the difference between that which we think will make us happy compared to what will actually improve happiness, the ways in which we can improve our satisfaction with relationships, and meaningful cognitive and behavioral changes that can have a big impact on one's psychological well-being, this class will review research on how to achieve a more satisfying life.  Although this is not a "self-help" or "self-care" course, by reviewing the scientific literature and assigning exercises for personal practice this course will offer meaningful experiences for self-reflection and insight into how techniques can be applied to one's own daily life. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if the student desires HPSS credit.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt; This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business.&lt;BR&gt; The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications II is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on completing your thesis. Together, we will spend the spring semester finishing the thesis and thesis book that you proposed at the end of Graduate Thesis Communications I. We continue to think about writing as a design tool and as a communication tool. For this course, we put more emphasis on the communication aspect. Together, we will continue to refine and strengthen the manner by which you explain your thesis to yourself and others. We will think about audience, voice, structure, and form. We will explore different ways of communicating the same idea in different contexts and mediums (visual, oral, written). We will examine how to share our work and with whom. At the end of the course, you will have a complete thesis.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, ID graduate students only Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course introduces students to the theory and practice of physical computing in the context of contemporary design. "Tactical Electronics" fosters experimentation and critical making with embedded and material digital technologies opening up the practice of design to the fields of contemporary art, DIY/craft and technological development. Students gain experience in designing and building electronics systems and objects capable of sensing and interacting with humans, the built environment and data networks. The class explores fundamental practices of interaction design including circuit design, basic to intermediate electronics, and programming for interactivity. Development with microcontrollers (small computers specifically designed to interact with the physical world) will be taught along with sensors capable of measuring motion, distance, biometrics, environmental variables and more. Open-source hardware(Arduino) and software (Processing) will be the main tools to create various prototypes and conduct experiments. The course is structured around a series of workshops and hands on assignments culminating in a final project specific to each student's research interests (robotics, wearables, e-textiles, installations, etc).  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to ID graduate students only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt; This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor- a defining constraint or liberating perspective along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked: Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival. Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity. Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business.&lt;BR&gt; The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM UNIFORM TO MULTIFORM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the construct of the jumpsuit from uniform to multiform across history, art, fashion, politics, and sociological constructs.  With its inception in 1919 as a utilitarian suit used literally for jumping (extreme sports such as skydiving and parachuting), the jumpsuit has taken diverse forms that have led us into new frontiers in both conservative and undefinable realms. The jumpsuit stood as a symbol of women's new roles in WW2, brands the incarcerated, is used in art and social-political movements like BRICK X BRICK, worn in the performative sculptures of Lucy Orta and explores counter-fashion with the Rational Dress Society.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt; This class will take a closer look at the designs that have shaped history and push us to explore its next incarnation into the future world through the use of new materials, fabrication methods, and manipulation of other soft architecture techniques. These include the use of recycled goods, biomaterials, found objects in combination with traditional textiles such as pattern making, sewing, silk screening, embroidery and others. Beginner's sewing and pattern making skills are recommended, but are not essential, as crash skills tutorials will be provided as we move through the class. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; ID majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to seniors and graduate students. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE COMMUNICATION INTRODUCTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Communication Introduction is a studio course about writing and speaking as design tools. We think about writing and speaking in two ways. First as a communication tool and second as a design tool.&lt;BR&gt; On the communication side, we adress the many ways that writing and speaking surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of communication and how to think about what they want and need. We look at examples of great design communication and we develop and practice our own skills for succinctly explaining our ideas.&lt;BR&gt; On the design tool side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We explore techniques such as design fiction, scenario planning, and other narrative methodologies that are used in industrial design and related fields.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

You will gain general understanding of footwear production. From Sketching demo to Spec Specification Sheet Overview to different construction techniques applied. You will acquire a general understanding of footwear construction and terminology. You will learn basic pattern making skills and how to develop your own ideas/styles using the skills acquired. You will acquire skills necessary to work with the tools/machines on hand (knives, sewing machine, lasting pliers etc.) You will develop the skills necessary for constructing basic cemented footwear from start to finish, applying it to different styles. You will learn about materials used in shoemaking, in particular leather, but also alternative materials. For the second half of the semester (final project) you will apply and experiment using techniques/skills learned on a style of your choosing, incorporating your personal skill set to design and build your own unique footwear project (either a pair or two singles).&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to Industrial Design majors only; juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS COMMUNICATIONS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Graduate Thesis Communications I is a studio course run in parallel with our sibling studio course which focuses on design research methods. Together, we will spend the fall semester casting about, planning and prototyping towards some kind of design proposal or product for execution in the spring. We think about writing in two ways. First as a design tool and second as a communication tool. On the tool for design side, we think about the many ways that writing can help clarify and quickly test out ideas. We think about writing as a form of rapid prototyping alongside sketching, model making, etc. We talk about what writing is good at, when other methods might be more useful, and when to combine methods. We use writing to help clarify and crystalize the thesis plan. On the communication side, we think about the many ways that writing surrounds a designed object (as a proposal, as sales copy, as instructions to users, as specs for manufacture, as criticism, etc.). We think about the audiences for those various kinds of writing and how to think about what they want and need. We talk about the thesis as a tool for explaining the design but also as a tool for helping you advance your career goals. At the end of the course, you will have a partially complete draft of your thesis. which will set you up for an excellent spring.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate major requirement; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This workshop teaches the basics of Rhino and introduces students to 3D modeling through an "exploratory process." Recognizing that experts devise many approaches to surface modeling Rhino Workshop: Exploratory Learning for 3D modeling uses four discrete projects each with a specific set of commands and features that will be explored as students fulfill the project's design brief and discover their own operational style. This approach flips the classroom experience - students use tutorials as necessary to identify techniques for basic surface modeling. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By the completion of the workshop, students will be able to use Rhino as a design tool in their own design process - using the software to simulate projects in 3 dimensions or exporting 3D files to 2D for presentation purposes. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENTOMOLOGIC BASED ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio will focus on the physical and social structures of/and inside honeybee hives and native beehives. It is found that noise level data is a crucial factor in indicating the health of the colony. Based on simple sensor readings it's possible to glean whether the colony is alive or dead, queen-less or queen-right, and whether the queen has mated or not.  We will explore new and dynamic hive forms using sound found in bee colonies as our guiding tenet of interest while exploring different material choices such as wood, clay, ropes, mycelium mushroom and other bee-friendly upcycled materials. During this class, students will work independently and also as a group over the weeks to come up with smarter housing designs for bees that can be implemented at a prototype level at the end of the program.  This studio will be conducted entirely online and limited to 12 students. No prior beekeeping experience is required. It is a requirement for the students to come up with sustainable and budget friendly solutions. Students will need to get a copy of Honeybee Democracy by Tom Seeley before class starts. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $300.00 &lt;/br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

What can illustrated type and it's particular characteristics provide as an alternative to established typefaces? How does an illustrator find the right balance between form and function, expression and readability? This course will provide the opportunity to employ drawing, painting, collage, printmaking, photography, digital tools and other media in the creation of unique letterforms. Students will be encouraged to experiment with non-traditional materials -including three-dimensional ones. Beginning with an introduction to basic typographic elements, terminology, and font families, students will move into creating their own unique lettering for projects including posters, book covers, and packaging.  Typography will be the central focus, but students will have leeway as to the degree with which it is integrated with other illustrative imagery. Along with these projects students will create a complete unique typeface over the course of the semester. Relevant issues related to hand drawn text-type for comics, picture books, and graphic novels - including appropriateness, readability and voice, will also be covered.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE CHANGING NARRATIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Changing Narrative will explore the challenges and possibilities of innovative storytelling structure: non-linear, interactive, multimedia. In this class, students will create inventive work at the intersection of physical and digital media, the old and the new. Students will be introduced to classic dramatic structures across cultures-Asian Kishotenketsu, Freytag's pyramid, Shakespearean tragedy-and learn fundamental digital skills via class demonstrations and exercises. Drawing from these patterns and tools, students will then seek to unveil new storytelling possibilities granted by modern technology (computer animation, touch screen interaction, hypermedia) to traditional artforms (illustration, comics, gaming). What happens when a comic's panel starts to move? Where does a story go if the reader is allowed to make decisions? Students will investigate these creative avenues and create playful, hybrid stories.&lt;BR&gt;   Along the course of the semester, assignments will notably include short-form animated illustrations, experiments with gamebooks and cartoon strips, culminating in a final, long-form narrative project.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; This course fulfills EITHER the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement OR the Computer Literacy requirement, not both, for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LARGE WOODCUT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the world's first print technique, woodcut had a profound affect on the development of all printing -especially the Japanese woodblock process which has influenced so many artists. It uses minimal technology, requiring only a sturdy table, a few simple cutting and inking tools, and a wooden spoon to print the block. Despite the simplicity of the medium, resulting prints are as individual as the artist who makes them. An artist is able to make many identical prints of their image, which makes woodcut a great tool for experimenting with your ideas. Whether you enjoy work with a bold graphic quality or a delicate organic line, woodcut is an ideal medium for those that enjoy the physicality of materials. The class will cover the basics of woodcut prints to gain an understanding of the three components of this process: color separation, carving, and printing. Participants will learn about the required materials and tools, how to safely and effectively cut an image into the woodblock, and how to print it. The class will focus on how to organize and print large scale, complex, nuanced multicolored woodcuts. Reduction and multi-block techniques will be shown as a means of developing personal imagery. This one-of-a- kind course gives students a traditional printmaking skill that is environmentally friendly, can be done at home, on any scale.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SILKSCREENED POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since before the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsides" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAGON CONCEPT &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, IN 3-D MIXED MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course begins with the investigation of Dragons, compelling monstrous and mythological creatures found throughout the history of art in various cultures. Students will research historic forms and consider the purposes dragons and other monsters serve in various contexts, in preparation for designing and building their own "dragon".  Multiple theories of aesthetics relating to sculpture will be presented keeping in mind that three-dimensional objects are among the oldest and most expressive forms of representation and can be considered both the most traditional and the most innovative of artistic endeavors. Key artists such as Donatello, Rodin, and Henry Moore will be studied. A premise of the class is that in breaking the constraints of the 2 dimensional canvas, sculpture has mass and volume, and occupies space in a way impossible to achieve in painting or drawing. Consequently, working in three dimensions provides previously unimagined challenges and opportunities, and creates new pathways for learning; Students in this class will therefore be encouraged to take an experimental approach to creating form. The knowledge and experience gained here should help students become better artists in general and in future artistic endeavors not directly related to the specific material presented in the course.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from more, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. Emphasis is placed on Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with show critical writing or discussions. Additionally there are weekly readings, a research project, quizzes and a final exam.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is an art of visual communication. Style is simply the illustrator's vocabulary. Substance is what the illustrator has chosen to express. The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Nothing creates light and translucency like the combination of watercolor and gouache. It's quickness of application and short drying time have made it a go to medium for most children book illustrators as well as editorial and spot illustration image makers. This course will provide the student with the opportunity to explore a variety of watercolor and gouache techniques while investigating how the medium can be used to successfully communicate ideas and evoke a range of feelings. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The practice of making several preliminary compositional and value studies will be emphasized. By learning how to predict where the water and pigment will go in variety of circumstances, the students will learn how to apply the paint with confidence without fussing or losing the light that comes from the paper itself. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The class assignments revolve around a wide range of subject matter to enable students to develop a personal visual vocabulary with the media. Later in the course students will create their own individual projects. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and above; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PERSPECTIVE DRAWING PROJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Creating believable space on a two-dimensional surface takes a thorough understanding of the principles of linear, aerial and tonal perspective. Bold and nuanced application of these principles are vital to making believable space in your drawings.   This course is designed to allow students the opportunity to explore perspective in more depth than is possible in sophomore drawing. The class will begin with a review of basic one- and two-point perspective, then progress to more challenging applications of creating and understanding space.  By the end of the term, students will be able to invent spaces through their handling of perspective rather than relying on drawing space from direct observation. The medium used in the class is graphite. Beginning homework assignments correspond to the material covered in class. The second half of the semester is dedicated to the development of a large tonal drawing.  Students will conceive, research, design, find image references to enhance details and specificity, and finally execute their final large piece.  The drawing is done in class and for homework throughout the last six weeks of the semester.  Students will receive weekly input on their drawing through large and small group crits, and through individual meetings with the instructor. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Virtual Reality Design for Palliative Care is a pilot course designed to allow students to experiment purposefully in the creation of virtual reality environments. We will measure the success of our work against a goal of providing comforting and liberating experiences for hospital patients with limited mobility, psychological or pain-management problems.   The course proceeds from the assumption that the life experiences of the students, reinforced or modified by directed readings, can provide empathetic insight into visual, spatial and narrative elements that will prove positively reinforcing, uplifting and exciting to others, including those who might be facing significant medical challenges.  Through learning about the medium of immersive virtual reality (3D computer graphics viewed through a head mounted display) the course will address the limitations of this medium as well as its exciting possibilities. We will seek to understand the nature of virtual space, points of similarity and difference with everyday experience. Various themes and templates will be the basis of our projects, exploring design metaphors and seeking insight and connection with the imagined experience of our prospective users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration to juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Statement of Intent required; Permission of instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART FOR CHILDREN: BEYOND THE BOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Children have an underestimated capacity to process complex stories, and are often misunderstood as an audience. Their hungry minds depend on imagery to make sense of life and to navigate through their evolving worlds. In this course, students will explore a variety of art forms destined to educate, stimulate and delight children-books, displays, characters, games. Assignments will include works for a variety of industries including publishing, advertising, gift/novelty, and focus on a range of age groups: toddlers to teens. Students will be challenged to create opportunities for discovery that are worthy of this curious and gracious audience. &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGE DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course seeks to apply a design sensibility to the creation of illustrations. The formal characteristics include flatness, strong graphic quality, awareness of figure/ground, scale, color, placement-these all take precedence over naturalistic concerns, rendering and perspective. This is a stylistic approach that lends itself to clear, conceptual communication. The goal of communication is always primary; and assignments will require problem-solving as well as development of clear and refined graphic approach. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine various storytelling techniques used in cinema that are essential in guiding the look and feel of a film. These will include storyboarding, color key creation, and production illustrations. Our goal is to build the essential skills needed to participate in the narrative process of filmmaking. You will work both individually and in groups on a series of assignments to create finished works that build your individual skills, and demonstrate your abilities to work on a story team in a cinematic production. We will examine camera placement and frame-to-frame clarity by creating storyboards for different scenarios.  In addition, to explore the emotional beats of a narrative, you will create lighting and color keys.  In the final weeks, we will create a finished production illustration for a narrative that will be either supplied or created by the student.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Major elective; open to non-majors sophomore and above as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE HUMAN FIGURE IN CONTEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will learn to depict the human figure more effectively within a spatial and compositional context. The classical principles of pictorial design emphasized in the course will enable students to create compelling and visually dynamic work. These principles strengthen visual unity by strategically repeating various formal elements within an image while contrasting those elements in order to provide a sense of balance.   Master works by Diebenkorn, Cassatt, Sorolla, Hopper, Degas, and Vermeer, among others, will be analyzed in order to gain insight from their compositions and use of color. Students will execute several small-- scale master studies to assimilate those lessons more deeply.   Students will also explore the narrative potential of the human figure in context as they develop personal imagery. Sources for such imagery will be chosen by each student and may include observation, imagination, memory, photo reference or any combination thereof. Students may work in any color or monochromatic 2-D medium - drawing, painting, collage, mixed media, or digital - based on individual preference and expressive need.  During each class, students will have the option to work from direct observation of human figures placed in environments. The models will be set in long poses to allow time for compositional and narrative ideas to develop. Students may also use class time to develop their own imagery from non-observational sources. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective. &lt;BR&gt;Open to all students; sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MONKEY-A KUNG FU PUPPET OPERA: VISUALIZATION, PUPPET CREATION + PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will be open to students from across departments/divisions as an interdisciplinary journey, engaging in visualizing and articulating the narrative of Monkey-A Kung Fu Puppet Opera.  Based on a thousand year-old Chinese quest saga and given new life through a multitude of Bunraku style puppets, both life sized and hand held, this interdisciplinary course will bring students with a variety of talents and visions together to translate and envision a performance based narrative through drawing, constructing and performing. In addition to the research, ideation process and narrative exploration/visualization, students will construct the puppets, design their costumes, learn the artistry of movement and performance and engage in a dialogue with the choreographer to explore the movement and action through practice performance and storyboarding.  The students in this course will have to work collaboratively to create the final rendition of the three major puppet characters in designated teams of production.  Artistic collaboration is a central element of performance based art, and will be a center piece for this course.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course will be cross-listed in both Illustration (ILLUS) and Interdisciplinary Studies (IDISC), with consultation and guest visits from Apparel Design and Textiles faculty as well as  external collaborators from White Snake Productions and Puppet Director Tom Lee.  The faculty and student production team, and the Pulitzer prize-winning librettist, Cerise Jacobs, will engage in a regular dialogue with the students as they facilitate the creation of the project. The end result of the work created in the classroom will culminate in a series of performances of the opera on the professional stage in the Fall of 2021. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as IDISC-4102; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING I: COLOR PERCEPTION AND EXPRESSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Magazines, newspapers and other publications rely heavily on pictures to illuminate messages initiated by writers, and unlike any other genre of illustration, the editorial field gives voice to the artist. In this alternately reactive and expressive line of work, the illustrator engages in a powerful partnership with the written word, effectively becoming an author of opinions and ideas. This class will approach several editorial assignments, all of which involve an illustrated response to written text. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is an art of visual communication. Style is simply the illustrator's vocabulary. Substance is what the illustrator has chosen to express. The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT'S YOUR STORY?</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When we choose a story to read, retell, or illustrate, that choice reveals something about ourselves. What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Animals have enjoyed a prominent place in art for as long as humans have been creating it, beginning with the caves in Lascaux. Along the way they have figured prominently in myths fables and allegories, fulfilling symbolic roles in a wealth of picture books, and appeared as frequent players in visual metaphors employed by editorial illustrators. This course will provide opportunities for students to work within a variety of illustration genres, finding their own approach to working with representations of animal life. There will be in-depth exploration of creature anthropomorphism and its uses- from social and political satire to its capabilities in a wide range of storytelling methods. From JJ Granville to Spiegelman's Maus, to children's book greats like Richard Scarry and Arthur Geisert, the human-animal/animal-human is an enduring motif that will continue to be reinvented and expanded upon. Students will have the ability to channel projects and assignments towards formats of their choosing - including painting and other gallery-based practices, children's publishing, artist books, comics and zines. &lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>VISIBLE CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A society's history is written in its stones. From the dystopias of Gotham City or Grand Theft Auto, the hive mind of the Borg and the ecstatic asceticism of the Shakers, to the suburban conformity of Levittown and the Sphinx half buried in sand, every city, every society, is an embodiment of ideas, history, geography, and beliefs. Each built environment has its own logic, both architectural and cultural. With some provocative writings about the phenomenon of the city as inspiration, you will be asked to conceptualize a place and bring it to life visually. The essence of a city - its buildings, pathways, public and private spaces - depends on how you define the character of its people, its government, its history, its geographic siting and even its language.&lt;BR&gt; After defining a back-story in broad strokes, you will begin researching the implications of those choices visually. Working from thumbnails and sketches to finished conceptualization, you will explore compelling physical and conceptual viewpoints, with a variety of possibilities in the use of media and technique. Rather than limiting ourselves to purely pragmatic architecture, the class will be searching for imaginative visualizations, where form becomes poetic metaphor suggestive of narrative.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.   &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Throughout history, the natural environment has been a subject of charm and awe for the artist, from the delicately painted frescoes in ancient Roman homes to the 16th century, when the landscape transcended the role of 'background', and gained momentum as a sublime subject in its own right. This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From the disturbingly exotic pictures of the Underworld by Hieronymus Bosch and the twisted visual puzzles of M.C. Escher, to the mid-20th Century comic characters of Stan Lee and classic 1950's science fiction films, fantasy images provide a rich source of inspiration for the contemporary artist/illustrator. In this course, we will study the art of Surrealist artists such as Magritte and Max Ernst, the unique fruit and vegetable portraits of Archimboldo, investigate the abstract dream imagery of Hilma Af Klint and Carl Jung, and the seminal graphic novels of Sue Coe (Porkopolis) and Art Spiegelman (Maus). We will interpret text and film as we create our own fantasy paintings working with appropriated imagery, collage, and painting mediums such as oil, acrylic, gouache and watercolor. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; open to non-majors junior and above as a non-major elective. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomores pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURING SOUND: MUSIC + ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration, along with painting, printmaking and many other visual art practices, is continually intertwined with music. From illustrators collaborating on videos, packaging and promotion, to creating graphic novel and picture biographies of musicians and musical movements, the tradition of connecting the visual to the acoustic has a rich history. &lt;BR&gt;   Music will always need to be celebrated larger and in a more tactile way than on a screen-we are seeing the enduring inventiveness of the gig poster, and even the 12" LP cover is still alive as a canvas. Projects in this class will explore promotional, interpretive, and investigative approaches as they relate to musicians, lyrics and titles, as well as parallels between music and visual art. Students will have the chance to interpret musical works in a number of ways, including through narrative approaches, using sculpture, animation and GIFs, and other less conventional means.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be exploration of analogous aspects of music and visual art-sound and color, time based works, performative aspects and related ideas (e.g.: the movements of the hand while drawing/painting as analogous to playing an instrument). There will be some focus too, on genres and movements where music and art have close relationships, ie: psychedelia, pop and op art, comics and set design.  Lectures and discussion will also be devoted to learning about artists who create both visual and musical work.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3-D ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While most illustrations are flat, working in three dimensions allows for the engagement of a whole new range of material and conceptual possibilities. Whether using traditional materials or digital technologies, sculpture is enormously nuanced in what it can suggest. In this class we will examine how objects and various sculptural strategies can be used to convey complex concepts and ideas. A survey of contemporary sculpture and 3D illustration will provide plenty of conceptual, process and material exploration. The class is offered in conjunction with RISD CoWorks to promote experimentation, interdisciplinarity, and access to advanced technologies. Projects are structured to introduce you to a variety of materials and methods of working, including paper manipulation, box making, character design, model-making, 3D printing, and lazer-cutting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Additionally students will learn how to light and photograph three-dimensional work for reproduction or portfolio. The class promotes development of personal expression, strong conceptual solutions, excellent craftsmanship and good design. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Done well, respectful, original, and inventive adaptations can deliver fresh interpretations of original sources that are themselves new works of art that stand on their own merits. In this course, students will adapt written works from a variety of source materials into multi-page comics stories - demonstrating how form, narrative arc, cultural context, character, and emotion can be translated faithfully and artfully from one medium to another.  In the process of doing the work, students will master the language of comics, a medium with its own vernacular, using unique combinations of words and pictures to form meaning - and will gain insights into shared principles of story-telling that apply both to prose and to visual narrative.  After deep reading of the texts, to understand structure, story, and meaning, students will interpret and visually amplify the adapted texts, taking the new work from thumbnail, to full sketch, to final art, to self-published mini-comics. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Basic to all visual expression is the ability to articulate what one sees.  Skill and sensitivity in drawing are the essence of such articulation. The object of this course will be to develop the student's skill as a draughtsman, to make the hand a more gifted servant of the eye.  High competence is not a prerequisite for this course; commitment is.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO OIL PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Oil painting is one of the richest, most powerfully expressive mediums that exist.  It offers a vast diversity of approaches and provides the most flexibility of all the painting materials. To take advantage of that variety, certain technical knowledge is essential. This class is geared as a thorough introduction to the newer oil painter. Our early class focus will be on understanding materials through a variety of life study exercises. Focus on color and composition will promote effectively orchestrated images. Our ultimate goal will be to make powerful images that marry appropriate approaches to oil painting with personal vision. The class emphasis will balance the technical mastery of materials with the clarity of effective visual communication. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we examine gender -- not your biologically assigned equipment, but those social constructs that shape and define what is male, what is female and what is that less absolute space between and beyond. Weekly assignments often begin by reviewing the traditional role of women and men in American culture but through a contemporary lens, examining the astoundingly colorful range of gender and sex identities that cannot be limited to simply pink and blue. We'll turn stereotypes inside out, flip popular icons upside down, and rework familiar images from hallowed museums. We'll search for fresh depictions of abstract concepts like conception, contraception, relationships, power, etc. This course offers equal opportunity for XX's, XY's and those outside the binary..&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PLAY AT WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustrators invent all the time: a "concept" is nothing more than invention. This course aims to expand the illustrator's definition of and capacity for invention, both on the page and beyond. The object of invention herein is delight. Students in this course will conceive and develop three distinct projects - the for children, the second for adults, the third at the student's discretion. Each project in development will test its premise: it will expose inspiration to proof. The ultimate criterion for success, whatever form the project has taken, will be, "Is it delightful?". If an invention is both original and delightful it may well have commercial potential; while this is not the object of the course, commercial potential will of course be considered. Classes will ideally be of seminar size. They will consist of speculation, discussion, suggestion and critique: skull sessions. Such dialogue is essential to the generation and development of both premise and project; it will comprise the majority of class time.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Elective requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.   &lt;BR&gt; Techniques with paper pulp, polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (as low-relief and over armatures). Scavenged objects and supplies to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations are another way to create images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished with mixed media, collage and other treatments that unify the whole. Idea and technique come together so these illustrations will be anything but shallow.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the words of Joseph Campbell, "Myth is metaphor." Just as the world's most enduring stories and significant cultural traditions spring from collective human experience and are given compelling shape by imagination, so is art a metaphor for collective consciousness. This class brings together the study of myths, legends and folklore with the visual rhetoric of the illustrator, as we seek a variety of forms of expression and visual narrative in telling great stories from mythology, legend and folklore. Whether in the form of contemporary urban legends or ancient mythic themes shared across cultures and time, we will examine the phenomenon of myth as metaphor for the human experience and art as a vital element in its expression.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING I: COLOR PERCEPTION AND EXPRESSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Registration for the co-requisite course, SCI-W912: Art of Communicating Science is processed by Registrar's Office.  &lt;BR&gt;This 6-credit course fuses studio investigations and science topics in a studio/seminar model that is centered on the Sixth Mass Extinction and how biodiversity is changing because of human.  Coursework invites undergraduate and graduate students to consider complex issues impacting the environment through lectures, readings, videos, visits to local sites (nature sanctuaries, watersheds, and the zoo) while improving their skills in recording observations through drawing. Methods of visualizing information synthesized from a variety of sources will be presented  discussed and experimented with. Students will discover that science communication is more than delivering just the facts: it can be entertaining, surprising, and controversial.   Each week we will focus on one of the major drivers of extinction today: Agriculture, Hunting/Fishing, Habitat Destruction (urbanization, pollution, resource extraction) and Climate Change. Examples will be presented from around the world as well as from New England. Students will spend substantial amounts of time drawing on location-not only to create visual records of experiences but also to sort through what is seen and felt. They will experiment with different ways of working in the field; (re)consider the use of photography; learn to synthesize multi-modal input .and explore mapping and other graphical means of communicating abstract ideas. Each will devise a personal approach to the goals and format of a field-journal. During classroom studios, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it visually. For their final project, students will research a topic in depth relevant to human impacts on biodiversity, and create original artwork designed to communicate the topic to the public.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; The Departments of Illustration (Doyle) and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences (Spelman) teach this course collaboratively.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE II: 1850 to Present</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the major designers working in the period 1850 to the present.  Areas of study will include an examination of design related issues that will be studied in the context of their social, political, technological, and economic circumstances, as they pertain to the design culture of the period. Special emphasis will be given to the history of interior interventions, additions and renovations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt; Other areas of study will include the development of architectural drawing and other presentation media, and the way in which designs often evolved through committees, or ongoing consultations among the patrons, designers, administrators, and scholars. Attention will also be given to design theory, and the doctrines relating to site, orientation, proportion, decorum, and the commercial design market.&lt;BR&gt; A general background in the history of art and design is desirable but is not mandatory. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement: BFA&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit.&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF INTERIOR ARCHITECTURE I: 1400-1850</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine personalities working in Europe and in North America as well as non-western regions in the period 1400 to 2009. Areas of study will include an examination of interior architecture related issues that will be studied in the context of their social, political, technological, and economic circumstances, as they pertain to the design culture of the period. Special emphasis will be given to interior additions and renovations and other interventions. Other areas of study will include the development of architectural drawing, and the way in which designs often evolved through committees, or ongoing consultations among patrons, designers, administrators, and scholars. Attention will also be given to design theory, and the doctrines relating to site, orientation, proportion, decorum, and the commercial design market. A general background in the history of art and design is desirable but not mandatory. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Requirement: BFA &lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Art History credit for INTAR majors. &lt;br&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors pending seat availability and permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Spring seminar focuses on research, writing, and presentation as essential skills for both studio and professional practices. Emphasis is placed on the students' ability to locate, examine, and discuss their work within contemporary and historical contexts. Jewelry, along with objects of our discipline, will be considered through a variety of theoretical frameworks and cross-cultural and historical perspectives. Research, and the language that evidences it, is the foundation of this seminar. Various modes of writing are employed to mine, develop, and articulate ideas, and to further refine this information into artist statements, grant proposals, and presentations. Reflective writing will be practiced throughout the term in order to make sense of past work, clarify current work, and to formulate questions and ideas for work in the future. The term builds towards and culminates with a formal artist presentation. This is an opportunity to carefully consider and craft the language and the photographic representation that supports your work. The goal is to bring all of these things into alignment and to explore the symbiotic and poetic relationships between them.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Senior J+M Degree Project students focus on a clearly defined, individually chosen, subject of inquiry for 12 weeks. Seniors are required to take full responsibility for the evolution and articulation of their creative practice. Two faculty serve as DP advisors, meeting weekly with students, to discuss and facilitate the progress of their work. Although seniors are required to be self-reflective in identifying the individual impulses and motivations in their work, emphasis in review and discussion begins to shift from the voice of the personal to that of the greater collective, context, and role of the audience. The DP culminates in an exhibition at Woods-Gerry Gallery on the RISD campus. Graduation requirements include: CV, professionally documented digital portfolio, artist postcard, and artist/degree project statement.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, J+M majors only.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M Department; course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The fall seminar concentrates on critical reading as an opportunity to locate, examine, and discuss your work within a broader field of inquiry. The additional objectives are to increase critical thinking, hone reading and writing skills, expand vocabulary, and build presentation skills. Woven into all of this is the understanding that research can be a valuable, if not essential, component of making - each informing and enriching the other. The focus of the spring seminar shifts to writing and presentation as an integral part of both studio and professional practice. Each spring brings a new team of guest instructors who introduce various modes of writing as a means to mine, develop and articulate ideas in a concise and authentic manner, and, to further hone that information into artist statements, written theses, and public presentations. Throughout the term writing will be the vehicle in which to move between private and public realms. This journey will begin with 'automatic writings' and culminate with your public artist presentations.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only. &lt;br&gt;Registration by J+M Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRODUCTION RESEARCH STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A multi-faceted studio practice is increasingly necessary in the field of jewelry. Various modes of conceptualizing, designing, making, and marketing are common in contemporary practice. Nurturing these variegated practices allows for greater diversity in conceptual, formal, material, and consumer exploration. The introduction of production thinking as part of a hybrid practice demands new perspectives of process and the role of the user/viewer/consumer. This expanded field of view creates a critical feedback loop, influencing and enhancing overall studio practice.    This course will focus on the research, design, and creation of jewelry meant to be  efficiently produced as multiples. The course supports individualized research for the development and creation of a line of production jewelry influenced by market research, cost analysis, and production processes. Students will collaboratively explore various design methods to develop broad variation within a unifying design concept, and engage in critical discussions about formal design issues, production viability, and market appeal. Various aspects of the making of production work, including strategies for repetitive manual processes and outsourcing (3D printing, mold making, casting, laser cutting) will be researched, shared, discussed, and utilized when appropriate. The course culminates with a market aware, rigorously developed, thoughtfully designed, and well-made line of production jewelry.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective; Open to JM majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The goal is for the student to gain a deeper understanding of the history of jewelry and the context in which the objects are placed. The course is structured around weekly, thematic slide presentations that are supported by visits to RISD Museum collections, local research facilities and fieldtrips. Readings and class discussions examine topics such as placement of value (spiritual, material, social, sentimental) and how these are reflected in the contemporary field. Class projects focus on strengthening research and presentation skills. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Major requirement, J+M majors. &lt;br&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course utilizes general and specific topoi to critically analyze the field of contemporary jewelry. Students will develop the ability to write and speak with precision and complexity regarding their own work and that of others. In the process, we will create a communal topography generated by a network of inquiry to aid in locating ourselves and objects. Students have significant latitude to incorporate individual interests in written assignments. Themes addressed include but are not limited to: cultural identity, material history, marginalization, and exhibition strategies.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is devoted to developing one's abilities to write and speak with precision and complexity, about one's own work and the work of others. We will examine trends and movements in contemporary art through the lens of critical theory. We will investigate what contemporary art can tell us about the relationships between history, images, and visual culture, subsequently developing the skills necessary to write about your work, what it articulates and argues, and the ideas and traditions from which it emerges. Each term will identify and address a new set of themes relevant to course content. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for beginners in Italian and provides an introduction to the basic structures of the language and to Italian culture. Throughout the course, situations that often represent obstacles to newcomers to Italy are presented to assist students in learning how to immerse themselves into a new country and a new culture. Vocabulary and grammar are presented through teaching materials-including listening comprehensions, and the reading of Italian texts-which refer to situations relevant to the students' experience in Italy.  The study of the Italian language is integrated with an overview of contemporary Italian culture through films, music and lectures that deal with cultural topics. Students will be asked to perform role-plays, street assignments and discussions in order to enable them to speak and interact in Italian. Students are expected to participate actively in the class discussions and activities, and to contribute with suggestions, ideas and presentations &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NATIVE AMERICAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Literature is one facet of culture.  The significance of literature can be best understood in terms of the culture for which it springs, and the purpose is clear only when the reader understands and accepts the assumptions on which literature is based" (Paula Gunn Allen-Laguna Sioux poet). This course will explore value systems and aesthetics that are from very diverse Native cultures, focusing on the ways in which indigenousness relates to literature and storytelling. The critical methodologies developed by Native critics such as Gerald Vizenor  (Anishinaabe writer and scholar), and Craig Womack (Muscogee Creek-Cherokee author and professor of Native Studies) will enable us to study Native frameworks and new ways to regard literature/histories. We will explore questions such as can Native American theory/literature transform or challenge non-Native critical theoretical strategies. Our discussions, which may take a variety of directions, will also examine such issues as American Indian identities and communities as well as the impact of colonization on tribal peoples.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FAMILY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of &lt;I&gt;Anna Karenina&lt;/I&gt; reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED POETRY WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Advanced Poetry Workshop is an intensive project-based poetry workshop for students with previous workshop experience and a portfolio of revised work on which to build. The course centers on workshop: peer critique by students with previous practice in poetry writing, and the shared goal of completing a semester-long publication/performance project. Students are expected to have a strong commitment to active participation in contemporary poetry as readers, writers, curators, performers, and audience. Teaching and learning methodologies include close reading of exemplary texts, experimentation with forms, revision, online/print publication, and performance. Texts will include poetry collections published in 2019 and 2020, as selected by students and instructor. The workshop welcomes work in any language and from any tradition of poetry. To the greatest extent possible, the work should speak for itself. But mediation, translation, contextualization also play a vital role.  &lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite: LAS-E411 Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop, or equivalent experience.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED FICTION WRITING WKSHP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The advanced workshop assumes that students have some experience with writing fiction and are ready for an environment that will challenge them to hone, revise, and distill their craft. A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: LAS-E412: Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience. &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above.  &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NATURAL HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar has two primary goals:  &lt;BR&gt; 1. To engage critically with natural history as a literary and visual art form and with its history as a scientific practice.  &lt;BR&gt; 2. To collaborate on projects and experiments that employ digital and analog methods for analyzing, interpreting, archiving, curating, and creating visual and literary works of natural history. Throughout the semester, we will visit local museums, labs, archives, and field sites to facilitate these goals.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Natural history is a crucial genre for understanding the origins of modern environmentalism, the history of science, discourses of race, and the nature of European imperialism. As an artistic and epistemological practice, natural history enjoyed the height of its popularity during the early modern and enlightenment periods, as European explorers, traders, and colonizers endeavored to classify, catalog, explain, and exploit the diverse flora and fauna all over the planet. In the process, they encountered (and often ignored or stole from) the complex folk biology of various indigenous cultures. Especially in the Americas, natural historical knowledge production depended on the collaboration of various cultures within profoundly uneven power dynamics: European explorers and creolized American naturalists, political leaders and ordinary citizens, amateur collectors and professional theorists, men and women, slaveholders and enslaved people, and Euro-colonial traders and indigenous Americans. Furthermore, early naturalists were polymaths --scientists, philosophers, political leaders, artists, writers, collectors, and traders --before the stratification of the modern sciences into disciplines that took place during the nineteenth century. As science became a more professional and specialized endeavor, natural history evolved into various forms of amateur field science, environmental art, and nature writing, an evolution this course will actively examine through reading, conversation, and practice. As such, our course materials will range from classical antiquity to the present and cover a large variety of written forms and artistic mediums.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL ENGLISHES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar attempts to do two things: first, we examine the global careers of the English language and the literatures written in it from their period of ascendance during the height of British colonialism in the late-19th century to their proliferation in the postcolonial present to argue for a concept of multiple "Englishes" in place of one dominant, normative, authentic 'English';second, we explore the hypothesis that the discourse of "Global Englishes" is not just constituted in writing and literature as most scholars have argued but also through everyday performance, and often through spoken forms. So, a discussion of the cultural politics of speaking and listening across different sonic media will supplement the regular study of selected fiction, nonfiction, plays, poetry, films, television, and music. Topics discussed will include variations in the uses of literary English, translations and adaptations, varieties of spoken Englishes, accents and code-switching, multilingualism in literary texts, etc. Historical and theoretical contexts will include colonialism and postcolonialism, economic and cultural globalization, identity politics, exile and migration, literary prizes, circulation and readership, etc. Not surprisingly, most of the authors we will read are from ex-colonies of the British Empire which now have thriving English language literary and cultural traditions of their own, like India and Pakistan, Nigeria and South Africa, Canada and Australia, Ireland and the Caribbean region. Since the United Kingdom's and the United States' Englishes, even though dominant, are still part of 'the global' we will read some representative texts from Scotland or Wales, for instance, as well as "US ethnic literatures." Authors may include Rudyard Kipling, Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain, G V Desani, Salman Rushdie, J M Coetzee, Jean Rhys, Wole Soyinka, Michle Lalonde, Derek Walcott, Brian Friel, Amitav Ghosh, Arundhati Roy, Mohsin Hamid, M. NourbeSe Philip, Irvine Welsh, Caroline Bergvall, and Junot Diaz. Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ECOLOGICAL INVENTION IN EARLY AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How can looking back to early America help us think and act in our present age of ecological crisis? In this course, we will explore the roots of American ideas about nature, environmentalism, and ecology in early American literature, beginning in the pre-colonial era and ending in the late nineteenth century. In the process, we will study the wide-ranging ecological views of indigenous Americans, Euro-colonial unsettlers of North America, enslaved and emancipated African transplants, and the various inhabitants of the United States in its first century as a nation state. In particular, we will examine how the confluence of various cultures influenced ideas about the conservation and exploitation of the natural world to varying degrees. To do so, we will ask how early American environmental writers defined nature and what these definitions included and excluded. To what degree did human dominion over the natural world and its resources extend? Was America a place for farmer-settlers or backwoods hunters and traders? Was its vast wilderness a refuge for religious worship or the devil's territory? Were humans part of nature or distinct from it, and which people counted as fully human? Was slavery considered a natural or unnatural state? Were animals considered reasoning subjects, instinctual objects of scientific study, or merely animate natural resources? Along the way, we will also ask how nature writing developed as its own multimedia genre during the period, as well as how it influenced various other genres of imaginative literature.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEFORE AND AFTER "MAN": OBJECTS, ANIMALS, SEX, AND RACE IN GENRES OF THE POST-HUMAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the human as a temporally specific and, perhaps, obsolescing philosophical concept. Emerging most cogently in the European Enlightenment, humans materialize as the center of their own concerns, i.e. humanism, through a set of binary oppositions that include human/god, human/animal, human/savage, hu(man)/woman, human/machine, subject/object etc. Post-humanism, broadly conceived, seeks to mark, blur, upend, and/or abolish the distinction or relationship between the opposed terms of these binaries. This course begins by attempting to account for how the human/Man came to prominence during the economic, social and geopolitical conditions of the 17th and 18th century in order to understand the threads of thought that contemporary genres of Post-humanisms attempt to unravel: such as animal studies, object oriented ontology, AI studies, and feminist and black studies in the subject of "Man." The course then turns to these various subgenres in order to think through post-humanism's ethical, political, and social stakes in our contemporary moment.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Launched originally as Timely Comics in 1939, Marvel Comics has always reflected, commented on, and shaped the real world. This course will focus on Marvel Comics creation of visually black hero and  superheroes as well as metaphors for blackness during the Black Civil Rights/ Black Power Movements-specifically Luke Cage, Black Panther, and the X-Men, -in order to consider how Marvel mobilized the racial and colonial unrest of the period to imagine and in some cases imaginatively contain trajectories of black political insurgency. Because all three of these figures/comic books have re-emerged over the last several years, after attempting to understand the work as original construction in its original context, we will look at Marvel's contemporary filmic articulations of blackness to consider whether they represent the same or different projects regarding race and colonialism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;But what I write and how I write is done in order to save my own life.

   <COURSETITLE>DARK MATTER: AN INTRODUCTION TO RACE, GENDER, AND SPECULATIVE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Greg Tate has said that "Black people live the estrangement that science fiction writers imagine." This course takes up the nexus of intersections between black history and the radical black imagination that is commonly called Afrofuturism, focusing in particular on figurations of Africa as a space of science fictional possibility from both sides of the Atlantic. If Afrofuturism has been, as Kodwo Eshun has said, "a program for recovering the histories of counter-futures created in a century hostile to Afrodiasporic projection," how do these writers, filmmakers and artists of the African diaspora reshape the very definition of who and/or what qualifies as human? What can these visions tell us about living in a black body in the present? How can Afrofuturism be used to critique racial asymmetries in the present and to imagine as-yet-unrealized, free black futures? From literature to film to music to art we will trace Afrofuturism across the twenty-first century cultural landscape. Using Afrofuturism, critical race studies, and queer theory, we will investigate the ways that science fiction's disruption of race, gender, and sexuality as stable categories offers radical models for our present and possible futures.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course will supplement these readings with selections from Irish cinema, from Neil Jordan and Jim Sheridan to Roddy Doyle, Terry George, Alan Parker, Michael McDonagh and recent documentary work from Ireland, as well as a discussion of the Republican muralist tradition as street drama.

It is also a tenet of this course that skillful public speaking is a fundamental element of a humane society.  Students will deliver five major speeches, including self-written speeches of introduction, ceremonial speeches, informative speeches and persuasive speeches.  The oral interpretation of literature will also be explored.  Each class meeting will require every student's speaking participation in order to develop skills in the areas of voice, diction, managing speech anxiety, research and organization, use of microphones and video, and use of visual aids.  The latter phase of this course will focus on concentration, credibility, and familiarity with argument, debate and parliamentary procedure.  Attendance at each class is vital and mandatory; furthermore, students will be required to "dress up" for their presentations.</COURSEDESC>

The writers, artists, musicians, and bohemians who gave voice to counterculture during these two decades impacted not only literature and art, but also revolutionized social and political ideologies.  Their emphasis on individual freedom, spiritual liberation, and subcultural hipness, called on all Americans to define their "authentic" selves, to seek higher consciousnesses, and to resist the establishment's repressive mandate that we remain passive consumers rather than active creators. With literature as our guide, we'll begin by examining the Beat movement with its emphasis on spontaneity and the search for 'ITO' we'll then look at how Beat aesthetics and ideologies were adopted and politicized during the heyday of the Hippie movement; finally, we'll consider the impact of these earlier generations on later countercultural movements such as the Punks of the 70s and early 80s.  In the course of our reading, we'll consider the impact of cultural contexts and political motivations on the literature: the Cold War; McCarthyism; the rise of mass consumer culture and mass media; the Civil Rights and Anti-War movements; and shifting politics around gender and sexuality.  We'll also investigate how members of those groups already on the margins of dominant socio-political discourse-women, racial, ethnic, and sexual minorities-relate to the notion of counterculture.  Expect readings from Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, Amiri Baraka, James Baldwin, Sylvia Plath, Tom Wolfe, Joseph Heller, Jim Carroll, Aaron Cometbus, and Hunter S. Thompson. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE> TRANSNATIONAL SPY &amp; DETECTIVE FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course, besides revisiting the traditional narrative elements of spy and detective fiction, considers a selection of the increasing number of late twentieth- and twenty-first-century transnational, diasporic, postcolonial, and minority/ethnic authors from around the world who adapt spy and detective fiction conventions for the purpose of social critique. In focusing on issues related to identity, "culture," ethics, human rights, justice, and knowledge construction narrated by these fictions, we will examine carefully, for example, the figure of the spy or detective as outsider to and observer of society as well as, in the works at issue here, frequently an immigrant or cultural or social "other." In the process, we will also engage questions central to reading, interpreting, and comparing fiction in a global context.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VIRGINIA WOOLF &amp; MODERN FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will emerge from this class with a thorough overview of Woolf's life, world, and life's work. The heart of the course will be our study of Virginia Woolf's major novels: Jacob's Room, Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, Orlando, and The Waves. However, our reading list will also include short stories, essays, and selections from her published letters and diaries. In particular, students can expect to become skilled readers of the stream of consciousness style of narration that characterizes Woolf's fiction and to engage with themes that run through much of her writing such as the creative process, modern subjectivity, sexuality, gender, domestic space, and war.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEDIEVAL TO EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/i&gt;), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and&lt;i&gt;The Tempest&lt;/i&gt; ), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like &lt;I&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt; Melancholia&lt;/I&gt; illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of &lt;I&gt;No Country for Old Men&lt;/I&gt; in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's &lt;I&gt;Shalimar the Clown&lt;/I&gt; or Bahman Ghobadi's &lt;I&gt;Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists&lt;/I&gt;, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's &lt;I&gt;The Submission&lt;/I&gt;, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's &lt;I&gt;Flight Behavior&lt;/I&gt;, Krakauer and Penn's &lt;I&gt;Into the Wild&lt;/I&gt;, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary &lt;I&gt;Gasland&lt;/I&gt;, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in &lt;I&gt;Moonrise Kingdom&lt;/I&gt;, and imaginary places in films like &lt;I&gt;After Life&lt;/I&gt; (Kore-eda Hirokazu), &lt;I&gt;Micmacs&lt;/I&gt; (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and &lt;I&gt;Marwencol&lt;/I&gt; (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will discover how struggles of identity and justice interact with representations of the environment in the literatures of Africana, Chicano/a, Asian, and Native American authors.  We will investigate and appraise how these authors portray nature as theme, plot, character, and setting to accomplish the environmental aims of their texts. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomores and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMA AND NEW MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital technologies have shaped contemporary media and culture in profound ways, including how we make, experience, and talk about art, design, commerce, and culture, bodies, identities, and communities, privacy, security, and war, time, space, and geography, and even the politics of meaning and "truth" themselves. In this course, we will look specifically to late 20th and early 21st century cinema -- ostensibly now an "old" medium -- to help us understand (and sometimes productively misunderstand) new media. What is new media and what can cinema specifically tell us about it? What has become of cinema, both culturally and structurally, under the digital? How has cinema historically represented new or emergent media technologies? How have forms of vision and perception that have emerged or intensified alongside new media -- satellites, drones, surveillance, smart phones, etc. -- troubled cinema on formal, stylistic, and epistemological levels? What kinds of new or transformative potential has new media unearthed for future cinemas? Through readings of contemporary media studies scholarship, weekly film screenings, and student presentations, we will take up these and related questions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING POETRY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Beginning Poetry Workshop is an elective course introducing students to the art of poetry writing. The course sequentially addresses major commitments of poetry including form/content, sound, line, voice, image, language(s), tradition/convention, experiment, audience, revision, performance, collection, publication, and distribution. Workshop is the heart of the course, animating the practice, discourse, critique, audience, community, and mentorship vital to poets. Every class will also include close reading, discussion of assigned texts, and writing. We will attend public readings, curate and participate in community readings, and welcome poets to our class, when possible. Work can be developed in a range of styles, traditions, and languages. You will leave this class with a collection of workshopped and revised poems, which you will design, self-publish, and distribute in print and/or digital form.  &lt;BR&gt;The Beginning Poetry Workshop is a prerequisite for the LAS-E421 Advanced Poetry Workshop in the Spring. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A workshop-style course which combines English with a studio project for students with an interest in children's picture books.  Students will learn to develop storytelling skills (imagination, language, plot, character, and voice) and illustration techniques (characterization, setting, page, layout) by studying picture books and completing writing and illustration assignments.  For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Students must plan and register for both LAS-E416 and ILLUS-3612 and will receive 3 studio credits and 3 liberal arts credits.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Kiki (n): A party including good music and good friends, held for the express purpose of calming nerves, reducing anxiety and stress and generally fighting ennui. May involve locked doors, tea and salacious gossip. This course is based on the premise that LGBT history is told through conversations about and descriptions of spaces. We will use novels, stories, poems, films, and theory to investigate how queer spaces are required to serve multiple often contradictory functions-queer bars are for drinking but also seeking healthcare resources; queer neighborhoods provide a much-needed sense of belonging while also fomenting gossip, judgmental cliques, and gentrification. The definition of the word "kiki" implies that these contradictions speak to a culturally acquired experience of anxiety and nervousness. Guiding our exploration of this anxiety will be queer theory and gender studies addressing the tension between sexual acts and identity, the closet, homophobia and transphobia, intersectionality, and queer of color critique. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: WOMEN'S RESISTANCE ACROSS THE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar explores roles women have played in wars for independence and democracy across the Global South.  As the Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo depicts in his iconic film, The Battle of Algiers (1966), some women fought alongside men carrying bombs in the fight for freedom from French imperialism in Algeria. However, more often, women have forged their own paths parallel to men enacting complex forms of resistance through art, mobilizing domesticity, and protest. Using women's participation in Algerian independence in the 1950s as our starting point, we will engage with women who resist the reductive fantasy of the bomb-carrying female freedom fighter throughout world. Figures under our investigative lens will include Assia Djebar who illustrates women playing new roles outside of the home in Algeria; women who led the peacemaking process in Liberia to bring Africa's first female president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, to power; and Lina Ben Mhenni who used social media in Tunisia to show the world injustice taking place under a repressive regime in 2010. Alongside these memoirs, literary texts, historical documents, and films by and about women at war, we will develop a critical vocabulary of women at work reading theorists that include Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Gayatri Spivak, and Judith Butler. Over the course of the semester, we will put these voices in conversation with one another in order to reconstruct alternative histories of resisting oppression in the Global South and beyond.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students in this course will be asked to: rehearse and perform assigned roles; accept assigned duties on graphic, projection and property/costume design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters and original work. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.  </COURSEDESC>

We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

In this course, students become familiar with the vocabulary and narrative forms associated with distinct strains of thought about addiction. The readings consist of fiction, film, and life writing from the early 19th Century to the 21st Century, and consider how models of addiction-moral, medical, and more-both develop chronologically and recur. Authors studied may include Thomas DeQuincey, George Eliot, Edgar Allan Poe, Jean Stafford, James Baldwin, Mary Gaitskill, Suzan-Lori Parks, Danny Boyle, and Augusten Burroughs. Students write a series of short essays as well as a longer final project that combines critical analysis and life writing.</COURSEDESC>

We will trace this development from the historical cinematic 1990s of New Queer Cinema (NQC), an era that encompasses an explosion of "gay film visibility," to an exploration of present day queer cinema and the ways in which queer representations and queer identities are portrayed. We will study the stylistic developments and controversies of queer film, examining major innovations and changes as compared to films from the NQC era. Such questions as what's at stake in films that contest and re-imagine new queer subjectivities will be addressed during the course.</COURSEDESC>

We will consider various narrative genres as well as the range of film narrative forms from Classical Hollywood to Contemporary Independent to Avant-Garde.  To fully understand the practical narrative possibilities of film's technology, we will spend some time in class analyzing and writing adaptations of literature (short stories, poems, performance monologues, novels) for film. Requirements include film screenings; reading from theoretical works, literature, and screenplays; and writing both analytical and practical exercises.  There will be an additional screening time scheduled.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MATERIAL POETICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Like theatre and music, poetry requires presenting the body -- particularly the voice -- to the live audience. Unlike theatre and even music, it is the writer's body that is presented, not that of an actor or performer. This makes for an interesting situation: Poetry is simultaneously a consummately conceptual and material art (and the bridging can be awkward). Poetry is language's own art form but equally, it is concerned with breath, speech, tone, tempo: the discursive sonic range of the human vocal apparatus. This investment in the body transmits to the fascination poets have for technologies of writing: manuscript/print/digital; hand/machine; public/personal. Poetry, though it has a conservative function, is definitively avant-garde and committed to articulating the new -- in terms of subject matter, form, and technology. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course examines poetic traditions that cherish the material properties of poetry, whether relating to the body; to book/laptop/phone (all technologies held close to the body); or to more macro or micro dimensional surfaces or instruments -- in the garden, on the billboard, cut into the land mass, or planted within the body, whether as a biosensor inside a human or in the genome of a bacterium. We will pay special attention to voice; color; text/image and sound/image relationships; the poetry of visual artists and the visual art of poets; audience; and contemporary digital opportunity. Students will engage in creative, critical, and research projects, with particular emphasis on their own languages, cultural contexts, and poetic traditions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Texts and references may include: Lady Su Hui'shuiwen (4th Century CE), William Blake's&lt;I&gt; The Marriage of Heaven and Hell &lt;I&gt; (1793), the poetry and letters of Gerard ManleyHopkins (1844 -1889), Gertrude Stein's&lt;I&gt; Tender Buttons &lt;I&gt; (1914), Kurt Schwitters&lt;I&gt; Ur Sonata &lt;I&gt; (1922-1932), The Four Horsemen (1972 to 1988), Xu Bing's&lt;I&gt; Book from the Sky &lt;I&gt; (1988) and&lt;I&gt; Book from the Ground &lt;I&gt; (2013), Kamau Brathwaite's&lt;I&gt; Trench Town Rock &lt;I&gt; (1994), David Batchelor's&lt;I&gt; Chromophobia &lt;I&gt;(2000), Johanna Drucker's &lt;I&gt;The Century of Artists' Books &lt;I&gt;(2004), Etel Adnan's&lt;I&gt; The Arab Apocalypse &lt;I&gt; (2007), Tim Ingold's&lt;I&gt; Lines &lt;I&gt;(2007), M.

However, our reading list will also include short stories, essays, and selections from her published letters and diaries. In particular, students can expect to become skilled readers of the stream of consciousness style of narration that characterizes Woolf's fiction and to engage with themes that run through much of her writing such as the creative process, modern subjectivity, sexuality, gender, domestic space, and war.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Literature is one facet of culture.  The significance of literature can be best understood in terms of the culture for which it springs, and the purpose is clear only when the reader understands and accepts the assumptions on which literature is based" (Paula Gunn Allen-Laguna Sioux poet). This course will explore value systems and aesthetics that are from very diverse Native cultures, focusing on the ways in which indigenousness relates to literature and storytelling. The critical methodologies developed by Native critics such as Gerald Vizenor  (Anishinaabe writer and scholar), and Craig Womack (Muscogee Creek-Cherokee author and professor of Native Studies) will enable us to study Native frameworks and new ways to regard literature/histories. We will explore questions such as can Native American theory/literature transform or challenge non-Native critical theoretical strategies. Our discussions, which may take a variety of directions, will also examine such issues as American Indian identities and communities as well as the impact of colonization on tribal peoples.</COURSEDESC>

Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our readings will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Australia, India, Indonesia, Ireland, New Zealand, Samoa, and Sri Lanka.  This history of trading empires and settler colonies will be a major focus in this course.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them.  Writers may include Ciaran Carson, Lionel Fogarty, Keri Hulme, R.K. Narayan, Michael Ondaatje, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and Albert Wendt.</COURSEDESC>

In focusing on issues related to identity, "culture," ethics, human rights, justice, and knowledge construction narrated by these fictions, we will examine carefully, for example, the figure of the spy or detective as outsider to and observer of society as well as, in the works at issue here, frequently an immigrant or cultural or social "other." In the process, we will also engage questions central to reading, interpreting, and comparing fiction in a global context.</COURSEDESC>

Unfortunately, these are not new questions.  Fortunately, they have been taken on directly by some modern dramatic innovators, among the first of whom was Bertolt Brecht (Germany, 1898-1956).   Playwright, director, theorist and provocateur, Brecht drew on popular, traditional forms, which he deployed in response to the crises of his times in order to rewrite the theatrical rulebook.  The course will study Brecht's major works along with some of his theoretical writings before looking at the legacy of Brechtian theater among diverse playwrights such as Dario Fo &amp; Franca Rame, David Hare, Caryl Churchill, Alecky Blythe, Tony Kushner, Lynn Nottage, Sarah Kane, Suzan-Lori Parks, Mark Ravenhill, Jeremy O.

   <COURSETITLE>ENVIRONMENTAL COMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will discuss how comics and other forms of literary-visual art illuminate various environmental concepts. Environmental problems are caused not merely by technological expansion or political negligence. They also result from, and persist as, problems of representation. An environmental crisis is a cultural crisis. Beginning from this position, we will consider comics art as a unique medium for telling stories about how humans and other animals relate to their environments, focusing especially on the form's capacity for representing time, space, word, and image in sequence. To further enrich our understanding of the cultural values and concepts that undergird the environmental decisions individuals, communities, and institutions make every day, we will examine how environmental problems intersect with issues of race, class, gender, sexuality, and disability. As astute environmental critics, we will dismantle the experience of reading comics, and the craft of making them, through frequent in-class discussions, creative projects, and a series of analytical assignments in both written and comics form. These assignments will help us come to understand comics art as a medium for both creative and critical invention. Throughout the semester, we will read comics in various formats and genres, including (but not limited to) graphic novels, comic strips, serialized comic books, zines, web comics, illustrated journals, manga, memoir, biography, fiction, and journalism. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In 2016, Colson Whitehead's &lt;I&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/I&gt; won the National Book Award and was selected for Oprah's Book Club-a pair of honors that bespeaks the critical recognition and popular appeal of his work. Since his debut novel, &lt;I&gt;The Intuitionist&lt;/I&gt; (1999), the hallmark of Whitehead's fiction has been the way in which it bridges between "highbrow" and popular culture, from noir to advertising to zombies. In this course we will consider these collisions of literary form and generic fiction, and specifically how Whitehead uses them to confront deep-rooted narratives of progress, race, and enterprise in America. Readings will include several of Whitehead's novels - &lt;I&gt;The Intuitionist, John Henry Days, Apex Hides the Hurt, Zone One, and The Underground Railroad &lt;/I&gt;- and a sampling of his essays, articles, and tweets. Students will produce several short written exercises and one final mixed-media or multi-media project that they develop over the duration of the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE COOKBOOK: THE RHETORIC OF RECIPES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The Cookbook: The Rhetoric of Recipes" is a course designed to look at the form and rhetoric of cookbooks. Cookbooks are their own distinct genre. There are rules that must be followed, though the range of possibilities are multitudinous. A cookbook entirely about bugs? Sure. A cookbook on gelatin desserts? In the 1960s there were dozens. But a cookbook ostensibly is both tantalizing and informative. It aims to make the reader want to eat the dish that it introduces, and it gives clear instruction about how to produce that dish. The course begins by looking medieval recipes, many of them found online at Cooking in the Archive. From there the course moves to looking at the culinary essays of Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La Reynire and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the founders of culinary writing. Then we move to MFK Fisher and James Beard, before looking at Julia Child and Jacques Pepin and the rise of the celebrity chef. In the course students will be asked to deconstruct recipes. What makes a recipe successful? The rhetoric of cookbooks is an art, just as is poetry or memoir writing. Some cookbooks are literature, others are pulp. Over the course of five weeks, students will begin to learn how to create a recipe that both instructs and entices. They will learn how personality enters a cookbook, and how something like Marcus Samuelsson's The Soul of a New Cuisine is ultimately more about the writer than the recipes. By the course's end, each student will produce their own cookbook.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROCKUMENTARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Visions of youthful utopia in Monterey Pop (1968) give way to violence and mayhem in Gimmie Shelter (Rolling Stones, 1970). Martin Scorsese offers an epilogue to an era in The Last Waltz (The Band, 1978). Madonna sells herself in Truth or Dare (1991) and Metallica undergoes group therapy in Some Kind of Monster (2004). Rock documentaries are as much about the social and political state of America as they are about music and musicians. In this course, we will explore the visual language and cultural history of the rockumentary film genre. Topics for discussion will include: documentary and cinema Veriti narrative forms; the troubled notion of documentary "truth"; music as commercial product; fandom and the cult of celebrity; and the rise of MTV. Students should be prepared to participate in class discussion, attend film screenings, complete critical readings, and hone their analytical writing skills.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this writing workshop, we will explore the short story form, working to put into words what we--as individual readers--hope to find in it. We will consider what makes a story a story, while acknowledging that it is often something ineffable, indefinable. We will read from a range of contemporary and classic writers and will also read essays on craft. A significant amount of class time will be devoted to peer workshops. At the end of the term, students will be expected to submit a portfolio comprised of reflections, writing exercises, and completed stories.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LESBIAN NOVEL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>To be a lesbian, according to Monique Wittig, seems the simplest and most complex mode of desiring: "she who was interested in 'only' half of the population and had a violent desire for that half." In a world overcrowded by the voices and bodies of men, how does a lesbian carve out physical and imaginative space to let her desires free? This course will explore how this question has been addressed by daring, renegade lesbian writers who have used the medium of textual narrative to produce both history and future. Rather than reading these novels as historical document, sociological artifact, or even personal testaments, we will digest them as performance, wish-fulfillment, blueprint for a world in which love and sex between women reign. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; LAS-E101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EMILY DICKINSON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Emily Dickinson (1830 -1886) has an undeserved reputation for being a gloomy, inscrutable, death-obsessed recluse. But, when reading her poetry, letters, herbaria, recipes, and random notes, we come to discover a more complex figure: Dickinson was a nimble-minded, inclusive thinker; a poet obsessed with songs, riddles, and linguistic puzzles; a skilled baker; a locally admired gardener; a lover of human, animal, and natural worlds; and a playful, devoted friend. In her poetry, Dickinson could invest the same vast and inimitable creative and intellectual energies into an exploration of the fate of the human soul as she could into an observation of her cat stalking a bird. Formally, stylistically, and conceptually, her poetry defied and continues to defy convention, and it went virtually unpublished during her lifetime. Her poetry is also rare in that its interpretation depends on its visual presentation. During her life, Dickinson collected and annotated her poetry in handwritten booklets (or fascicles). These fascicles open up opportunities to appreciate her work more abstractly as visual-literary art that fundamentally challenges our expectations of what makes a poem a poem. In this course, we will read, discuss, and write about the many versions of Dickinson, as seen through the various scholarly efforts to transcribe, edit, and publish her work, as well as through our own manuscript-transcription projects. We will also explore the material, historical, biographical, and critical contexts for her work, drawing from a diverse body of meticulous, creative, and rebellious Dickinson criticism. Far from a traditional literature class, this course adopts a hands-on approach to understanding Dickinson's life and work, which will include manuscript transcription projects, natural historical excursions, bread and pastry baking efforts, along with various writing assignments and exercises. The course also includes a short trip to Amherst, Massachusetts, where we will visit the Dickinson Homestead and Museum (where Emily lived and composed the vast majority of her letters and poems), spend time in the Dickinson archives at Amherst College, and explore the surrounding town and its natural environment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; LAS-E101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CREATIVE NON-FICTION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Creative Nonfiction can be tricky to define. While not journalism per se, creative nonfiction can incorporate historical facts or texts alongside a narrative of personal experience. Dating back to 16th century essayist Michel De Montaigne, and the arguable invention of the essai as a method of testing ideas, creative nonfiction is often a kind of organized thought experiment through personal experience. Joan Didion, James Baldwin, and Susan Sontag were exemplary figures in the 60s and 70s blending personal reflection with an examination of current events and contemporary issues. Today, such literary figures as Claudia Rankine, Jesmyn Ward, and Maggie Nelson carry on this tradition. At the heart of nonfiction, lies the examining mind that uses a sense of self or often lyrical "I" to investigate a larger world experience. We will be examining how our own personal sense of the daily and the ordinary can be used as a kind of crucible to think about, through, and with current events and other social and political happenings today.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENVIRONMENTAL HUMANITIES RESEARCH SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Practitioners in the Environmental Humanities (EH) engage in disciplinary and cross-disciplinary research in the humanities to think about representation, meaning, value, ethics, and power in relation to environmental questions, issues, and crises.  EH offers a capacious umbrella under which to gather inquiry in anthropology, art and design, critical animal studies, cultural studies, film studies, history, literary studies, philosophy, and visual studies, among other disciplines, methodologies, and modes.  As Emily O'Gorman and her colleagues write in their introduction to "Teaching the Environmental Humanities: International Perspectives and Practices," EH is "grounded in the growing recognition that diverse human understandings about, and activities in, the environment are critical factors in making sense of, and responsibly inhabiting, a dynamic more-than-human-world. [.] Work in EH seeks to develop and support alternative framings, approaches, and solutions that operate outside the dichotomized understandings of society and the environment which have underpinned diverse forms of colonialism, militarism, globalism, extractivism, and erasure.  Living as we are in the midst of these violent global transformations, work in EH seeks to find modes of addressing environmental change that take seriously issues of justice, inequality, and oppression, and that value and support diversities of all kinds."  Students in the Environmental Humanities Research Seminar will engage in guided and independent liberal arts-based research in the environmental humanities in order to contextualize, extend, and/or refine an existing project or to develop a new project.  The project under development could be either a liberal-arts based project or it could be a studio-based project that would be deepened through liberal-arts based research.  The seminar will include reading and discussion that gives all participants a common vocabulary for liberal arts-based research in the environmental humanities, but each student will develop and pursue an individualized research program.  In addition to deep curiosity about one's subject matter, receptivity to the messiness of the research process, and a willingness to support other classmates in their research, this class requires excellent time management skills.  Assignments will include: library-based research, an annotated bibliography, reflective writing, a final paper, and a final presentation.  Students need to obtain instructor permission to enroll in this course. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Email nmerola@risd.edu to apply to enroll. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since it's creation over 100 years ago, landscape architecture has expanded beyond horticultural preoccupations to a discipline that engages natural, political and cultural systems to build ecological and social resilience.  This professional practice seminar explores contemporary practices of landscape architecture through the exploration of six current trends in practice: operating, researching, engaging, constructing, programming, and sustaining.  These topics are explored and discussed through student research initiatives, in-class lectures, readings, case study presentations from a wide range of practitioners, office visits, and site visits.  The goal of the course is to expose students to the variety of ways to practice landscape architecture today.  Students are encouraged to ask questions, bring their own experiences to class, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.  &lt;br&gt; Please see 2014 class blog for student content and writing samples: http://principlesofpractice2014.tumblr.com&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design  Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing. This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INVISIBLE LANDSCAPES &amp; ATMOSPHERIC DEVICES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Space in the environment is defined by a number of hidden climatic factors that we can feel, but cannot touch. These factors, such as light, temperature, wind, humidity, and sound, have spatial qualities that impact not only how space feels, but also how it is shaped. These factors are constantly changing and therefore define dynamic microclimates as they interact with physical elements in the environment. Computer simulations give us an idea of how these microclimates behave, but these visualizations lack the qualities of human experience, and ignore the way space is understood by a body moving through it. This class offers the opportunity for students to develop their own tools for sensing and visualizing microclimatic space in real-time, as it is perceived by the body. In order to develop these tools, students will be given an introduction to theories of sensory phenomena and environmental space, as well as methods of fieldwork and experiential drawing.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This course will also be a practical and conceptual exploration into electronic sensors, processors and actuators. Students will use microcontrollers to design their own atmospheric sensing tools, in order to reveal what are normally hidden qualities of the spatial environment. Open-source hardware (Arduino) and software (Processing) will be taught along with fundamentals of electronic circuitry. After an introduction to fundamentals, students will move through a process of planning, prototyping, and testing their instruments in the field and then refining before their final presentation. Students will present works-in-progress during class critiques to receive qualitative feedback from the class and instructors.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $250.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Also offerd as IDISC-3211; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Rhino will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;br&gt;Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Rhino will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;br&gt;Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH METHODS FOR DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As the scope and objectives of the design disciplines expand and diversify, the ability to implement effective research methodologies has become  increasingly critical to position designers to generate and validate new knowledge. This course will survey research methods relevant to the design disciplines that have emerged from the sciences, the social sciences and the arts with special focus on those utilized by landscape architects.  Methods we will examine include case studies, descriptive strategies, classification schemes, interpretive strategies, evaluation and diagnosis, engaged action research, projective design and arts-based practices. Students will work individually and in teams to analyze and compare different research strategies, understand their procedures and sequences, the types of data required, projected outcomes, and value by examining a set of projects of diverse scales. Visiting lecturers will present  research based design projects. The goal of the course is to provide students with a framework of research methodologies with which they can begin to build their own research based practices.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; LDAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by the Landscape Architecture Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Methods of Visual Translation workshop sequence is a 3 part series that seeks to introduce a range of advanced skill based tools and concepts rooted in landscape architecture to equip you with a foundation for further design work. These include spatial and material exploration, systems thinking, and site readings and response. Through these brief immersions in digital studio culture and practice, the intent is to gain a facility for seeing, thinking, and making critically. This workshop course provides an intensive inquiry into the exploration, enhancement, and extrapolation of digital media and the subsequent modes of conceptual, organizational, and formal expression. Through a series of working labs, students are introduced to various software applications and hybrid driven techniques as a means to learn basic concepts of rigorous construction and extraction. Instead of understanding digital visualization simply as an end product, the methodologies introduced will emphasize design as an iterative process, rooted in thinking through the act of drawing and making. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; LDAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Department, course not available via web-registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

As Landscape Architects, we are often asked to build narratives around a design that are flexible or sometimes tailored to a specific user. To do this, it is important to know what presentation style and drawing will provide the most clarity and capture the most attention. In this workshop students will use landscape architectural case studies of varied scales, locations and contexts as a way to learn how to read, observe, translate, interpret, and communicate design work through orthographic drawing, diagramming, modeling, and visual communication or graphic design. Through this process students will also begin building an internal library of landscape sites for use during their time at RISD and beyond. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; LDAR majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Department, course not available via web-registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

You can't eat well unless you farm well, and you can't farm well unless the goal is providing good food for people." This course will look at the intersection of cultural eating practices and sustainable food production, not only in the United States, but also around the world. How can what we eat impact climate change? How do fair labor practices and social justice figure into sustainable food systems? What abandoned farming practices offer new ways of thinking today? Readings will include works by Wendell Berry, Jessica Harris, Saru Jayaraman, Wangari Maathai, Michael Pollan, Nadia Seremtakis, Pierre Thiam, and others. As a graduate seminar, this class will rely on class discussions and independent research. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to graduate students only.   &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING POST CARBON FUTURES: POLITICAL ECOLOGIES OF HOPE, SOLIDARITY AND POSSIBILITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore and critically interrogate the many ways through which low-carbon futures are currently being envisaged, advocated, promoted or contested. The discussion will be grounded in social /political theory and political ecology but we will range broadly exploring broader discussions in energy studies, architecture and design, cultural and policy studies to film and literature as they pertain to decarbonization. We will attend to key scientific and technical debates on decarbonization and wrestle with ongoing debates in energy studies. But the course will also be alert to the limits of what formal modelling and climate science can tell us about the future. As such the course will pay particular attention to the cultural and political imaginaries that are irreducibly entangled in contemporary scientific, socio-technical and socio-ecological debates and their consequences. In Post Carbon Futures students will debate the merits of green capitalist and post-capitalist, socio-centric and technocentric, Eurocentric and post-Eurocentric visions of the transition away from fossil fuels. We will examine a full range of low-carbon discourses: from technocentric ecomoderisms to eco-socialisms, eco-fatalisms to queer cyborg feminisms, degrowth and eco-militarism to indigenous futuring and environmental justice studies. The course will interrogate Northern discussions of the Green New Deal but also highlight perspectives from more marginalized perspectives from cosmopolitics to indigenous political ecologies. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as HPSS-014G; Register in the course for which credit is desired.  &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite if taken for HPSS credit.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INNOVATION STUDIO: A SYSTEMS PRIMER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Intractable problems demand the effective integration of theory and practice. This three credit design studio brings graduate students from across RISD to take on the challenge of designing for systems change.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The studio is intended to introduce liberal arts Masters students to the synthetic decision-making methods that define creative practices and to introduce studio-based Masters students to the analytic decision-making methods at the core of humanities and social sciences. The studio will work on a system-scale problem (to be determined) that demands the exercise of both synthetic and analytic skills. By the completion of the course, students will gain a deep appreciation of the productive relationship that design and creative thinking can have with advocacy, planning, policy and practice-based approaches. Over the course of the semester students will work together to build a common language and frame a studio-wide approach to the problem. Following this collaborative effort, students will undertake individual design responses at a range of scales and disciplines.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; At RISD and in professional practice, Charlie Cannon, focuses on design as a tool for social and environmental innovation.  With undergraduate training in anthropology and graduate training in Architecture, he is adept at moving with students across different disciplines to craft more comprehensive design approaches to apparently intractable problems.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to graduate students. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required; contact Charlie Cannon at ccannon@risd.edu.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGNING POST CARBON FUTURES: POLITICAL ECOLOGIES OF HOPE, SOLIDARITY AND POSSIBILITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore and critically interrogate the many ways through which low-carbon futures are currently being envisaged, advocated, promoted or contested. The discussion will be grounded in social /political theory and political ecology but we will range broadly exploring broader discussions in energy studies, architecture and design, cultural and policy studies to film and literature as they pertain to decarbonization. We will attend to key scientific and technical debates on decarbonization and wrestle with ongoing debates in energy studies. But the course will also be alert to the limits of what formal modelling and climate science can tell us about the future. As such the course will pay particular attention to the cultural and political imaginaries that are irreducibly entangled in contemporary scientific, socio-technical and socio-ecological debates and their consequences. In Post Carbon Futures students will debate the merits of green capitalist and post-capitalist, socio-centric and technocentric, Eurocentric and post-Eurocentric visions of the transition away from fossil fuels. We will examine a full range of low-carbon discourses: from technocentric ecomoderisms to eco-socialisms, eco-fatalisms to queer cyborg feminisms, degrowth and eco-militarism to indigenous futuring and environmental justice studies. The course will interrogate Northern discussions of the Green New Deal but also highlight perspectives from more marginalized perspectives from cosmopolitics to indigenous political ecologies. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; HPSS-S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates. &lt;BR&gt; Also offered as NCSS-714G; Register in the course for which credit is desired.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at the academy, the institution and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices and their cultural frameworks from the 1990s to the present. Frequent studio visits will occur and drive some of the reading and discussion. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective &lt;br&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING REFOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide variety of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting - but not its most traditional conventions. Encouraging idiosyncratic, individualistic art making with a heightened attention to the tactile nature of materials students will explore visual culture through informed readings and targeted artists. "Art supplies" will come from Home Depot and recycling as much as Utrecht and Blick. Employing the recycled, the found and gathered, the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning. Assignments will be introduced through the screening of classic Sci-Fi films that will act as a prompt for each project.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective; open to all majors.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

An historical and cultural perspective will be introduced to inform ongoing color studies executed in the studio. Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; open to all majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY PREHISTORY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, required for painting majors in spring semester of sophomore year, describes five defining features of modernity, providing the broad historical backdrop for their "invention": the individual, globalization, nature, industrialization, and abstraction. The first half of the class will be devoted to the visual art of varied geographic and cultural settings prior to and during the rise of these paradigms. The second half of the class slows to focus in greater detail on the high modernist manifestations of each of those themes (interiority, capital, environment, technology, and narrative), and uses them to contextualize the art and culture of the 20th century. Periods, places, and subjects will be introduced through secondary sources, providing a critical lens through which to connect the material to present day art, culture, politics, and experience (for instance, the rise of global trade will be seen through the lens of postcolonial theory). The material for the course ends at approximately 1989, setting the stage for a more in-depth look at contemporary art, culture, and criticism in their junior year course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore major requirement; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be designed to develop confidence and experience with paint and painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language for critiques. No prior painting experience is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; open to senior and above. &lt;BR&gt;Permission of Instructor required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a hands-on course, designed for advanced painting students who are fascinated by color, surface, transformation and alchemy, DIY processes, craftmanship, invention, and the stuff of paint. It is for those who are eager to dive deep into all sorts of materials, methods and techniques.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The objective of the class is to arm students with the tools and resources to figure out how to make what they imagine and to expand their practice through material exploration and information sharing. With an emphasis on experimentation, play, research and development; advanced students explore, problem solve and implement specific grounds, paints, supports, mediums and tools into their own practices.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The level of specialization and expertise students may eventually desire for their work could require seeking the advice of paint manufacturers, conservators, fabricators, other artists or even experts in other fields.  How to identify and acquire knowledge outside of one's comfort zone, approaching and finding a common terminology with peers and specialists is also a part of this course. Relevant art historical and contemporary methodologies, techniques and materials will be presented. Environmental Health and Safety guidelines that apply to painting practice and painting studio safety will be an integral part of this course. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective; Painting majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course presents the graduate student with a series of problems intended to develop drawing as a tool for inquiry into a terrain outside the well-known beaten paths of his/her past studio practice. Expanding the role for drawing in studio experimentation is a goal. Work will be done outside class. There are critiques each week. &lt;i&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Graduate major requirement &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by Painting Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR HONORS INTERDISCIPLINARY CRITIQUE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course in which first-semester seniors who have already demonstrated unusual commitment, ambition and initiative within their majors will pursue and discuss independent work in a setting that reflects, as closely as possible, the interdisciplinary conversation that actually takes place around advanced art practice today. The course is intended to allow those working within medium-specific vocabularies to test how their work will make meaning in an art world in which a variety of disciplinary histories and conventions coexist, clash, and inform one another, as well as to provide an opportunity for students whose work bridges two or more disciplines (or involves performance/new genres/post-studio approaches) to learn from one another and from faculty capable of addressing all of these sorts of practices. This is a demanding critique course with additional seminar components (readings, screenings, discussions, slide presentations, etc.), and as such students can expect a workload equivalent to a core studio requirement within their major. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Acceptance into the course will be based on a GPA of 3.25 or greater as well as the recommendation of faculty and department heads from the student's major and on review of previous work. Candidates will be identified in discussions between the instructor and department heads during the preceding spring semester. Successful completion of THAD-H490/PAINT-4507 (Contemporary Art &amp; its Discourses) or equivalent coursework is a prerequisite, ensuring students have a shared understanding of the art historical context for interdisciplinary. The maximum enrollment is limited to seminar-size (c. 15 students) in order to provide sufficient attention to each student's work in group and individual critiques while still allowing for seminar-style discussions &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES IN PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course would address many practical issues to do with becoming a professional artist after graduation. Some of these issues are: the commercial gallery, the not-for-profit gallery, museums, graduate programs, auction houses, grants, documentation of work, archival storage of work and restoration of artwork. Professionals from the gallery, museum and other fields will be invited to the class to share their expertise with the student. Artists will be invited to talk about their professional experiences. It is a seminar class addressed particularly to the senior painting student.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Painting majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Non-majors by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THREE CRITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Three Critics" will offer graduate students the opportunity to get inside the art critic's head and learn how writers think about the visual. Students will be exposed to a wide range of viewpoints and discourse on contemporary art issues as defined by the interests of three different, practicing critics. Each critic will become part of the RISD community for approximately one month, conducting 3 sessions on campus and one in New York or Boston. On-campus meetings will consist of lectures, reading and writing assignments, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits. Off-campus trips will include visits to museums, galleries and artist studios. Small groups of students will be expected to lead several classes. Outside coursework and full participation in class discussion required for successful completion.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; second-year graduate Painting students.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Painting Department, course not available via web registration. &lt;br&gt; Five additional seats available for Fine Arts graduate students. For admission, students submit a one-page writing sample to the Painting Graduate Program Director.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FOREGROUND/BACKGROUND: INTERPLAY BETWEEN SURFACE AND IMAGERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the majority of drawing takes place on mass-produced, white paper, the surface on which a drawing is created is an important aspect of a drawing's composition and meaning.  Color, texture, and materials of both surface and imagery all contribute to the final image. This course will focus on creating paper grounds as an integral part of the final composition. These grounds may even come to the forefront, evolving into distinct pieces that exist on their own.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  This class will be split into two phases:  The first half of the class will be dedicated to the creation of paper grounds.  Students will explore the process of making paper from start to finish. In the creation of sheets, students will learn coloring, painting, and pouring with pulp.  Each sheet will become a unique composition, an original background or foreground.  During the second half of the class, students will explore making drawings on their individual grounds.  The relationship between imagery and surface will be consciously explored in order to develop multiple layers of meaning.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRIMARY SOURCES ILLUMINATING THE OCEAN DEEP AT THE NEW BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MONSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate cultural traditions of the "monster", broadly defined as an entity of horrific other-ness. Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This fully-remote 6-credit critique-based studio will help students deepen and expand on the interests already present in their practices despite / in response to / through the lens of the present confluence of crises. All artists concerned with the ability of their work to respond meaningfully to continual upheaval will find support for their efforts here (sometimes in the form of difficult questions). Traditional approaches to artmaking will coexist alongside topical, collective, and activist strategies. Individual and group critiques, seminar components, and guided independent work time will highlight the potential for intimacy, productive vulnerability, and community responsibility to be found in online formats. The content of all work made for the class will be addressed directly, and the values and wellbeing of each artist -as a whole person -will be emphasized in considering the development of practices sustainable in the long term. Flexible synchronous and asynchronous content will aim to meet the needs of all students. The course will be taught by faculty with extensive experience of (and healthy skepticism about) online studio education, and is open to students at all levels. Substitution for major credit in Painting I, III, or Workshop will be accepted.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective; open to seniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of department required; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and department permission. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BOOKMAKING FOR THE PHOTOGRAPHER: THE SEQUENCE AND BINDING METHODS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over the past decade, photography books have seen a resurgence within the art world, this time transcending their original use as survey or catalog to become ideal spaces and platforms to experience and disseminate work.  Today image-based printed matter functions in a multitude of ways, all of which at their core are driven by the mechanics of sequence and editing. Through class discussions, using RISD's Fleet Library and Special Collections, and individual research - students will form a personal vision of what images mean in the book form. Our focus will be equally on content, concept, production &amp; technique. The semester will culminate in each student having devised, sequenced, edited and produced a fully resolved and realized photography book. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TIME-BASED PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Time-Based Photography will wrestle with the mercurial and ever-evolving subject of Time-Based art. What is Time-Based art? Is it simply art with durational elements that unfold over the course of the work?  Is it art that depends on time to define itself? Is it art that can only exist within the confines of regulated space? Is it art that stands firmly in the aftermath of what preceded it? Is it art that keeps time, wastes time, witnesses time, changes time, rearranges time, or records time?  In this course, we will explore and welcome work being made under the broad umbrella of Time-Based work, such as: documentary photography, video art, experimental film, performance art, recorded happenings, social practice, and sculpture made with temporal dimensions.  The course will operate as a studio course, with students being asked to present work for critique regularly, as well as weekly discussions of historical and contemporary investigations and demonstrations of Time-Based art.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;BR&gt; Deposit for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is photography? What does it do, influence, affect, position, package, demand, suppress, communicate, radicalize? This course is designed to provide students entering the photography department with an overview of contemporary thinking and practice in lens-based media. It considers photography's impact on our culture and our lives. We need, use, and react to photographs in their many forms for many reasons: this is the spine of the course. Lectures, debates, in-class activities, and screenings will familiarize students with an expansive range of genres, working methods, subject/content, and critical issues relevant to contemporary practice. The focus of this course is on work produced within the last 30 to 40 years. Lectures are organized around major themes and approaches. Critical thinking and analysis of images will be encouraged through assignments that ask students to read and respond to photographs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Photo majors &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Photo Departent, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMINISM &amp; EXPERIMENTAL PHOTOGRAPHIC PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How have female-identifying artists used non-traditional forms of image-making as a means of resisiting the dominant idea of the photograph as an observation of the world? In a recent issue of Aperture Magazine, Eva Respini writes that many female-identifying artists today use experiemental photographic processes to "look inward - towards the studio, still life, re-photography, material experimentation [and] non-representation." This course will begin with an introduction to feminist theory and visual culture in order to set up our in-depth investigation of those female-identifying artists who combine experimental methods with photography, using appropriation, collage, books/zines, hand work, and abstraction. These artists will serve as a reference and guide as students explore non-traditional processes in their own studio practice. Class time will be divided between close readings of artists' work, lectures, small group discussions, hands-on demonstrations and critique, in addition to visiting artist lectures and occasional field trips. Course work will culminate with each student choosing a particular process or processes to weave into a final, cohesive body of work that participates in the discourse on feminism and visual culture. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 Deposit: $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an introduction to photographic methods and ideas. Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course all photo majors should take to help launch their careers, whatever the specialty-fine art, fashion, commercial, editorial. Classes will include lectures and instruction by the professor and outside experts, covering the breadth of issues professional photographers face, such as building their portfolio, promoting their work, finding jobs, keeping financial records, and legal issues, such as copyright, and model releases.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The core of the class involves field trips to visit artists and other photography professionals in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. Those visited include many RISD photo graduates who have gone on to make careers in photography, and others who have something to teach about the many issues facing contemporary photographers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Note that the schedule of the class varies somewhat from most Wintersession classes because it includes a five-day trip to New York and Philadelphia, during the fourth week of Wintersession. The exact schedule will be available before registration opens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt; Open to all majors. &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making. We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them. We'll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers. Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.) Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduate and graduate students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*FRANCE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN PARIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over a period of five weeks, students will come to know well the magnificent city of Paris with its abundant museums, significant architecture, atmospheric parks and intimate cafes. Paris and its environs will be the catalyst for inspiring students of all levels of photography to begin or to continue to develop technical skills and to explore personal visions.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In discussions on the work of past and contemporary photographers, in-group critiques which investigate "learning how to see" and how to create "good" photographs, and in individual meetings, students are encourage to respond in unique ways to photographic problems.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The class begins with the use of film and the black and white analog darkroom. Students are encouraged to have a 35mm SLR film camera or larger. Using film and the 35mm camera as the beginning tool for employing the visual language of art, students will process film and print in the well-appointed and maintained facility of the Photography Studies in France (Speos). Once everyone has worked in the darkroom, we will move onto working with digital cameras and it is hoped that students will have a DSLR. In support of the digital part of the class there will be classes in Lightroom, Adobe Photoshop and a special class in creating a perfect file for output at a lab. The Speos building is located in the 11th arrondisement of Paris near the Bastille. In addition, field trips outside the city will introduce students to the countryside, as well as afford further photographic opportunities. The study of photography in Paris is sure to have an impact on the creative life of a student at any level of photography in immeasurable ways! &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Applications open in September. Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; All students are required to remain in good academic standing in order to participate in the WS travel course/studio.  A minimum gpa of 2.5 is required.  Failure to remain in good academic standing can lead to removal from the course, either before or during the course. Also in cases where WS travel courses and studios do not reach student capacity, the course may be cancelled after the last day of Wintersession travel course registration. As such, all students are advised not to purchase flights for participation in Wintersession travel courses until the course is confirmed to run, which happens within the week after the final Wintersession travel course registration period. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;br&gt; Open to first year students with approval from the Dean of Experimental and Foundation Studies.  &lt;BR&gt; 2020WS Travel Cost: $5,315.00 - airfare not included.&lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHY &amp; RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does 'research' mean for contemporary photographers? For artists using photography within their practice? This hands-on studio course investigates and critiques the nature and scope of research and its practical application to current practice, and how research provides a critical context to help develop awareness, extend subject knowledge, and inform the creation of new artistic work. We will learn through current case studies, unpicking what kinds of processes photographers use when making work. We will investigate to what extent individual practices differ and what analogies can be drawn across those practices.  We will look at the roles of instinct and serendipity in allowing for other ideas to emerge. You will develop and hone your own research methods through a wide variety of experimental making and writing assignments, and through critique. This course is also a research project in itself, bringing together examples of photographic practice for you to ponder and engage into our own ideas, processes, and projects. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to junior and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major as an elective. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED SILKSCREEN: LARGE SCREEN PRINT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is intended to build on a basic Screen print foundation. Beginning with fine tuning basic stencil making and registration and printing techniques. The course will move on to working big. It's what screen printing can do more efficiently and in a lower cost-effective way than any other traditional printmaking technique. The class will cover printing with a one arm squeegee designed for printing large stencils and on a 10-foot fabric/paper printing table made to print along lengths of paper or fabric, joining each impression to the previous one to create continuous surfaces.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Methods for producing handmade stencils to making the matrix from fine dot digitally made positives will be demonstrated and taught. Screen printing on substrates from fabrics, rolled paper, rag sheets and other surfaces will be explored.  Images can involve repeated pattern, be large scale image oriented, or tiled depending on each student's individual content issues and image needs. In the second half of the semester the students will embark on a research project aimed at; producing a large-scale print or series of large scale prints, printed fabric yardage, rolled wallpaper, installation. A proposal due at mid semester will serve as a starting point for the project it should speak to; focus and direction, content and form, the techniques and strategies planned, how will the stencils be made; handmade photo, computer generated half tones or line, what materials, tools will you use what will you print on. What artist influence the work? What do you look to and at for inspiration? &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Building on the students pre-existing experience with the materials and process of etching, this course will focus on advanced intaglio practices and methodologies. Primary techniques covered will include experimental copperplate etching, polymer-plate processing/printing, and various other unique plating approaches that utilize aspects of other print-processes and tools; monotype, relief, and screenprinting. The plate, or printing-surface/matrix, will become as important as the printed image or multiple. Assignments will be guided by prompts that require students to push the plating material to new and unexpected places, and to begin to consider ways in which the plate figures in as "finished" work. The two main course projects, a midterm and final, will both be self-directed.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SCULPTURAL PRINT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Sculptural Print looks to the multiple as a material (rather than a form) for the construction of one-of-a-kind works. The primary technical focuses will be in photo-emulsion based screenprinting, polymer-plate etching/intaglio, and basic relief printing. Students will be asked to design unique image vocabularies, transform and translate them to various matrices, and then to alter, manipulate, reimagine, and finally to build structural pieces using the printed matter. In the first half of the term, class sessions will begin with a presentation of artist precedents and technical demonstrations. In the second half, classes will still begin with a short presentation, and will then focus largely on in-progress critique and technical troubleshooting/consultation. Works completed for midterm will be based on provided prompts with detailed parameters and require students to work in series and at a large-scale. The final will be fully self-directed.   &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $125.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINT CULTURE: LEARNING PRINT HISTORY THROUGH OBJECT-BASED STUDY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>For centuries prints have been made, dispersed, and collected, spreading images and ideas across the globe. What can close study of prints and printed objects tell us about the cultures that made them, the historical viewers who engaged with them, the collectors who assembled them, and the historians, curators and librarians who continue to study them? How can these historical printed objects speak to the present and provide inspiration for contemporary makers? Lucky for us, Providence is a repository for prints from many cultures and time periods. Using the holdings at RISD, Brown, the Providence Public Library, the Providence Athenaeum, the Rhode Island Historical Society, and other public and private collections, this course will provide an in-depth study of prints and print culture. In the process, we will engage with topics and themes such as the inventions of movable type and the printing press, multiplicity, the circulation of images, collecting, the relationship of text and image, and the impact of digital culture. Students will learn a range of research methods relating to working with prints and will develop an independent collection-based research project. &lt;bR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINT INSTALLATION AND CONTEMPORARY PRINT MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Printmaking's inclusive nature allows for many different approaches and opportunities. Motivated by historic, sociological, political and media driven revolutions, printmaking has undergone significant shifts throughout history.  The current world of image proliferation and rapid technological innovations have pushed the traditional boundaries of printmaking even further in the contemporary art world.  Many of today's artists are creating large-scale installations utilizing the printed multiple in many distinctive ways.   Through process and scale, students will examine the interrelated nature of form, multiples, expression, and meaning.  The course will explore permanent, temporary and site-specific installation based art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective, available to non-majors on a space available basis. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is structured according the notion that artists can use what is on hand to research and craft simple solutions to the complex physical, mechanical, and technical problems that must be routinely addressed in their making practices. This material and process based, hands-on, research studio will be structured in response to the issues that the advanced fine arts student is grappling with on a regular basis. Many of the issues that arise in the process of making provide the opportunity to transcend perceived material-based boundaries and thinking. Some of the questions this course attends to include: How do you defy gravity? How do you generate the hidden components required to physicalize the thing we can see in our mind's eye? How is the magic we need to create our work scalable to the resources we have readily available? Example working processes include: mig welding, tig welding, casting for prototyping, woodworking, and mold making. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to fine arts majors only; juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED CRITICAL ISSUES SEMINAR II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Critical Issues Seminar 2 introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for thinking and writing about contemporary sculpture practice. Each seminar develops from a specific theme drawing on research from Grad Critical Issues 1, current debates in the field and contemporary events. Past seminars include: Artificial Natures, Precarious Relations, Frankenstein and Crime, Vanishing Points, as examples. Trespassing across sculpture, performance, cinema, fiction, feminist, queer, race and political theory and back again, we will address writings by Walter Benjamin, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Jacques Rancire (as examples) in conversation with contemporary artists writings and projects to cultivate a conceptual grammar to extend to our studio practice. Approaching issues in contemporary sculpture through these discursive perspectives generates new strategies simultaneously material, conceptual, and critical. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Sculpture majors only.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department, course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will discuss, experiment and challenge the notion of metal as traditional industrial workhorse, or as coveted art object and embrace or reject these ideas as we create with this medium. Students will be encouraged to pursue other nontraditional uses of metal, through scavenging, collecting, transforming metal from various states into new surfaces and forms. With safety and ingenuity we will put into practice work of the hand and machine, use computer driven techniques in tandem with the deliberate and accidental to experiment with pattern, surface, line, form and color. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to non-majors as a non-major elective. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuiation of Sculptural Practices I. Students are introduced to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this hands-on studio we will explore both the history and potential of the open source movement as it relates to art, design, and its production. Specifically, we will build upon, modify, hack, and create new open source tools, workflows, and platforms that aid in the production of original artworks. The semester will begin with a series of projects in which students gain familiarity with the norms and practices of open source collaboration, development, and publishing. From there, students will have the opportunity to devise and use an example of open hardware in the creation of an original body of work. ?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Topics include: bootstrapping, hacking, intellectual property, licensure and attribution, speculative fiction, Cyberpunk aesthetics, Afrofuturism, Shanzhai, additive and subtractive fabrication, physical computing, motion control systems, experimental materials, digital distribution, and dissemination. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3-DIMENSIONAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How do artists know which graphical tools to use when they have a need to represent sculptural objects? Throughout human history, many uniquely propositional graphic works depicting sculptural objects in space have reflected properties, methods and materials that are native to the technological advances of their era. In this era of digital ubiquity, the cutting edge manual tools at the origins of dimensional representation can be easily overlooked or forgotten.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This studio proposes a fresh look at those analog tools and methods of 3 dimensional representation by remaking, bending and hacking them. Experiencing and rethinking these manual tools and methods in parallel with learning the core basics in 3D Software, (Rhino 3D) we will build pathways toward individualized methods of dimensional drawing for sculpture. This studio will engage the Sculpture Department's Digital Fabrication Lab and provide students with the core software skills to use digital 3D output within the department and CoWorks.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Students will experience methods in observational, technical, digital and photographic tools that may be harnessed, combined, bent and hacked to aid problem solving in object creation. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP STUDIO ELECTIVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Independent studio is at the core of the EHP experience. Upon arrival, students are assigned studio space at the Palazzetto Cenci, home of RISD's program in Rome. With guidance from the chief critic, each student develops a personal body of work sparked by his/her interactions with places, people and circumstances in Rome and other locations that are part of the EHP tours (such as the Northern, Southern or Eastern tours, as well as other shorter trips.) The work takes as a point of departure knowledge and techniques specific to individual home departments, but allows, and even encourages, explorations beyond disciplinary boundaries, including collaborations and cross-fertilization within a group of students from different departments working together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Beyond consistent and thorough engagement with studio work, requirements include participation in open studios and exhibitions, presentations in reviews, and attendance to all group activities and events, such as lectures at the Cenci and other institutions. From time to time, the chief critic may issue short assignments to introduce or focus on a particular subject. As part of the studio elective, students may be encouraged to keep sketchbooks and/or diaries, participate in optional activities--such as figure drawing sessions--and search for brief internships, apprenticeships, or other forms of interactions with local artists, designers, curators and critics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  EHP Studio Elective corresponds to the first twelve weeks of the program, while students are also taking Art History and Italian classes. This course establishes the direction for the work in the "Studio Concentration" course that follows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   Note: EHP credits replace the on-campus major requirements for the term students attend. Distribution to non-major requirements occurs when major credits are not needed.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this intensive studio elective students will explore, create, and critique a series of performative works which migrate from one medium to another - stage, screen, and sculpture, and the connections and intersections between. Students will leave the class with a working knowledge of practical video techniques using Adobe Premier, After Effects, 3D mapping platforms, projectors, monitors, and expanded installation techniques. Authorship and the relationship of the artist or performer to the frame or stage will be a driving focus of the course, as will the poetics and politics of representation and popularity in story-telling and digital media. With the assumption that no images remain forever frozen in time, meaning, or identity students will be encouraged to consider portraiture and performance as fluid, and poetically, unstable acts.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is an introduction to the six major practices that are essential to the study of Sculpture. These practices include an introduction to wood, digital imaging, plaster, performance, installation, and metal. Over the course of the year, students will be exposed to four week intensives designed to augment their major studio experience. The course begins with wood to expedite the speed of moving from ideation to physicality. From wood, the group moves to digital imaging where basic skills in video editing, photographic documentation, and projection within the built environment are explored. Plaster as a medium is paired with performance as an activity, both of which underscore the importance of the body within the field of Sculpture. Once students have produced objects, videos, and performances, the group moves into considering the fundamentals of installation and metal fabrication so that the architectures that house myriad artworks can be understood as part of the modality of Sculpture. Students can expect to learn proficiency and safety in all of these areas. Students can expect to expand these skills in advanced studio electives in the Junior and Senior years. This course is required for all Sophomore Sculpture majors.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Sculpture majors only. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture Department; course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RETOOLING THE STUDIO TOOL KIT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is structured according the notion that artists can use what is on hand to research and craft simple solutions to the complex physical, mechanical, and technical problems that must be routinely addressed in their making practices. This material and process based, hands-on, research studio will be structured in response to the issues that the advanced fine arts student is grappling with on a regular basis. Many of the issues that arise in the process of making provide the opportunity to transcend perceived material-based boundaries and thinking. Some of the questions this course attends to include: How do you defy gravity? How do you generate the hidden components required to physicalize the thing we can see in our mind's eye? How is the magic we need to create our work scalable to the resources we have readily available? Example working processes include: mig welding, tig welding, casting for prototyping, woodworking, and mold making. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to fine arts majors only; juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INSTALLATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course will examine the expansive nature of installation and its prominent place in contemporary art discourse, both within and outside of institutional settings. The emphasis will not be on making what is termed 'Installation Art' but engaging with strategies and situations where artistic action/production can take place. We will examine the historical lineages surrounding installation, while considering its critical capacities in relation to site, intervention, bodies, public vs. private, the archive, and representation. Assignments allow for students to work in various media and to focus on the process and methodology for developing ambitious ideas, both materially and conceptually. We will deconstruct the ways in which the subject can offer multiple viewpoints and allow for the spectator to take on active and engaged roles. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; This class is not defined by or limited to a specific technical or artistic discipline. Students should be prepared to challenge the boundaries and limitations of materials, media, and space. The assignments and readings are designed to act as instigators for each student's studio and intellectual work. Experimentation and improvisation will be strongly encouraged, if not expected. The intention is to maintain, advance and expand robust artmaking processes within the mode of installation-based work. There will be group critiques of developed work throughout the semester in addition to lectures, screenings and discussions. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major elective. &lt;BR&gt; ?Open to junior and above?. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of Department.

   <COURSETITLE>OPERATIONAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is Operational Drawing? This considers the question by making works that address how we image the body in time and space with tools and media. Akin to dance, drawing just might be the next human activity that engages a spontaneous simultaneous interplay of thought, action and acting upon. In this studio we will be working together and individually to explore how drawing relates to your studio practice. Drawing has often been mistakenly viewed as a preparatory or even secondary element within traditional studio practices such as painting, sculpture and printmaking. Today, in an expanded field, those outmoded viewpoints only stand to unfairly discriminate and rank modes of realizing concept and form. It is also true that this archaic view of drawing has origins in the humble materials often associated within the practice, such as charcoal, graphite, chalk, and carbon black (ink). These geological elements on top of skin like substrates were once the defining features of the activity, but in a contemporary studio practice it is the artist's prerogative to either work with or challenge historical presets. The role of drawing in a contemporary studio practice may play multiple roles. Together we will look at, practice and explore that very thing through installations, group projects and large scale immersive work.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OBJECTS OF USE: PERFORMANCE MEETS SCULPTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This online course explores the point of contact between sculpture and performance. Temporal and spatial dimensions of both sculpture and performance will be discussed in terms of the performance "prop," sculptural outcomes of performance, and performance that emerges from embodied relationships with sculpture. We will examine performance in its social, political, formal, and corporeal aspects, engaging questions of ritual, labor, and movement, with a particular focus on everyday objects in the sphere of the domestic. Approaching sculpture in both the conventional and the "expanded" senses of the term, we will pose the question of immaterial sculptural forms and actions. We will consider immaterial sculpture as performance while also considering traditional sculpture's material concerns as performative. Sculptural material engagements of process and technique; site and context; and objects and objecthood will all be examined. Art historical and political questions of power, agency, audience, gaze, attention, and passivity will take shape as we theorize and enact performativity and its relation to embodiment, display, and language. Through individual and collaborative work, students will create and critique performances with objects and objects that perform. A range of text, sound, lens, online, application-based, and object-based documentation will be encouraged, as we make works that emerge from our disparate locations and are mediated by the full range of perceptual technologies.   &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to Sculpture majors only; seniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL EMBROIDERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  A series of small assignments will build up a repertoire of techniques and culminate in a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personalized images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration for Spring semester.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORLD TEXTILES: TRADE, TRADITIONS, TECHNIQUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology from around the globe will be explored in classroom lecture and utilizing the RISD Museum of Art. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Thoughtful and scholarly consideration will be given to recent incidents of cultural appropriation in the global textile and fashion industry. Term projects utilizing the material culture approach will afford students the opportunity to gain valuable research skills and explore in-depth specific textile techniques. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Textiles majors can be pre-registered by the department. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Trolls, bots and memes oh my!  In the forest of online hocus-pocus, where does form and material exploration IRL exist? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of image and material appropriation through textile-based study and construction.  We will engage with rudimentary forms of  off-loom weaving, hand knitting, felting and latch hook rug techniques as they pertain to building sculptural form.  Students will be introduced to histories of artists and designers as well as explore methodologies of montage, trompe l'oeil and collage through lectures, readings and visits to the RISD Museum's Costume Collection.  We will look at such artists as Betye Saar, Shinique Smith, Stan Brakhage, Josh Faught, Mike Kelley, Marcel Duchamp, Jessica Stockholder, Hannah Hch, Wangechi Mutu and Wendy Red Star.  The class will explore pattern making, re-using and recycling materials to new ends and applying methodologies and techniques to unorthodox materials.   Students in the course do not need a background in textiles or sculpture, but should be open and ready to experiment, discuss and explore individually and as a group. The final week of the class will be the making of a work that will bring together the threads of the previous weeks' exploration, experimentation and study.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  A series of small assignments will build up a repertoire of techniques and culminate in a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personalized images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective &lt;br&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration for Spring semester.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MATERIALITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The material qualities of textile design and fabriction refer to our relationship to all aspects of the physical and tangible world. While computation has long been responsible for pushing the traditional techniques of textiles to high levels of mechanical industrial expression, digital sensibility and know-how of digital technologies are now increasingly seen as means to push the frontier and very definition of "fabric." Parallel advances in digital fabrication and the invention of smart materials now allow for added dimensionality and functinality in fabric, and computation is a key interface for material exploration. In this course, students will learn to modulate the performance and behavior of fabric through its geometry and other systems of continuious structural surface within a computational framework. This students will provide studetns with the opportunity to push the boundaries of fabric design across disciplines and studio proactices. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: Varies by project.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to juniors and above. &lt;BR&gt; Permission of Instructor required. &lt;BR&gt; Registration by Textiles, course not available via web registration. &lt;BR&gt;Also offered as IDISC-2350; Register in the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RENAISSANCE FLORENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This social history of Renaissance art in Florence includes the study of drawing, painting, sculpture, and architecture from about 1250 to 1500. Our approach will be at once chronological and thematic, examining the visual culture of political power structures. Beginning with the concept of Renaissance as rebirth, the private and public spaces of the city of Florence shall be traced and investigated. In a period of massive transition in the arts, Italo-Byzantine mosaics and the Pisan sculptural tradition will give way to the panorama of public sculpture and performance art in a guild-driven republic. Painting techniques and the practice of disegno will be presented in terms of artistic training and apprenticeship. The expansion of the Medici family's influence and power can be witnessed according to Cosimo's building campaigns and art in the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent.  Mythological and religious subjects will be studied in context according to patronage and intellectual trends.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to undergraduates sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As a field of study, material culture explores how we make things and how things, in turn, make us. This class examines the material culture of late consumer capitalism, focusing on how objects organize experience in everyday life. We will investigate the practices through which things-from food and clothing to smart phones-become meaningful, as we tackle political and ethical questions related to the design, manufacture, use and disposal of material goods. The class will introduce students to a range of scholarship on material culture from several disciplinary perspectives including anthropology, history, sociology, art and architectural history, and cultural studies. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This class will examine various kinds of drawings from the history of art and visual culture moving chronologically from the medieval to the post-modern. Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This seminar is recommended for THAD concentrators and students especially interested in drawing. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

Organized thematically, with examples drawn from painting, sculpture, photography, film, popular culture and mixed media installations, we examine how the deployment, manipulations and construction of the signification of the asexualized mammy complex is juxtaposed against the jezebel vixen in a shifting terrain from the antebellum era through the post-racial decade of the 21st century. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How do we interpret art and visual culture? How does the meaning of an individual work of visual art change over historical time? This course will examine a variety of answers to these questions. The class will be run as a colloquium of individual episodes in the interpretation of art from antiquity to the present day. We will look at visual culture through the lenses of: style, form, Iconography, Marxism, Feminism, Queer Theory, Prehistory, Psychoanalysis, Deconstruction, artist's biography, reproductions and facsimiles of art, conservation of objects, Orientalism, museum studies, contemporary art magazines, and more.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; The course material consists of lectures and readings. Students will be graded on the following criteria: attendance, in-class writing assignments, and group discussions. Preparation of readings is essential.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This course is recommended for THAD concentrators and fulfills the "Historiography/ Methodology" concentration requirement.  &lt;BR&gt;All interested undergraduate and graduate students are welcome. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TEA, COFFEE OR CHOCOLATE? THE VISUAL AND MATERIAL CULTURE OF EXOTIC DRINKS IN PRE-INDUSTRIAL EUROPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We are so familiar with these three hot drinks but they became commodities and part of our everyday only recently. This course explores what values were attached to these plants before the era of industrialized production, i.e. before ca. 1800. We will survey how Westerners adopted these beverages by looking at medical theories, the issue of morality, and the expansion of sugar production. We will also study how the craving for these products reinforced or even spurred slavery in French, Dutch, and English colonies. Special attention is dedicated to how ritual behavior affects design in terms of the sociability around these beverages, required manners, and the tableware crafted for them. The methodology is based on the analysis of images, discussions of assigned readings, written responses, visits to museums (RISD and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), and touring the facility of a chocolate artisan. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE STUFF OF AMERICA: POSTWAR MATERIAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar examines the postwar production of modernity in the Americas vis--vis the raw and synthetic materials that provided its physical makeup. In a period of rapid, but irregular, industrialization throughout the hemisphere, many artists and architects made use of unconventional materials to visualize, interrogate, or otherwise manifest the tensions endemic to modernization. Some turned to technological innovations such as concrete and Plexiglas to signal the dawn of a new, utopian era; still others incorporated natural materials like gold, sugar, and oil to call attention to a colonialist history of resource extraction and commodification. Proceeding thematically rather than regionally or chronologically, we will consider a series of case studies that foreground the materials of American modernity-not only as they materialize in discrete works of art or architecture, but also as they proliferate across larger, more diffuse networks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MARKETS, MEMORIES, AND RADICAL IMAGININGS OF EVIDENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Old Market House building, completed in 1775, was the first public market house in Providence. Designed by the architect of the oldest building on Brown University's campus in collaboration with a signer of the Declaration of Independence; this market housed food vendors, masons, soldiers, and politicians who conducted business across four centuries within its walls, making it arguably the most historic home of commerce in the city. During its past, this same building (now a RISD owned property) was also the hub of a different type of commerce, and operated as a very different type of market; a slave market to be precise. In this course, students will utilize techniques from their degree programs along with digital humanities tools to create community-engaged projects/works that reckon with Market House's past, while acknowledging that its past is not separate from our present. That we indeed exist in what Christina Sharpe calls "the ongoingness of the conditions of capture." Given the myriad of possible acts of participation and/or complicity with enslavement that took place in the Market House Building, and Market Square overall, students will be exposed to scholarly research on the slave pens, slave markets, slave jails, and auction blocks that proliferated the United States, Rhode Island in particular, during both the transatlantic and intra-state slave trades. Students will study how literalist demands for evidence impact the pasts, memories, and historical narratives of slavery that do and do not make it onto the public landscape. Moreover, through different assignments during the semester students will interrogate and unpack their own relationships to evidence as a concept. This course is an invitation to undertake a series of speculative arguments within, against, and beyond multiple archives; to use radical research methodologies to accept Saidiya Hartman's task to "tell an impossible story, and amplify the impossibility of its telling" no matter the evidence, or supposed lack thereof. Please note, this is a year long course, and students are encouraged to commit to both semesters, however they may sign up for the fall or spring independently, space permitting.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POWER, DEPENDENCE AND SOCIAL WELFARE IN EARLY MODERN VISUAL CULTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the visual culture of social welfare and justice during the early modern era (1500-1900). A powerful guild of silk manufacturers sponsored the construction of the first large-scale orphanage for abandoned children in Renaissance Florence, employing architects, painters, woodworkers and sculptors. "Talking statues" in Rome advocated for the end of oppressive taxation by over-zealous popes.  Printmakers across Europe turned out satirical woodcuts and engravings that graphically argued for better living conditions and labor laws in the age of industrialization.  Josiah Wedgewood issued a plaque that poignantly pleaded for the abolishment of slavery.  Here, we study a broad range of imagery, objects and architecture that forged a language of social justice that still exists today.  Drawing on the rich collections of the RISD Museum, Fleet Library Special Collections and the John Hay Library at Brown, among others, we examine the role of patrons, artists and designers in advocating for, and advancing, social welfare in an increasingly urban and educated society.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EHP ART HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course entails nine classes and nine on-site lectures. The classes offer a selection of themes and moments in the history of forms and aesthetic ideas during the history of Rome (of Italy and the Western culture). The on-site lectures to archeological sites, churches, museums, monuments and places of the highest artistic interest underline the artworks in their topographic, environmental and historic context. The purpose is to offer a broad range of possible analyses: from the function of the object/monument to its design; from its stylistic idiom to the taste and culture of the art patron to the individual inclination of the artist.&lt;br&gt; In short the objectives of the class are the following: observe artworks and architecture in the original context and function; recreate the original context by adding or taking away spurious elements; explain the aesthetics of that specific period; make formal and stylistic analyses of the artwork: its conventions, its innovations; explain the imagery, i. e.,iconography /subject matter; -learn a vocabulary pertinent to the historic context.&lt;br&gt; The tools the class uses are: observation, taking notes, asking questions, readings.&lt;br&gt; Each class will be detailed by a "class syllabus", a "glossary" and a list of the slides.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY ART SINCE 1960</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will trace major developments in contemporary art from the 1960s to the present. Beginning with the shift away from modernist abstraction in the late 1950s and proceeding chronologically, we will examine the diverse array of movements, practices, and events that have come to define the larger field of contemporary art: minimalism, conceptualism, and pop in the 1960s, site specific and performance art in the 1970s, the "culture wars" and postmodernist debates of the 1980s, and the various forms of "abject," project-based, and "relational" art that followed. Foregrounding problems that have remained central for artists throughout this period - the status of the body, the institutional conditions of artistic production and reception, the politics of representation and difference - we will focus on putting the shifting terrain of contemporary art into broad social, historical, and theoretical perspective. In turn, we will attempt to develop a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the aesthetic and political stakes of contemporary art today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FORMS OF NATURE: THE ENVIRONMENT IN ART AND ARCHITECTURAL HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course studies the diversity of ways that humans have conceived of nature and wilderness. It seeks to understand the deep historicity and variety of such conceptions by following a few theoretical threads that span over vast reaches of time and space as well as across the multiple disciplines constituting the environmental humanities.  We begin with modern debates over the significance of nature and wilderness.  Through related explorations of the landscape in postwar art, we travel back in time to study the garden as a microcosm that both resists and mediates wilderness.   We then return gradually to the present to understand how modern architects and engineers mobilized conceptions of nature for colonial and economic ends.  The course concludes by introducing debates on the Anthropocene and the "end" of nature that draw on postcolonial theory, literary criticism, and ethnography. Through readings, discussions and presentations, students will learn to critically identify and distinguish the range of human expressions of nature with appreciation for historical, cultural, and ideological differences. They will also develop their ability to make connections between texts and cultural products including visual arts, architecture, and landscape architecture.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL AESTHETICS: WRITING ABOUT ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this introductory workshop on the professional practice of critical writing for artists and designers, students will compose short-form analyses of their own work, that of their classmates, and works in the risd Museum. Topics to be considered will include the durational experience of looking at static objects (we will spend several sessions attending to single pieces for extended periods of time and recording the sequential development of our observations); the particularity of individual perspective (we will discuss the subjective, improvisational aspects of critical writing as related to our own lives); and the work in context (we will look outward from the objects at hand to the economies and networks of circulation to which they belong, and consider how these economies and networks affect the objects' meaning). Our goal --demystifying criticism --will facilitate not just the creation of reviews and such critical-adjacent texts as artist's statements and institutional communication, but also the conceptual enrichment of our art and design practices themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THAD I: GLOBAL MODERNISMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a required course for all freshmen and transfer students to introduce them to global modern and contemporary art, architecture and design in the period between 1750 and the present. The course addresses modernism as a global project, presenting several case studies from across the world that unfold to show how multiple kinds of modernism developed in different times and distant places. By presenting alternate, sometimes contradictory stories about modern and contemporary art and design, along with a set of critical terms specific to these times and places, the class aims to foster a rich, complex understanding of the many narratives that works of art and design can tell. With this grounding, students will be well positioned to pursue their interests in specialized courses in subsequent semesters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Required for graduation for all undergraduates. There are no waivers for THAD-H101. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Attention transfers and upperclass students: Please register into one of the evening sections set aside for transfer and upperclass students if you have not completed this first-year graduation requirement. Email the Academic Programs Coordinator in the Liberal Arts Division office for assistance if needed. All other H101 sections are for freshmen. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will survey the emergence of an avant-garde in the United States during and after World War II.  The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO IRANIAN CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From international film festivals to university campuses, from museums of modern art to neighborhood theaters, Iranian cinema has now emerged as the staple of a cultural currency that defies the logic of nativism and challenges the problems of globalization. Hamid Dabashi writes this in the introduction to his landmark study of Iranian cinema, Close Up: Iranian Cinema, Past, Present and Future (Verso, 2001). This course introduces you to the history of Iranian cinema, from the Iranian New Wave (1960s) to the present. It examines the ways in it occupies an important place on the scene of global cinema while it "defies the logic of nativism." We will watch some of the most prominent movies by acclaimed Iranian filmmakers Dariush Mehrjui, Ebrahim Golestan, Nasser Taghvai, Amir Naderi, Sohrab Shahid-Saless, Forough Farrokhzad, Jafar Panahi, Masoud Kimiai, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Bahram Beyzaie, Rakhshan Bani-Etemad, Marzieh Meshkini, Asghar Farhadi, Tahmineh Milani, Ebrahim Hatamikia, and Kamran Shirdel. We will also look at the works of diasporic artists, including Shirin Neshat, Marjane Satrapi, Ramin Bahrani, Mitra Farahani, Ana Lily Amirpour, and Granaz Moussavi. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above.  &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND TRAUMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the discourse art and trauma. It beings with a history of trauma studies, with its roots in Holocaust studies, Freudian interpretation, and the discipline of Psychology. It ventures on to explore the ramifications of understanding trauma in the realm of imag(in)ing suffering, whether represented through journalism, popular media, or artistic representation. We will interrogate how the models posited by trauma theory hold up in the age of new media. A recurrent motif in the class will be what it means to study trauma and its representation, both abstractly and personally, ethically and psychosomatically, and establish practices for maintaining sustainable and responsible modes of inquiry.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HUMANITY OR NAH?: BLACKNESS, GENDER, RESISTANCE, AND MEMORY IN MONUMENTS, MAPS, AND ARCHIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to be a "deep-dive" into the liberatory archaeologies of racialized, gendered, and sexual memory(s) articulated by Xicanx, Latinx, Native American, and Africana scholars, artists, creatives, activists, and cultural workers that resist the epistemic regimes of antiblackness, colonialism, and white supremacy. Students have the opportunity to engage scholarly and artistic works that exemplify how Blackness rejects while simultaneously marking in many ways, the limits and logic of gender and sexuality, exposing the colonial underpinnings of "Man" and modern ideas of "human." This course focuses on monuments, maps, and archives as three distinct sites where antiblackness, colonialism, and white supremacy are both sanctioned and defied in the public sphere. Students will examine research from multiple scholars that troubles the assumption that becoming assimilated and included as "human" and "citizen" in the eyes of the State is progress for Black and Native communities. Using the Black Digital Humanities, students will demonstrate their comprehension and command of the thematic foundations of the course by creating their own narratives of memory and resistance via spatial visualization and/or auditory digital software.</COURSEDESC>

This class will examine various kinds of drawings from the history of art and visual culture moving chronologically from the medieval to the post-modern. Our studies will have a hands-on approach, meeting behind the scenes in the collections of the RISD Museum.  Working from objects directly will be supplemented by readings and writing assignments as well as active classroom discussion.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; This seminar is recommended for THAD concentrators and students especially interested in drawing. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We are so familiar with these three hot drinks but they became commodities and part of our everyday only recently. This course explores what values were attached to these plants before the era of industrialized production, i.e. before ca. 1800. We will survey how Westerners adopted these beverages by looking at medical theories, the issue of morality, and the expansion of sugar production. We will also study how the craving for these products reinforced or even spurred slavery in French, Dutch, and English colonies. Special attention is dedicated to how ritual behavior affects design in terms of the sociability around these beverages, required manners, and the tableware crafted for them. The methodology is based on the analysis of images, discussions of assigned readings, written responses, visits to museums (RISD and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston), and touring the facility of a chocolate artisan.</COURSEDESC>

The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the myth and cultural importance placed on spaces and objects occupied and used by the so-called "geniuses" of American history alongside our general romantic interest in "the genius" as a cultural phenomenon. We will examine the designed objects and spaces of famous American artists and heroes - places such as Graceland, Dollywood, and Marfa; objects like Thomas Jefferson's writing desk; and museums created out of the homes of Louisa May Alcott and Mark Twain, among others. In an attempt to unpack and understand the importance of objects in both memory- and identity-making, we will consider how visual and material objects both communicate personality and legacy and how they act as mediators between each "genius" and their audiences, allowing visitors to come into contact with the imaginative worlds of their heroes.    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EPISTEMOLOGIES OF (SELF)CARE: THEORIES AND PRACTICES OF CARING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a combination of theoretical inquiry into care and self-care as creative and intellectual methodology and a practical laboratory in which students can reflect on and cultivate the practices that support their work and integrity of well-being.  Audre Lorde's famous words - caring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare - carry fraught meaning in a moment wherein callousness and a lack of empathy seem to dictate political and social discourse. The theoretical aim of this class is to unpack the notion of caring, often constructed as an individual concern and practice which makes it vulnerable to neoliberal co-option, and its expression on a spectrum from Lorde's radical self-preservation to the empathetic relationship building necessary to maintain (often marginalized) communities. The practical aspects of this course encourage students to consider the different infrastructures that work to encourage self-care and mutual care, and to locate tools that support their artistic and scholarly practices. We will examine the notions of surviving, coping, and thriving, pointing not only to case studies in the literature, but examining how these themes appear in our personal experience. This class has an Academic Enrichment budget to enable an experiential module and as such, no more than 20 students can be accommodated. The waitlist will be strictly followed.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S FIELD JOURNAL: INDIGENOUS AMERICAN SPINNING, DYEING, AND WEAVING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course has two primary goals: cultivating an in-depth, hands-on knowledge of a topic in indigenous art history and developing a diverse set of writing tools for documenting lived experience.  First, this course will explore the history, anthropology, and overall context of the development of traditional indigenous American textile production methods.  Our examination of these textiles will involve critical readings of key texts, lectures and discussions.  However, above all, we will be employing a hands-on approach to reproduce the process involved in making these textiles.  Focusing on the specific example of Navajo blanket and rug weaving, together we will create our own woven tapestries, replicating traditional methods from cleaning wool straight off the sheep, to dyeing with natural dyes, to building and weaving on our own traditional-style Navajo tapestry looms. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;   The second goal of this course is to explore a variety of approaches toward documenting through writing students' own experiences in the field - ranging from more creative and artistic approaches to more formal or technical descriptions.  The intention is to expose students to a variety of writing methods that may come in handy in their professional careers, be they artists' statements or grant applications.  To this end, students will be keeping a semester-long field journal detailing their hands-on experiences in this course, culminating in the production of a final presentation of their work. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE MYTH OF THE CITY IN 19TH AND 20TH CENTURY WESTERN ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the role played by urban mythology in 19th and 20th - century European and American art. We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY ART SINCE 1960</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will trace major developments in contemporary art from the 1960s to the present. Beginning with the shift away from modernist abstraction in the late 1950s and proceeding chronologically, we will examine the diverse array of movements, practices, and events that have come to define the larger field of contemporary art: minimalism, conceptualism, and pop in the 1960s, site specific and performance art in the 1970s, the "culture wars" and postmodernist debates of the 1980s, and the various forms of "abject," project-based, and "relational" art that followed. Foregrounding problems that have remained central for artists throughout this period - the status of the body, the institutional conditions of artistic production and reception, the politics of representation and difference - we will focus on putting the shifting terrain of contemporary art into broad social, historical, and theoretical perspective. In turn, we will attempt to develop a comprehensive critical framework for understanding the aesthetic and political stakes of contemporary art today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class examines different methods of interpretation employed by art historians and art critics to "read" works of art. Each week we will focus on a particular methodological approach central to the production of art historical knowledge such as Formalism, Iconography, Psychoanalysis, Semiotics, Post-Structuralism, Museum Studies, Critical Theory, Queer Theory, Critical Race Theory, Affect Theory, and Postcolonial Theory. The course also looks into the history of the discipline itself by way of reading primary texts written by art historians and thinkers whose thoughts and writings, in one way or another, have shaped the discipline of art history. We will also consider responses from non-Western scholars to the predominantly Western narratives that are at the center of the field.</COURSEDESC>

Examinations will focus on the critical cultural and environmental circumstances which led to the development of distinctive architectural styles throughout the Americas.  Approached from an anthropological/archaeological perspective, specific topics of discussion will include the following: construction methods and material choices, spatial arrangements and use areas, the relationship between physical and social community structure, and architectural manifestation of cultural belief systems.  Emphasis will also be placed on manipulations of the landscape in response to social and climatic needs.  Architectural culture discussed in this course will range widely in scale, dispersal and geography - from the igloo of a small Inuit hunting party to the entire Mayan city of Chichen Itza, to the terrace and irrigation systems of the Inca.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN IN TURN OF THE CENTURY VIENNA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At the turn of the 19th to the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city in the world, a thriving multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic metropolis that rivaled Paris and London. While the Empire of Austro-Hungary eyed expansion toward the East and into the Balkans, its larger project was the development of a grand boulevard around Vienna's historic inner city to proclaim the magnificence of the Empire. On the municipal level, however, contemporary cultural movements such as socialism, feminism, and psychoanalysis and the influx of predominantly Jewish and East European refugees slowly permeated Vienna's urban culture and shifted orientation from the "high modernist" tendencies of the Viennese Secession and Austrian Expressionism toward movements such as the Vienna Workshops, a precursor to the Bauhaus in Germany. In this class, we will examine Viennese Art and Design from the erection of the Ringstrasse to the art and design of public spaces for the nation and its people such as the municipal housing projects of Red Vienna. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

After a brief examination of the archaeological evidence for such an event, this course will focus on the art and literature inspired by the Trojan War from Ancient Greece through modern times.  Readings will include selections from Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare, and take into account return stories such as the Odyssey.  Art with Trojan iconography will be explored from ancient vase-paintings and sculptures through Renaissance and Baroque depictions, up to a contemporary graphic novelization and a brief discussion of films on the subject.  Major themes include the interaction of art and literature, and the mutability of an established narrative at the hands of subsequent creators.</COURSEDESC>

A theme of the course will be the design theories and practices initiated at the German Bauhaus in the 1920s and their subsequent international spread and local adaptation, precipitated by war, exile, migration, globalization of industry and trade, and decolonization. Case studies may include Lazlo Moholy-Nagy at the New Bauhaus in Chicago, Anni Albers at Black Mountain College, the HfG Ulm and its collaboration with schools in Brazil and India, and the recently founded Bauhaus Institute at the China Academy of Art. Throughout, we will ask what happens when the idea of universal design is adapted to local politics, economies, and design cultures. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to sophomore and above.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CATHEDRALS AND CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cathedrals and Cities will consider the art and architecture of Western Europe between 1200-1500.  Two significant elements of this period are the architecture of the Gothic Cathedral, one of the most audacious types of building ever created, and the growth and development of cities where diverse groups of people mingled together in new urban environments. At the same time several monarchies in Europe, including France and England, were increasing in power and commissioning significant works of art and architecture.  There was an in important expansion of trade both within Europe and into sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.  This long-distance trade provided new access to materials such as ivory and silks that were used in luxury art objects desired by the growing aristocracy.   New currents of personal religious devotion and new religious orders such as the Franciscans and Dominicans fostered new types of manuscripts, such as Books of Hours, and new architectural forms such as private chapels.  New possibilities for gender roles occurred in devotion to the Virgin Mary, Christ's mother, and in new vernacular illuminated literature recounting courtly tales of love and adventure.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PARADES AND PROCESSIONS IN EARLY MODERN EUROPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In 1400-1800 Europe, processions were ubiquitous and frequent. A whole city or single parties would take to the streets, marching in unison for multiple reasons. Such collective actions were often part of rites of passage for royals (birth, marriage, coronation, or death) but also marked commoners' lives with funerals or carnival. They could commemorate a saint's feast day, stage relic transfers, or celebrate the visit of a ruler or a dignitary to a city (the so-called triumphant entries). This course explores the performative aspects of such events, from their logistics (preparations, space, timing) to the part played by art and design. How were bodies disciplined and groups kept together? What was carried along and to what physical or emotional effects? Questions of group identity emerge; the distinction of actors/spectators blurs; religion and politics interweave; and the senses dominate. We will decode images of such ephemeral spectacles in, notably, paintings, individual prints, and festive books; and analyze processional objects, whether extant or not, highlighting the importance of their materiality and symbolism. Embodied experience is planned through a series of theatre exercises.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Embodiment is a universal. How we construct our understandings of it is not. In this class we will investigate conceptions and depictions of the early-modern body (1400-1700) mainly in Europe with excursions to Africa, Brazil, China, Japan. Among our topics will be: understanding correspondences and the macrocosm, the classical body and its aesthetics of beauty; the grotesque; naked or nude?; criminal and saintly bodies, including the divine/mortal body of Christ; death, ritual and the macabre; physiognomy and the face; the science of sexuality and art of erotics; constructing genders; medicine, knowledge, and the culture of dissection; fragmentation and the resonance of body parts. We'll analyze historical materials with an eye for current practices in bodily identities, such as gender fluidity, body enhancement and performance, body as machine. And, we'll make frequent use of RISD's art collection.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Open to undergraduates sophomore and above. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will examine the roles and responsibilities of non-profit arts organizations from both a practical and ideological perspective to relate them to one's own artistic or design practice or professional aspirations. The course will visit regional arts non-profits, examining their life cycles and the factors that shape an agency's success and/or failure. Organizations investigated may include: arts councils, service organizations, arts centers, alternative spaces, residency programs, community-based initiatives, foundations, and galleries. A deepening understanding of non-profits arts management including mission and vision, leadership, sustainability, relationships to the community and the public will occur. We will ask whom do they serve, what is their relevancy, and what qualitative results do they achieve? The off-campus visits and on-campus guests will serve as core information to researching and proposing a start-up non-profit, analyzing non-profits, or developing successful residency applications. This course will be of special interest to studio practitioners and educators whose professional lives are likely to intersect with arts organizations and agencies in the future.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Department of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design requires MA candidates submit a capstone thesis in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Candidates are given a degree of flexibility in determining the format for this work, but typically it takes the form of either a thesis monograph essay or a thesis book. The thesis monograph essay provides candidates with the opportunity to focus on a deep investigation of a single subject framed within the context of learning and through art and design. An essential characteristic of this approach to the thesis is in how it provides evidence of the candidate's ability to move beyond description to analysis and how they are able to place the subject of investigation within the realm of scholarship. The thesis book provides a candidate with the opportunity to make sense of their journey through their program in a more autobiographical and documentary manner. The thesis book format affords candidates the opportunity to explore how form can be exploited to visualize research. Whether presented as a thesis monograph essay or thesis book, this capstone requirement provides MA candidates with a formal opportunity to make public their understanding about a specific aspect of the nature of arts learning gained through their coursework, excursions into the scholarly literature and fieldwork experiences. The purpose here, therefore, is to conceive of the thesis not merely as an academic exercise but also contributing to program development as well as providing a reservoir of understandings that will inform the candidate's future professional practice as an educator.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The place, product and systems design problems and exercises in this fall studio-based workshop build on the documentation design tools developed during the summer design course TLAD-654G Design Education Workshop I.  The sequence of courses have been developed in tandem specifically to expand the repertoire of K-12 educators' curriculum toolkits to include design. Further, this course provides educators with an invaluable foundation with which to engage in STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Math) teaching.   This course, with an emphasis on place, product and system, introduces design principles as tools for creative problem solving and making as related to the physical world we inhabit.  In this course, students experiment with materials, work at the scale of the body, with spaces of enclosure and gathering, and with complex built and natural environmental systems.  The goal is to work as a designer, using design principles and methodologies as a way to explore the world in which we live and to experiment with materials in ways that address everyday problems. In working through the course design problems, students are introduced to design tools and materials for observation, iteration, prototyping and documenting user experience to solve design problems. Throughout the course, students adapt newly introduced design methods to curriculum proposals for design teaching and learning elementary and secondary school settings.  &lt;B&gt; The combined set of design toolkits developed through the summer and fall design education studio workshops will assist educators form the foundation for a design pedagogy to be carried forward into their K-12 art and design teaching.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for MAT &lt;BR&gt;Open to non-major graduate students by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In this manner, this pair of courses provides graduate students with an essential foundation to teaching the Visual Arts (art and design) from pre-K to 12th grade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for students in grades 7-12 that aligns with the National Visual Arts Standards (NVAS). The course is guided by the belief all middle and high school students have creative capacity and that visual arts education plays an extraordinarily important role in its development.  Further, the course places emphasis on instructional design that encourages curiosity, discovery, creativity and importantly personal point of view.  Throughout the course, there is a focus on curriculum development and pedagogical strategies crafted to meet the cognitive and social development of learners as well as the personal interests of students while simultaneously introducing the work of a diverse range artists from historic to contemporary as models of practice.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design education that is informed by the graduate student's personal artistic practice combined with their understanding of the rich diversity of human visual expression. The course places special emphasis on the development of studio-based learning that centers on the intersecting domains of making and responding.  In this way, curriculum and instruction is designed to deepen secondary students' (7-12) understanding of art and design as expression of enduring ideas. Graduate students examine these concepts through their own studio practice, critical readings, the development curriculum maps and lesson plans and through an integrated practicum experience that provides an authentic opportunity to implement instruction with high school students in the TLAD-Studio Lab.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Major requirement for MAT, MA elecitve; MAT &amp; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Major topics of investigation include: varying curricular shifts in visual arts education, standards and accountability, the diverse classroom, political mandates, public school re-design, and the role of unions and professional associations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for MAT, MA elective; MAT &amp; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: MARKING AND MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media, yet drawing can be independent of all other media. How can we make our drawing ventures resonant or challenging? Through independent studio production and focused critique, the course provides graduate students from any major the opportunity to more deeply understand the nature of drawing through a series of self-directed and self-paced experiences and investigations. Coursework may be referenced or supported by historical and contemporary contexts. Digital works, a single drawing medium or tool, phenomenal means, or other materials or mixtures of instruments can be used for mark-making. A full spectrum of drawing ways and ideas can be explored. The class is structured around cross-major conversations in small group critiques, peer-exchange critiques, larger group reviews and individual analysis. Drawings from this course may integrate or extend other areas of graduate students' study, including thesis content and personal visual inquiries. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;MA elective &lt;BR&gt; Open to non-major graduate students as an elective. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTIST &amp; DESIGNER AS TEACHER: SCHOOL, MUSEUM, COMMUNITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides students from any major with the opportunity to explore issues in art and design teaching. As a broad overview, this course will address formal and informal art teaching in K-12 school-based settings, as well as in art museums, and community-based settings. Students will be introduced to ideas about teaching and learning art through a wide variety of experiences, such as observations in diverse art education settings, guest speakers, as well as opportunities interacting with (and teaching!) children and/or adolescents. This course will include seminar sessions, as well as site visits to local schools, museums, and community-based organizations. The content and experiences offered during this class hope to inspire and excite students about the possibilities of utilizing their studio practice as art &amp; design teachers or teaching artists in museum or community-based settings. The course will have particular value  to students perhaps considering continuing their studies at RISD beyond undergrad to pursue either a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) or Master of Arts (MA) in Art + Design Education.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This course is designed to introduce students to contemporary issues and practices in art education through a variety of spaces. The course content will be divided approximately into three distinct explorations: art and design teaching at the K-12 schools, art museum education, and community-based art teaching. During each exploration, students will be asked to reflect on their own personal experiences with art learning, as well as engage with readings that explore contemporary perspectives on art education. Additionally, each exploration will be enhanced with opportunities for students to experience authentic art education spaces (either digitally or in person) to see how theory can connect with practice. The course culminates in a capstone experience in which students, collaborating in small groups, will lead a short studio-based experience for children or adolescents. This experience will be conducted in partnership with a local education organization such as a school, community arts center or RISD's Project Open Door. Throughout this class, students will be offered a variety of opportunities to connect art education theory and practice, as well as reflect on their own experiences with art learning and teaching.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROFESSIONAL INTERNSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides MA students with the unique opportunity to complete a professional practice internship in a real world setting. The internship has a number of purposes but is particularly designed to expand the candidate's experience of arts-related programming in one of a number of venues including but not limited to: community arts centers, alternative arts spaces, foundations, museums, schools, hospitals, arts agencies, etc. An internship site is made in consultation with TLAD's Department Head who is in a particularly strong position to advise and recommend potential local and regional sites that might be an appropriate fit for a candidate. MA candidates are also encouraged to identify potential internship sites and the Department is very willing to make an institutional advance to an individual or organization in order to facilitate and establish an internship agreement. It is important for candidates to recognize that while they might wish to have a very particular internship, the ultimate placement is very much dependent upon the readiness of a particular site to accept an intern. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Major elective for MA; MA only. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
