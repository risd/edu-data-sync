   <COURSETITLE>SET DESIGN STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The class seeks to examine set design within a studio environment that is as close as possible to that of the profession, allowing students the opportunity to work on numerous productions in the design roles within theatre and opera.  Relevance will be attached to the exploration of visual solutions that are viscerally grounded in the text.  Script analysis will be thorough and ongoing.  Group participation in this process is essential.  Students will be expected to read and research one to two plays per week.  All sets will be modeled, with fluctuating levels of completion.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Architecture &amp; Design Majors Only&lt;BR&gt; Class meets off-campus at Brown University, 50 John Street Studio&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DSGN+ENTREPRENURIAL THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Entrepreneurship--the imagining, building and sustaining of socially impactful organizations--is a creative art. It requires insights and knowledge from the humanities and the social and physical sciences, and demands self-awareness and purpose. The premise of this lecture course is that designers and artists are uniquely gifted with critical entrepreneurial qualities. This course will allow students to better understand how and where their skills and perspectives fit into the world of entrepreneurship and business. The objective of Design and Entrepreneurial Thinking is for students to understand a basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities. This course seeks to educate students to recognize business as a critical design factor--a defining constraint or liberating perspective-along the same lines that other design principles are taught. This course will use Harvard Business School case notes, case studies, and recent  business books to highlight this thinking. Students will be introduced to basic business concepts through lectures, case studies, assignments and class discussion. Homework assignments will work off the classroom pedagogy. Topics covered will be business models, marketing, finance, and strategy. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO BASIC SHOEMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Apparel majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ID 2494 for ID majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students of each discipline will travel to galleries, studios and factories in Turin, Milan, and Florence, learning traditional and hi-tech design processes that apply to Shoe Design.  The goal of the course is for students to practice techniques of shoe design as a product that exists midway between the realms of Apparel and Industrial Design.  They will also experience the intersection of creative perspectives and approaches from each discipline.  The rich design culture of Italy, and Da Vinci's seven principles of creativity, will serve as inspiration and guide.  Each student will actively explore their observations and nurture their evolving design process through journaling and interactive dialogue.  Students work will be professionally photographed, and the course will conclude at RISD with a final Exhibition/Crit. Note:  The course will spend the first and last weeks at RISD, with the other 3 weeks spent throughout Northern Italy.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required&lt;br&gt; Estimated travel cost: $4,388.00, airfare not included.&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ID-3052.

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture Department;  Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course reviews the role of metals in architecture, focusing on the fundamentals of steel analysis and design in architecture;  and examines typical framing techniques and systems. Topics  include construction issues, floor framing systems, column analysis  and design, steel detailing and light gauge steel framing materials and systems.  In addition the course introduces students to lateral force  resistance systems in steel construction and exposes them to alternatives to steel such as aluminum and fiberglass. By the and of the course,  students will be aware of the role of metals in architectural design and construction; design and detail simple steel structural systems; and proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The study of basic concepts of Human Environmental Comforts. Inherent within 'physio-environ' considerations are principles of temperature, humidity, heat transfer, air movement, and hydrostatics. These principles will be studied in terms of their abstract physics and mathematics, through empirical benchmarking and as the basis for a design proposal that includes considerations of larger scale strategies as well as assemblies. Emphasis will be placed on the principles behind the technology, the behavioral characteristics and the qualities of the systems' operation considered in making building design decisions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department.&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OUTSIDE THE GUIDELINES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This interdisciplinary workshop is understood primarily as a protected time and space within the Architecture Department for an improvisational investigation of space. It will be taught from year to year by a faculty from a rotating team of architects, visual artists, dancers, scientists, etc. who have invested their life's work in the medium of space. Questions regarding spatial phenomena, scale, place  etc., will be addressed through the language that the visiting faculty's work employs: it could be a material language for an artist,a tectonic language for an architect, a language of movement for a dancer, mathematical for a scientist, or musical for a musician. The presumption is that there is a unique learning experience when  students are asking questions not of their teacher, but with them; and that the individual faculty's discipline and nature can influence the  content and improvisational development of each iteration of this workshop.&lt;BR&gt;   All participants are invited to challenge what they think they know, to expand their language of practice, to extend their understanding of  space beyond the culture, practices and lens of their own disciplines,to inquire by doing and to engage the purpose that the visiting faculty brings.&lt;BR&gt;   Please contact the Architecture Department to learn more about this year's iteration of this course including information on the visiting  faculty who will be teaching it.&lt;BR&gt;       This workshop course provides an opportunity for the exploration of spatial concepts through observation and experience of phenomena. Using the infrastructure and environment of Providence as a laboratory, we will investigate how the ordinary can be transformed into the extraordinary and how the invisible can be rendered visible. Memory, time, light, vibration and metaphor will be examined in relation to the experience of architecture, installation and event. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students' participation and individual interests will shape the direction of the workshop. The idea is to investigate and invent, pushing the parameters of what is known by applying new ideas and materials. An ongoing series of experimental drawings, constructions and installation projects will be reinforced by discussions and selected readings. The semester will be punctuated with multimedia presentations and site visits. Instruction will be individualized, with an emphasis on group critiques. Guest speakers will share their work and challenge the process. Visiting critics will participate in final reviews. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The course begins with individual projects and will encourage collaboration. Site-specific, ephemeral installations will focus on magnifying a sense of place and present.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Students will record the environmental stimuli that inform our experience of place and time; Identify conditions, influences, and social forces that influence our built environment; consider spectacle, surprise and wonder as artistic devices; question your own aesthetics and instincts; engage in the work of significant figures in contemporary architecture and art; and develop critical skills that support and encourage the learning process.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CODING ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar addresses ideas, theories, and practices relating to computation in architecture and design. The course begins with the roots of computation long before the "personal computer" was conceived. The emphasis then shifts toward the present and a study of the canonical written contributions by design computation theorists and researchers (Knight, McCullough, Mitchell, Negroponte, Stiny, and others) as well related architectural, artistic, philosophical, and epistemological positions (Dewey, Evans, Klee, Lynn, Petherbridge, Schon, and others). In addition to reading and writing, the course is peppered with computational instruction so that students can confront and explore computation as makers as well as theorists. The seminar oscillates between reading/writing one week, then projecting the following week. Reading/writing weeks task students with a close reading of two texts and the composition of a written, critical, and analytic response. Project weeks follow, and call upon students to conceive, execute, and document a related experiment, prototype, or work of art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Junior and above&lt;br&gt; Major elective,open to non-majors and Brown students by permission&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WOOD STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will review the fundamentals of wood in architecture with a focus on wood materials and construction systems and lumber and timber structural analysis and design.  Work includes timber systems consisting of conventional framing trusses, laminates, built-up sections and connections. In addition, this course will review the principles of structural loads; gravity, lateral, live and dead.  The concept of lateral resistance through standard wood framing systems will be explored. Manufactured lumber has become a major part of today's wood construction industry and the design and detailing of these materials will be explored in depth. By the end of the course, students will be aware of the role of wood materials in architectural design and construction and be able to design and detail simple Lumber and Timber structural systems.  They will be able to proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis.   This course will provide the student with a good understanding of the material and the common structural and architectural systems used in today's practice.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Requirement: ARCH majors only.&lt;br&gt; Registration by the Architecture Department.&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The analysis and design  includes concrete structures, reinforced and pre-stressed concrete members, concrete foundations and reinforced  masonry. The student will  proportion concrete and masonry  structures using ultimate strength design.  The longer class time on  Tuesday  allows students to design, make a concrete mix and create a concrete object.  By the end of the course, the students will be  able to design and detail simple concrete and masonry systems such as footings, basement walls, beams and slabs; proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis; develop an understanding of proper detailing of architectural  concrete and masonry veneers by understanding thermal movements,  waterproofing, and construction techniques. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department. &lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will research and discuss a variety of materials, their physical properties and their applications. Using furniture as our vehicle, we will explore how these materials might be utilized, beyond their original intent. We will also examine how the manipulation of these materials can create new ideas in furniture.  In the first half of the course students will research, view, handle, and discuss a variety of materials. In the second half, students will model and construct, either a 1/4 scale model, or a full scale detail of a piece of furniture using a material selected from the research done in the first half of the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Serious research and a specific preparation begins in this course, forming the theoretical basis for the creative development of the Degree Project (Spring, 6 credits). This is a period in which the nature of the work is clarified, a process is developed, possibilities are examined, and research and information gathering completed.  The research from this course acts as an armature, establishing the attitude, objectives, and significance of the thesis as an exploration of architectural ideas, and forming the underpinnings for the work of the coming semester.  The result of this effort, begun in the fall with DP prep and completed in the spring, is gathered together and reflected in the DP Book as part of the requirements for completion of Degree Project. The work is reviewed at the end of Wintersession; satisfactory completion of this course is a prerequisite for the Degree Project in the Spring semester.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department; course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Schedule to be determined with Advisor&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How can timeless human activities such as drawing and painting, relegated to the realm of the analogue, meaningfully engage 3D modeling platforms like Rhino/Grasshopper and contemporary output methods such as 3D printing? How can we learn to intuit in the realm of the virtual and what are the boundaries of this experience? This course will allow new ways of "seeing" and "feeling" and use a computational framework in the design process. Rather than take a conventional approach based on the technical aspects of a specific software program, students will be exposed to a rich diversity of potential work flows. The goal of this course is enhancing personal craft and technique through these digital tools while exploring new potential approaches to advanced technology. The explanation of textile structures and the architecture of cloth will serve as a starting point for ideas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Estimated Material Cost: TBD (base on Model Shop Fee Structure) &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as TEXT-4705.

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPIC IN ARCHITECTURAL DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on drawing topics pertaining to architecture. Drawing is treated as a space for architectural research and/or as an autonomous work of architecture. The notion that drawing serves architecture merely as representation is questioned and critiqued. The theoretical and technical focus on the process of drawing will cultivate and address issues that have for hundreds of years served as the core of the architecture discipline. Simultaneously, the research may allow for the generation or assimilation of ideas, cultures and knowledge from other fields into architecture. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED TOPICS IN ARCHITECTURE DESIGN AND COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 3 credit advanced seminar offers students the opportunity to focus on computational topics pertaining to architecture. Computational techniques and computational ideas are explored through making, writing, reading, and discussion. Some of the work in this course will take place in the space of the digital model, but coding, physical computation, and human computation may also enter into play. Students in this course will, under the mentorship of faculty, develop a level of expertise and knowledge that goes beyond what is usually associated with the requisite skills for contemporary architectural practice. Conversely, it is expected that computation may provoke a challenge to even the most base conceptions of design and architecture. Each iteration of this course will identify and advance a single theme, concept or problem. Some issues that may arise during this course include authorship, modeling vs simulation, computer controlled fabrication, intelligence, and creativity. Prerequisite: completion of Architectural Projection or permission of instructor with a demonstrated experience with 2-D and 3-D software.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major elective &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GALAPAGOS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Inspired by the Galapagos Archipelago and the knowledge transformations brought about as a consequence of Darwin's five-week experience within their dense biodiversity, the seminar will emerge from the first principle of the theory of evolution: When individual agents are brought into proximity they interact, building new linkages, under the right circumstances these interactions create transformation, developing new forms. The proximity and interaction of a great diversity of agency is fundamental to the emergence of new forms; knowledge evolves, comprehension evolves, new forms emerge. Recognizing these diverse forms of agency as a diversity of 'ways of knowing' brought in to close proximity, we begin to understand a living system of knowledge transformation.   &lt;BR&gt; The structure of the seminar is situated between the questions of artifice and theatricality within the urban condition and the collective embodied process of constructing dynamic actions and interactions within the City of Providence. &lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00 - $50.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to juniors and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From altering ready-made ceramic objects with your own digitally printed decals to learning how to make ceramic objects of your own design using basic wheel-throwing, hand-building and slip-casting techniques, we will explore tableware from formal to informal-historic to contemporary. This course is designed to introduce utilitarian ceramics as a medium to majors in other disciplines as well as challenge ceramics majors in their own medium. The course emphasis is hands-on projects using both traditional and non-traditional ceramic techniques. Additionally there will be assigned readings, lectures and independent research projects. Work is regularly reviewed in individual and group critiques. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective for Ceramic majors&lt;BR&gt; Available to nonmajors with department permission required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: CERAMICS AND CONTEPLATIVE PRACTICE IN JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This interdisciplinary studio-based course aims to deepen students' awareness and understanding of Japanese culture through a joint exploration of traditional ceramic techniques and contemplative practice while traveling and working in the Kansai region of Japan. Contemplative practices such as Zen meditation have influenced many uniquely Japanese cultural institutions, including tea ceremony and its ceramic wares, shodo and haiku. With an eye towards this relationship, this course will utilize daily meditation practice in tandem with a selection of related exercises as a complementary framework for studio investigations in clay. Engaging with such practices through both participatory and critical approaches, students will access a more integrated understanding of the culture in which they are immersed for the duration of the course. More broadly, they will develop an experiential awareness of the link between contemplative traditions and creative process.  &lt;BR&gt; Weekdays will be comprised of demonstrations and active work time at Kurumaki Studio in rural Nara Prefecture, Japan, where students will develop an understanding of fundamental ceramic techniques using the exceptional local clays. In the final week of the course, students will participate in the collaborative process of firing the resulting pieces in the anagama kiln using traditional wood-firing methods. Weekends will offer opportunities for venturing further afield to visit significant historical, architectural and cultural sites, with scheduled travel to Nara, Osaka, Kyoto and Naoshima.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $4101.00, airfare not included. &lt;br&gt; ***Off-campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the impact of computer based 3d modeling, with special attention to the history of illusionistic representation on the one hand, and generative and algorithmic approaches to form on the other.&lt;BR&gt; How have special effects, video games, architectural renderings, or simulations such as Google Earth changed the way we engage space, or are they simply a continuation of perspectival illusions created in the Renaissance? How can artists and designers use or hack these digital mediums in their own work? How do algorithmic approaches to form differ from mimetic or illusionistic approaches to form? &lt;BR&gt; The course will look at various 3d modeling techniques as well as different methods of outputting or presenting 3D models, including rendering images, creating animations, or using fabrication techniques such as lasercutters and rp machines to produce physical models. The main goal of the course is to help students develop a working methodology for integrating 3d modeling into their own practice. The course will not focus on any single software, but will examine a wide range of media and computer software that can be used or hacked by students, from Google Earth, to video game engines, and from xtranormal.com to Maya and 3ds Max, from simple tools to scripting and programming 3d form. The course is open to both beginners and students with experience in 3D modeling&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; graduate level&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required &lt;br&gt; Open to senior, fifth-year, space permitting. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course supports the exploration of theoretical, social, material, technical and contextual research and concerns in new media arts practice during the first year of the first year of the D + M MFA program. It is a combined studio and seminar forum for Digital + Media first-year students. Participants become familiar with a vocabulary of multiple practices within digital media and, through a rigorous, hands-on approach, develop a thorough understanding of computational media as it applies to her/his individual creative practice. Students are introduced to a core set of methodologies and technologies from basic electronics and programming to interaction design to installation, and are encouraged to break comfort zones and practice through experimentation. Students conceptualize and discuss their studio-based work and their ongoing practice. Readings in critical cultural theory, media art theory, philosophy, semiotics and other areas further ground the conceptual approach of students in the Digital + Media department. The course is a mix of individual meetings, a required lecture and workshop series and group critiques. Some guest lecturers and visiting critics may also become involved with this class in terms of critical/research aspects. With a focus on studio experimentation and production, students will conceptualize and discuss their works-in-progress while beginning to work with new materials and systems in combination with a broad range media. Each student will practice articulating their ongoing studio art process and work, and will contribute to the dialogue concerning the research and work of their classmates.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this historical survey, we analyze the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. We examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged. We make connections across decades by focusing on the recurring themes of language, futurism, simulation, hyper-reality, transnationality and information.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

It is a combined studio and seminar forum for Digital + Media second-year students. Students conceptualize and discuss their studio-based work and their ongoing practice as they begin the thesis process. Working artist bibliographies are developed - both projects and texts. Readings in critical cultural theory, media art theory, philosophy, semiotics and other areas further support the contextualization and grounding of the innovative practical and conceptual approaches of students in the Digital + Media department. The course is a mix of individual meetings, an optional lecture and workshop series and group critiques. Guest lecturers and visiting critics may also become involved with this class in terms of critical/research aspects. Each student will practice articulating their art process and work towards thesis, and will contribute to the dialogue concerning the research and work of their classmates.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Major requirement: Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MEDIA THESIS PREP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In  "On Permission to Write", essayist Cynthia Ozick distinguishes between the "good-citizen writer" and the "shaman-writer"  The first, she says, writes dutifully; the second, "obsessively", "torrentially", and most crucially, with self-given permission. For artists and designers who have, by and large, favored visual over written expression, obsession and torrent probably come more naturally in the studio than on the page. This course seeks to bring that same uninhibited, exploratory, and illuminating sensibility to the thesis, to suggest that writing is not a duty, but rather can be integral to studio practice. We will look at writing about one's work -- its art-historical, theoretical, and personal sources; its form and process; its motivation; its interpretation -- as a kind of translation from form to language (one that can be as individual and authentic as our chosen materials). The course will include writing exercises designed to help us think more deeply and coherently about our work and ideas, as well as discussion of assigned readings. The readings are exclusively written by artists and designers: criticism, manifestos, journal writings, and artist interviews - a selection intended to suggest that in permitting themselves to write, artists and designers establish artistic agency, lineage, and history itself through that writing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graduate major requirement, Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to second-year graduates&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHYSICAL COMPUTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Physical Computing is an introduction to low-level electronic technologies such as sensors, microcontrollers, display technologies and motors. We will review the basics of electricity and microcontrollers (one-chip computers). A wide range of sensors, and output technologies will be presented, and demonstrated so that students have a sense of currently available low-cost technologies that are available for artwork and their course work.  &lt;br&gt; The hardware on which the course will be based is low-cost wireless microcontroller modules and a basic array of sensors and interface tech. The modules can be used to record data from the body wirelessly, or to harvest user information from a gallery installation. The modules can also be used to drive output systems, such as displays, sound, or motors. Students will also be expected to pursue technology that interests them including specialized sensors and output devices.  &lt;br&gt; If there is class interest and time we can construct our own printed circuit boards, to show students how to "close the loop" between the roles of consumers and constructors of hardware based electronic systems.  &lt;br&gt;  Readings and discussions will interrogate some of the latest tech industry jargon such as the "Internet of Things" and the place that robots and automation might have in the future, as well as writings by artists working with technology. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; graduate level&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, fifth-year, space permitting. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL + MEDIA THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As critical phenomenology, the aim of this course is to influence two acts, how to see and how to critique digital media, as extension of unresolved conceptual and aesthetic problems and as catapult for entirely original practice and possibility. The approach is the 'theoretical crit' that students write each week in response to readings, methods, problems, and works closely explored. As in contemporary art, new media's objects and theories are becoming increasingly interdependent. Thus, rather than using theory to evaluate artwork, we examine both work and theory, coming to contemporary, formal, critical, and instrumental voice through which to respond to assumptions and aspirations of each.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In addition to teaching basic software coding skills from the ground up, the course will focus on the social and historical backgrounds of these technologies and how they shape the growth of media, identity, politics and the everyday. Related works from the contemporary art and design fields will be examined, ranging from visual, performance and sound art to architecture, product design and beyond. Students will be expected to engage with computer coding and related technologies conceptually or technically in their studio work. &lt;BR&gt; The course will consist of introductory exercises in computer programming, discussions of articles related to contemporary digital media, frequent critiques, and an intensive final project that pushes the boundaries of computer coding as a creative tool. Mistakes, pitfalls and frustrations will be expected and encouraged as students navigate this quickly changing medium. No prior programming experience is necessary. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this interdisciplinary design/research laboratory, students will explore image-making technologies across a range of media. Each week, students will be introduced to a new material, tool or technique, from which they will investigate and contrive their own imaging experiment. Each experiment will be used to evaluate the process by which it is derived, a pattern aimed at helping students evolve key insights while developing systematic approaches for creative investigation. From early chemical procedures to advanced high-speed cameras and gigapixel photographs, to 3D scanning and depth-imaging techniques, to code-based camera systems controlled by sensors, to custom-built robotics and aerial drones, this lab will treat each process as a unique visual investigation. The extent of the class is to acquire creative-imaging workflows that serve within the larger context of a professional design or arts-based practice. Some background in either graphic design or photography, physical-computing and/or computer programming is helpful but not required. &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCREEN/WALL/CANVAS/FIELD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will investigate notions of surface as material ground for projected light/images, as visual, sensory and cognitive zones of expanded space, and as landscape for actual and psychogeographic exploration. &lt;br&gt; By exploring the sites of wall/canvas/screen/field as locations where materials, surfaces and contexts combine, we will see how architecture, film/video, digital media, textiles, painting, land art, sculpture and fashion, are mediated by surface relations. In our contemporary context, these relations often fuse together, pass through, or bounce off each other, and so accrue as layered complexities of space and materiality, which, in the words of Guiliana Bruno, operate as 1"mediated transfers of states of mid, feelings, and moods unfolding between persons across surface space." &lt;br&gt; These concepts will be introduced through readings, lectures and studio projects. Students will be encouraged to bring their own work into the conversation and re/consider it through class discussion around these topics, so as to develop and challenge their current practice. &lt;br&gt; This course is inspired by Guiliana Bruno 2014 book "Surface: Aesthetics, Materiality &amp; Media" which will be a core text. &lt;br&gt; We will consider works by the following (amongst others): Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Tacita Dean, Anthony McCall, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Luis Barragan, Isaac Julien, Wong Kar-wai, Sophie Tottie, Krzystof Wodiczko, Tara Donovan, Sarah Oppenheimer, Robert Wilson, The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI), Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Maya Lin, Brian Tolle, and Gordon Matta-Clark.  &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;  Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE: THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $25.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as LAEL-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

   <COURSEDESC>In the Directing class, students are encouraged to go beyond the first instinct or idea, and to develop a project to its fullest potential, particularly with respect to meaning and to potential modes of execution. Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DADA TODAY: 100 YEARS OF RADICAL PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Who could not be for Dada?  To know about Dada is to think "I have wasted my life." To know Dada is to shout "I am alive!"  There are many Dadas. In Berlin, New York, Paris, Hannover, Cologne, in pockets throughout Europe, Japan and Russia.  This course focuses on Zurich Dada, in the early months of 1916 when the city was packed with exiles and refugees rushing to and from war--including Vladimir Lenin, just arrived and James Joyce, engaged in pursuing production of his own play Exiles; and when German poet performers Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings opened the first Cabaret Voltaire.  If you would think it worth diving into a clash of noise, color and dynamic action in a rented hall with works by Hans Arp, Sophie Tuber, Marcel Janco, Marinetti, Modigliani, Picasso on the walls, new publications by Apollinaire, Cendrars, Kandinsky on offer, and performances by Tristan Tzara, Richard Huelsenbeck, Hennings, Ball with all or some of the above, then you might have enjoyed this international Cabaret.  From its first sounding, the pulse of Dada transmitted far, wide, and deep, through Surrealism, Lettrism, Situationism, Fluxus, Pop, Punk, to Ryan Trecartin / LIzzie Fitch.  But Dada is dead, right?  This course examines the corpse and makes new life rise from it, guided by two old teachers.  Students will look at our school, our society, our world, in the light of Dada: Has this humiliating age succeeded in winning our respect?  Works produced will include a research paper, individual and collaborative videos interpreting, adapting, conversing with and inventing from Zurich Dada, and a Virtual Cabaret.  Students will learn basic camera and production techniques, and approaches to filming performance including documentation, choreography, real time vs edited time, and design for live action and the camera.  The conversation may close by looping back to Zurich where the centennial of the first Cabaret Voltaire will be celebrated during the semester of our course.  This course will be supported by a visiting artist/designers from theatre and opera, and by visiting scholars. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Deposit: $150.00  &lt;br&gt;   Estimated Materials Cost: 100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Intro Film explores techniques of live action 16MM film production using Bolex cameras and flatbed editing tables. Technical concerns such as exposure, focus, depth of field, and basic editing conventions are covered. Aesthetic concerns such as composition, movement, editing rhythms, and the filmmaker's intention are discussed and critiqued. Students complete three individual assignments outside of class, and four in-class exercises in pairs or groups. The individual assignments encourage creative use of editing techniques such as traditional match-cutting, graphic match-cutting, and cross-cutting or parallel editing. The first individual project is silent, but for those that follow, students create soundtracks using elements such as effects, music, ambient sound, and voiceover.  Screenings in class include student rushes, works in progress, and finished films. In addition, a variety of short films are screened and discussed that relate to many of the techniques and aesthetic considerations explored throughout the semester.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $220.00  Deposit: $150.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by FAV department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required for nonmajors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Using a range of materials, students structure space through the manipulation of formal compositional elements. Within abstract and representational work, the character of lines, tones, and marks are studied as inseparable from the concept and content of drawings. Students are challenged to see their drawings as independent entities that must exist apart from references. Drawing embodies a connection to a rich tradition as well as a contemporary response to the world.</COURSEDESC>

Using various forms of expression and media, from traditional to digital methods, students investigate the complexities of meaning as affected by placement, narrative, and motion. The design process, - from research to development to execution - is guided through inquiry and exploration.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing is studied as a flexible, generative process that engages and challenges historical conventions. Using a range of materials, students structure space through the manipulation of formal compositional elements. Within abstract and representational work, the character of lines, tones, and marks are studied as inseparable from the concept and content of drawings. Students are challenged to see their drawings as independent entities that must exist apart from references. Drawing embodies a connection to a rich tradition as well as a contemporary response to the world.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*TURKEY: MAPPING ISTANBUL: PEOPLE OBJECTS, IMAGES, SPACE AND TIME: STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course and its co-requisite (LAEL-1518-01)introduces students to patterns and connections in the social life and material culture of Istanbul - from past to present - through artifacts, architecture, design, environments, literature, people and spaces. The cross-disciplinary nature of this Studio + Liberal Arts course offers rigorous visual, critical and experimental inquiry focused in a historical and cultural framework with the benefit of site-specificity. Input and participation from students of ALL levels of the college and from ALL departments are desired.  	 &lt;br&gt; For more than three millennia, the city of Istanbul has been a crossroad from East to West, North to South, and old to new. Although its strategic location straddling Europe and Asia has resulted in historic (and contemporary) conflicts between differing political, religious and economic interests, the ability of the citizens to absorb and adapt has allowed them to endure, resulting in a rich synthesis of ideologies, styles and practices. We will witness these layers of civilization through materials, structures and spaces and social situations that reveal transitions throughout Istanbul's history. As such, the city will be our laboratory for observing how humans continue to interact with places, things and ideas while providing an invaluable context for art, design, technology and social theorizing.  	 &lt;br&gt; Following an aggressive schedule that will fuse studio practices and research components, this course includes lectures, readings, discussions and studio activity combined with extensive foot, bus, and ferry navigation of the many neighborhoods of Istanbul. A final studio-based project that grows from sketchbook, journal and other recorded observations will be executed in conjunction with a written, research component. Both elements of the final project will be considered for relevancy, cohesiveness and contextualization of the student's research topic.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Costs: 3,700.00 - $4,500.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Corequisite: LAEL-1518 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students explore the structure and grammar of three-dimensional space using hands-on methods. We investigate the symmetries and transformations of polyhedra by constructing and deconstructing study models.  Stability, mobility, tensegrity, and dome structures are evaluated, and students are encouraged to apply the principles learned to architectural and sculptural designs.  Students experiment with pencils, paper, compasses, straight edges, scissors, exacto-knives, sticks, and joints, to discover concepts before they are named.  Fundamental principles of organization are emphasized and rote memorization of definitions discouraged.  The course will stress method, experiments, and risk taking.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FIGURE MODELING MARATHON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This intensive studio is based on the premise that study is an abstractive process. We will begin at a very basic level to define features of this process with exercises in form and small studies of posed models.  We'll use oil-based "Clean Clay", first unsupported, then over armatures, and gradually work up to 7/8 scale for portraits and 1/2 scale for figures.  While the yield will be three well-resolved portraits and two figures, both studied and invented, our underlying goal is the development of form consciousness, a notion of what organic form is, the idea of its integrity.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; To handle the spatial reckoning rigors of this class, students must possess solid drawing skills. They must have earned a grade of B or better in Foundation Drawing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; The 6-credit class meets four days a week, Monday-Thursday, 1-6pm, for six weeks.  Students must be prepared to dedicate Friday and one day each weekend for additional, scheduled model sessions.  They must be able to carry on development and completion of assignments during hours outside class time.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; As there will be insufficient time for mold-making or casting, students may choose to take away all finished works and/or provide a blank CD for transfer of photo documentation made by the instructor.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated cost of materials: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING: THE ADJACENT POSSIBLE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will experiment with a variety of ways to initiate and develop new ideas through drawing.   The term adjacent possible is a term used in science, referring to the evolutionary impulse or action of moving slightly away from an established position to a new position. Eventually, small increments of deviation become the stepping-stones for changes in species and the creation of new species.   &lt;br&gt; Activated by specific prompts, students will move forward in an incremental process to create new drawings, without pressure to make work that is loyal to their usual approach.  Without an expectation of familiarity or loyalty, students can innovate with a greater understanding of each changing variable that propels them to the next work.  Each prompt, for example a series of "rules," an introduction of a new visual language developed abstractly or performatively, or a homage to an artist, will begin the process. After an initial investigation, enhanced by discussion and research, students will be expected to continue drawing and to allow the integrity and specificity of the process to lead them in a new direction. By the end of the semester, students will have a vivid sense of how they made decisions and where they could proceed or return to an intersection to make different decisions. The body of works created throughout the semester can enhance the student's more established studio practice and/or serve to launch the student into new territory.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course will involve three components: 1) a field trip to the tree's site at the beginning of the semester; 2) classroom-based exploration of American history, memory, landscape, and material culture; and 3) studio-based building of a series of objects from the tree's wood, in response to both the site and students' classroom study. Overall, the course will explore both how material artifacts shape historical understanding and how historical knowledge can create meaningful design. Wood this year has been designated from the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site in Kinderhook, New York. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Students must also register for HPSS S732&lt;br&gt;Students will receive 3 credits in Furniture elective and 3 credits in HPSS, for a total of 6 credits&lt;br&gt; A single fee of $100.00 will be charged for your concurrent registration in HPSS S732/FURN 2451 courses.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Long known as the "Beehive" of industry, Providence RI is one of the most diverse manufacturing hubs in the US.  Although today's global market continues to absorb these resources, Providence has retained a highly skilled manufacturing center that is eager to work with the creative arts. This rare resource provides designers the unique ability to work locally with manufacturing re-sources from traditional lost wax casting to emerging manufacturing technologies such as laser cutting, multi-axis cnc, and rapid prototyping. Throughout the course we will visit manufacturing, marketing, and retail facilities to develop a working understanding of production processes and methods available to you and how best to effectively implement these resources into your work as a designer/artist.  The studio course will conclude with each student presenting a finished production ready object in multiples along with supporting marketing materials. By approaching this class from a design, manufacturing, and marketing perspective students will acquire a practical knowledge of production strategies essential to the success of a designer today. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIGHTING DESIGN 101</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $50.00 - $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective for Majors and Non-Majors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The junior studio expands and interprets the skills and concepts introduced in the sophomore studio. The primary focus of the semester is an experimentally based investigation of bending and forming techniques - molded plywood, bent lamination, steam bending, and vacuum-formed plastic. While focused on the use of wood and plastic materials, an experimental approach is expected in the studio.  Students are encouraged to conceptually explore skills and materials to develop a personal design approach and studio practice.  The semester culminates in a final design, in which students utilize learned techniques to create one-offs, objects intended for batch production or prototypes designed for production. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major requirement; Furniture majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Furniture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This semester is directed towards defining and organizing an  evolved artistic viewpoint that incorporates glass in a visual imagery.  At the beginning of this semester, students are  required to present a slide "source" presentation to a department assembly that is a compilation of the previous three semesters' visual research.  Each student is also expected to further develop his/her artistic association with a designated "outside" advisor(s) and involve this professional artist in critique and consultation.  Artistic premise and intention are comprehensively presented in a senior thesis exhibition. A complete portfolio is presented to the department at the completion of this semester.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $500.00&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, Glass majors only&lt;BR&gt; Must also register for GLASS 4322&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Glass department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN OPTICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class  serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses.  Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise.&lt;br&gt; Course also offered as D+M 7009.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF GLASS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since its chance discovery millennia ago, glass has developed into an integral and ubiquitous part of daily life. Through lectures, student presentations and field trips to the RISD museum and/or local glass studios, this course is designed to introduce students to the various ways this quixotic material has been made, used, and thought about across time. This survey course employs a chronological format and methodologies of art history, history of science, and material culture to investigate the range of glass objects, formulae, and production methods in use since glass' earliest manufacture through the mid-twentieth century. We will also examine the broader social and cultural contexts in which glass was made and explore the following themes as they relate to the history of glass: mimesis, clarity, innovation, reflection, light, and science. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for junior BFA.GLASS students&lt;br&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLASS SCULPTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of department head or instructor required &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Light and its observation will be explored as a means of understanding the potential of materials and design to manifest experiential qualities of light in the public realm. &lt;BR&gt;  Fine Art and Design students will work individually and in small collaborative research groups exploring light. Groups will develop devices that present an experience of light based on their research.  Weekly classes will include presentations, seminar discussions and demonstrations guided by faculty, James Carpenter and visiting critics.  The potential for inventing new methods of manipulating light will be encouraged.  Course work will include research, material investigations, seminars, lectures and field trips. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Please email glass@risd.edu if interested &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will consider the various ways in which manifold artists from Marcel Duchamp through Joseph Cornell, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Louise Lawler, Fred Wilson, Mark Dion and the Atlas Group have made aspects of the museum a subject matter of their work.  Alternatively engaged in a critique of museum practice or romantic evocations of the past, many artists for the past seventy years have addressed the staging devices that museums utilize to confer aura on the work of art as well as the makeup of their collections, categorization and behind the scenes storerooms and archives.   This history will be linked to an expanding body of writing that has emerged in the past three decades given to the differing discursive narratives that museums and their archives employ.  Writers such as Sigmund Freud, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, Ralph Rugoff, and Susan Stewart. will be considered.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graduate level only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART &amp; DESIGN: INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Many critics have argued that artists and designers have been used as exemplary models of a newly formed "nomadic," "creative," "interactive," or "casual" workforce. At the same time, collaboration has become valorized by many cultural and educational institutions. Given this scenario, we will ask whether collaboration has arrived at some neutral post-ideological state. Has collaboration ossified into a genre? Is collaboration a new name for the 90s corporate buzzword synergy, the symptom of some administrative impulse? Or does it express an emancipatory desire for something other than existing artistic and political structures? This course creates a forum to question whether the greater visibility of collaboration in art and design in recent years can have any critical purchase on perennial questions of authorship, agency, ownership, and value. We experiment with techniques to reinvest some kind of radical possibility (aesthetic, political, social) into the concept of collaboration as we develop our own ideas through discussion and practical application. &lt;br&gt;   We chart the relations between cultural producers and society at large, and consider collaboration as that which names varied and often conflicting practices. And we explore what these practices have to say about how art and society is produced, reproduced, and potentially re-imagined. The contested meaning of the term collaboration and how those practices are valued in their ideological, economic, ethical, and political dimensions will be our focus. &lt;br&gt;   This course involves critical and historical readings on relationality, performativity, labor theory, and political theory. Through case studies in collaborative art/design practices, we broach topics such as site specificity, public art, and artist collectives. Two visits to New York to meet with practitioners and visit exhibitions are scheduled, in addition to visits with artists and designers around Providence, and three short collaborative projects.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO LANGUAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In Imaginary Homelands, the Indian British author Salman Rushdie writes, "The word 'translation' comes, etymologically, from the Latin for 'bearing across.'  Having been borne across the world, we are translated [people].  It is normally supposed that something always gets lost in translation; I cling obstinately to the notion that something can also be gained." &lt;BR&gt;  What does our work in art and design gain from acts of translation?  How does a creative practice rooted in multilingual experience navigate linguistic and cultural hybridity?  How does material and conceptual contact between languages shape one's work or provide a foundation for asking large questions? &lt;BR&gt; This combination studio/seminar course explores the relationship between art and language on multiple scales.  We will collectively examine, through in-class discussions, lectures, readings and critique of studio assignments, how our relationships to language make possible an aesthetics of communication, a space where visual and verbal intersections speak of interactions between cultures.  Lectures will present the work of artists who use text, translation, voice, and language learning as strategies to parlay their sociolinguistic perceptions into agency.  Critique of student work produced in response to assignments will focus on an exploration of language within and around each student's art practice.  This course is recommended for those who speak more than one language or are interested in multiple Englishes and intercultural communication as material, subject and foundation for creative excavation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN PRACTICUM: WORK, MONEY, LOVE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;I&gt;The meeting with (Alighiero) Boetti changed my life in a day.  One of the first things he advised me to do when in conversation with artists (and designers) was always to ask them about their unrealized projects.  I have done it ever since. &lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt;                                                                                                                 Hans Ulrich Obrist, Curator &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Perhaps if the next generation of artists emerges more committed to the public sphere, more able to articulate the complexity of their intent, less intimidated by social ambivalences, they will feel more confident to insist that their essential importance to society be more greatly acknowledged.  If they enter society clear about their role and purpose, perhaps society will take them more seriously and come to understand that in denying artists their rightful place in public consciousness, we are in fact negating the most creative part of ourselves individually and collectively and in so doing as also damning our future to one without experimentation and the vision needed to give it meaning. &lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt;                                                                                                                     Carol Becker, Scholar, writer &lt;BR&gt;                              Funded by the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation (Marketplace Empowerment Program) and open to all graduate students in all disciplines, this "professional practices" and contemporary identities of creativity course explores models, philosophies, strategies, agilities, adaptive skills, conditions and resources crucial to developing and communicating self-aware, diverse, sustainable, relevant, and evolving practices in art and design.  The course utilizes and entangles several themes and metaphors - work, money, love - that characterize and form the many possible shapes of a life-long creative life and practice.  Work explores labor, manufacturing/fabrication, studio space and work environments, independent, collaborative, and diversified practice.  Money tackles legal and financial literacy, markets, grants, and fundraising.  Love invites students into writing, thinking, and making as discovery, collaboration, ethics, engagement, commitment, and persistence.  Other topics include "dangerous self-sufficiency," self-repair, attractions, exclusions, and multiple and mutable identities of artists, designers, and creative workers. &lt;BR&gt;   We will act as a research group on professional issues in art and design.  The goal is to experiment in democratic, flexible forms of pedagogy in which we support one another in thinking critically and expansively about the work we want to do, the ideas we want to cultivate, and the lives we choose to live.  In other words, we all will contribute and create content.  In addition to the instructor and students/participants in the course, visiting artists, designers, scholars, and other practitioners provide presentations, workshops, activities, and assignments over sustained meetings to broaden and deepen levels of inquiry, dialogue, and exchange-based experience.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL ISSUES IN CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar draws on a number of critical texts from the past three decades by writers such as Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, bell hooks, Dave Hickey, and Arthur C. Danto while probing their linkages to key debates in contemporary culture. By considering issues that relate to the viability of the expression of the artist025s subjectivity in the post-modern era as well topics pertaining to race, gender, sexuality, the marketplace, mass media and popular culture, a broad view of the subjects, themes and discourses of contemporary art emerges. The course is structured around in-class discussion of assigned articles, slide lectures, and presentations. The seminar aims to extend the range of critical texts currently read by each student especially as they develop their graduate thesis. Each student is responsible for one 30-minute class presentation with a follow-up paper of 10-12 pages due the last day of class, or before. Participation in class discussion is a requirement of the course, constituting a part of the final grade.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses on the graduate level inquiry of wood-based construction designs and commensurate skills. Lighting and upholstery techniques as well as outside vendor protocols may be employed depending on the graduate student's design needs. Graduate students develop a multi-lateral skill set applicable to their area of study. Thesis concepts are often explored within this class. Students concentrate, in sequence, six weeks of studio-based learning of numerous techniques and skills followed by six weeks of a dedicated, full-scale, designed and executed piece. Located in the Center for Integrated Technologies (CIT), the Graduate Studies Wood Studio focuses on contemporary and traditional joinery, shaping, and bent lamination construction techniques. Surface treatments and finishing methods for metal and wood also will be covered throughout this class. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Art and Design for Development graduate seminar is for students interested in exploring the role art and design can play in addressing social justice issues in vulnerable, under-resourced and often still-developing regions of the world.  The seminar positions the artist/designer as an innovator and activist and explores methodologies and rationale for applying strategic design thinking, processes, and outcomes to issues as complex and diverse as persistent poverty; displaced communities, human and environmental devastation due to war; human trafficking and enslavement; resource deprivation, lack of educational opportunity; livelihood needs, etc.  Strategic planning and action, systems thinking, participatory methods, resilience theory, and capacity building provide the theoretical underpinnings for the course and are discussed within a critical framework of the history of international development and ethics of engagement.  Critical to this effort will be the students' development of rigorous research skills and clear methodological approaches, and their ability to map and critique their own progress through a strategic design thinking process.   The seminar is project based, and situates this effort within an overview and critique of the methodologies and scales of engagement represented by contemporary social impact focused design practice.  Projects are undertaken by interdisciplinary teams and focus on the design of strategic action plans for communities and/or organizations currently partnering with RISD's DESINE-Lab-an interdisciplinary applied research group focused on employing design, innovation, and entrepreneurship to address social and environmental justice issues and drive community-based social and economic development.  As key players in these on-going relationships, class participants have opportunities to stay involved with DESINE-Lab activities, help implement the steps of the various plans through interning with partnering organizations, lead workshops in the field, and collaborate with future design-build efforts.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ORIGIN POINT: GRADUATE THESIS IDEATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The purpose of this seminar is to unearth a direction - an origin point - for your graduate thesis and to jump-start the writing process for the Master's written document. Organized as a series of writing intensive workshops, this forum will enable you to explore relevant ideas, themes, core values, and to conduct research in support of the inquiry process. The process involves seeking out and scrutinizing various angles of your perspective as an artist / designer. You will write from these angles to discover the emerging aspects of solutions that matter. Each class will suggest a specific theme or principle of inflection to precipitate what is needed for the work's progress. Included will be several forms of writing: profile, review, narrative essay, poem, report, extended caption, as well as several levels of research: journal and book reading, archival and fieldwork, and conversations and interviews. Emphasis will also be on maps of meaning that will be used as a way to further processes of ideation and understanding. At the conclusion of the seminar you will have a conceptual focus for your thesis that is clearly formulated visually and verbally. With this is place, the summer months can then be used productively to further the breadth and depth of this initial idea through open-ended exploration and self-generated work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Available to first-year graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GROUP CRITIQUE / CRITICAL DIALOGUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course serves as a forum for extended group critiques of the ongoing and self-initiated projects of its participants. While different disciplines have differing formats for critique, its practice in this class is not taken for granted. The course speculates on critique as a form-the crit, critique, and criticality as techniques. We trace our current conceptions of critique back to their historic precedents in Weimar in the 30s, Paris in the 60s, New York in the 80s, and examine how those strategies bear out today.  &lt;BR&gt;  In general, critiques are open-ended, generous, and rigorous analysis exchanged between peers, a means of examining both the conscious and unconscious drives in your work. Through group critiques students develop critical skills that help them articulate the conceptual and formal premises of their work. The goal of this course, regardless of discipline, is to foster a cogent and critical understanding of your practice that aida you in the elaboration and illumination of your ideas and push the development of your ongoing work. &lt;BR&gt;   The seminar portion of the class includes examinations of practitioners tailored to fit the  interests of participating students. In addition we examine readings on critical theory, psychoanalysis, and institutional critique: Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, Jacques Lacan, Felix Guattari, Jacques Rancire, Andrea Fraser, Gregg Bordowitz, Alexander Alberro, and others.    &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TIME / TECHNICS / MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"I know very well what time is," writes Augustine in the Confessions, "until the moment you ask me, and then I do not know."  This philosophical candor was much admired by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who advised that what we cannot speak of we must therefore remain silent.  Time, in itself imperceptible, is rendered salient through a variety of intercessionary technologies, utilizing sand, shadow, water, or more complex kinetic devices, to make visible, or audible, its 'passage.'  Time can be measured through the body in any number of ways: the physical aging of our bodies, our kinetic movements, the performance of our everyday actions, and our changing outward personal style or disposition.  Aesthetic forms, scientific and literary productions 'unfold' in time, moving toward an inexorable conclusion, end, closure or renewal.  Phenomena persist, endure, and dissipate. In our contemporaneity time-based media are ubiquitous, and the intimacy between, for example, a naturally produced utterance and its technical reproducibility has become coextensive.&lt;br&gt; In this seminar we will begin with an inquiry into the nature of time, beginning with the pre-Socratics, carrying through to Kant, Heidegger, Agamben and Stiegler; at the same time we will also examine the notion of 'technical-being' or techn&amp;#233;, contrasted with biological, living being, bios, z&amp;#246;on.  But the primary orientation of this seminar will address the medial or technical and aesthetic register of time-based processes and devices.  From the camera obscura to telephony, from the incunabula of the proto-cinema to current digital globalizations, we will explore both the materialities and the theories of time, technics and media, and the complexities they entail. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: A GUIDED DRAWING SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media yet drawing can be independent of all other media. Can we make our drawing ventures have resonance? The goal is to understand drawing in a multivalent way through paced experiences and investigations via short research projects, three generative series and development of a sited-drawing plan. Methods will include teamed technical presentations of expertise or interest as well as examples of ancient and historical means of silverpoint, transfer drawings, panoramas and dioramas. Drawing epochs represented in the RISD Museum of Art, collection will be examined (through works by artists such as Wilfredo Lam, Gego, or the Rimpa period Korin Gafu.) Focused critiques, readings and guided and self-directed independent studio production are components. This seminar could be paired with the grad course Object Lessons.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as a requirement for MA, ARTE 658G.

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graduate level only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

As such, it excites speculation on the creation of new objects and environments that offer experiences not possible before.  By learning about recent advancements in smart materials, biomaterials, and other technologies that are structured at the nano-scale and micro-scale, we'll explore the creation of some fresh, promising applications at the macro-scale, and make prototypes that lend vision to their novelty and merit.  &lt;br&gt; Please note that you do not need any advanced knowledge of science, technology, and engineering to enroll in this course. The only prerequisites are the wonder and curiosity that stir the creative imagination, and some making skills. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUBLIC(ATION)S SPRING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the past decade or so, dozens of new forums featuring writing by artists and designers have emerged (think Design Observer, Dot Dot Dot, Triple Canopy, Cabinet, F.R. David, Mousse, Creative Time Reports, and Journal for Artistic Research, to name a few), and whether by cause or effect, artists and designers are contributing to cultural discourse like never before.  This year-long course invites grads from all disciplines to explore and practice writing, editing, and producing for publics and publications.  The course takes place over the entire year, meeting biweekly in Fall and Spring and once in Wintersession, and comprises two concurrent parts:   &lt;BR&gt; 1) A literature review of some of the above publications (and others, collectively determined), including visits with some of their editors and writers, culminating in individual annotated bibliographies and an article submission;   &lt;BR&gt; 2) The class will become the staff of the newly revived "RISD Grad Book"-envisioning, commissioning, editing, writing for, and (pending graphic design expertise among the class) designing this annual view into RISD's graduate education, in both print and online forms.   &lt;BR&gt; Throughout, we will write, with a focus on developing an audience, a purpose, a voice, and a relationship between art and design practice and writing, as well as an ability to navigate page and screen and the text-image-sound affordances of digital media.  All forms of writing-scholarly, journalistic, critical, experimental, electronic, image- or design-driven, or hybrid-are welcome.  The course combines guest lectures, seminar-style discussions of readings, workshop-style discussions of student writings, presentations of annotated bibliographies and submissions, hands-on editorial work, peer review, and intensive one-on-one feedback from the instructors.  Upon completing the course, students will demonstrate knowledge of available publications and platforms, awareness of who their audiences/publics are, and wide-ranging skills applicable to a variety of writing contexts.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Note: course meets bi-weekly (every other Friday) in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 on FRIDAYS, 1:10-4:10pm and on one full day in Wintersession 2016.

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of humanitarian intervention in different parts of the world.  From designing refugee camps and village schools to water filtration systems and weaving patterns that could compete in Western markets, they are not only making physical objects for disenfranchised across the world, but also shaping how we understand the problems at hand as well as the people in need.  This extended role demands a new ethical sensibility and historical knowledge in addition to technical know-how and aesthetic capability.  What does it mean to act ethically in a global context?  What is the nature of responsibility?  How do we communicate across difference without turning whom we seek to help into convenient caricatures of helpless poor?  Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions, leaving larger political and policy discussions for other disciplines?  Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself?  &lt;BR&gt; This course will ask these hard questions and unpack them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study.  This is not a "how-to" course.  Nor will we use ready-made definitions of ethics to endorse convenient and familiar ways of working.  This is a course about thinking.  We will slowly shape an understanding of ethics as a way of introducing reflective friction in our modes of operation and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use.  Course material will include mind-opening historical and theoretical texts, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films.  Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making, and vice versa, invited.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Our exploration follows three tracks: we examine artifacts from the fields of design, fashion and medical engineering, as well as experimental propositions from the visual and conceptual arts, literature and film; we pair these case studies with scholarship that critically engages issues of embodiment and material agency; and we attend to the political and ethical debates raised by dynamic conceptions of posthuman bodies.  Interdisciplinary readings across the humanities and social sciences include: Appadurai, Freud, Haraway, Hayles, Heidegger, Latour, Marx, Miller, and Scary.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL PEDAGOGY COLLOQUIUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>&lt;I&gt;Each of us talks because we are in the same place: we co-loquate.  "Colloquium" is an unpretentious term, unlike the term "dialogue."  &lt;/I&gt;               Jacques Lacan  &lt;BR&gt;  The exception explains the general and itself.  And if one wants to study the general correctly, one only needs to look around for a true exception.  It reveals everything more clearly than does the general.  Endless talk about the general becomes boring; there are exceptions.  If they cannot be explained, then the general also cannot be explained.  The difficulty is usually not noticed because the general is not thought about with passion but with a comfortable superficiality.  The exception, on the other hand, thinks the general with intense passion.                    Soren Kierkegaard  &lt;BR&gt; Our focus will be reflective and dynamic teaching in the context of college/university art and design education. Our topics and considerations will be relevant to more broadly-based ideas of teaching and learning in different settings, as well as ways that pedagogy has been infused discursively in contemporary art and design practices.  I look forward to the opportunity to explore with you, deeply and authentically, ideas and issues, strategies and tactics, theories and practices of contemporary pedagogy and teaching through the lens of your own Wintersession 2016 teaching.  &lt;BR&gt; Some Colloquiium meetings will include guests who will discuss their work and insights on teaching, learning, and pedagogy.  I expect that our conversations will flow between theory and practice, pedagogical concepts and direct experience, actionable information and speculative questions as learners, teachers, artists, designers, and writers.  Our format will be conversational and colloquial; you are invited and expected to participate and shape the content and character of our work together.  Selected readings will bring focus to our work together.  &lt;BR&gt; You are required to attend all five sessions.  If you are ill or unable to attend for some other legitimate reason, kindly let me know before our weekly meeting.  At the conclusion of the Colloquium, you will receive either a Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory evaluation.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; "I do not think that I will give you my teaching in the form of a pill; I think that would be difficult."     &lt;/I&gt;        Jacques Lacan  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FAB LAB</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This five-week workshop at the beginning of the fall, Wintersession, and spring semesters (1-credit each) as well as an end of semester project which gives students a well-rounded introduction to the use of digital fabrication tools and an overview of their applications in both art and design.  The course also functions as a gateway to Co-Works, RISD's cross-departmental fab lab and experimental workspace; successful completion of the workshop grants access beyond the time frame of the course.  &lt;br&gt; Co-Works features digital tools such as 3D printers, laser cutters, 4-axis CNC mill, plotter cutter, CNC hot wire foam cutter, CNC embroidery machine, UV printer that applies color to 3D surfaces, and related software.  Co-Works also includes more "traditional" fabrication technologies such as vacuum formers, large format 2D printing, industrial sewing machines, and sergers.  Through technical demos and class projects, students are trained in the proper use of many of these tools as time and interest dictates.  &lt;BR&gt; The course explores the theoretical implications of this technology and situates it within the context of contemporary art and design practices. Through slide presentations, readings, class discussions, and visiting artist lectures, students are encouraged to think critically about the role of digital tools in contemporary art and design and in their own practices.  Students develop hybrid approaches incorporating both "traditional" and "new" processes.  Class projects encourage experimentation, innovation, and interdisciplinary collaboration as well as provide opportunities for individual exploration.  No prior experience with 3D modeling or digital fabrication is required.  Participation from all majors and departments is strongly encouraged.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; This course is open to all graduate students, with a number of seats held for undergraduates by permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIES SALON 1</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is the first section of a 3-term cumulative workshop for the full 2015-16 academic year. The Salon will be driven collaboratively by the interests of the graduate students.  It will invite scholars, lecturers, thinkers, tinkerers, artists, publishers, and others to present to the Salon and larger RISD community.   As possible, studio visits will be arranged or group critiques organized around special topics and inquiries.  The Salon will have a peripatetic character, often "occupying" different locations at RISD and in Providence directly relating to our visiting lecturers areas of interest.  This will encourage a close connection to the many resources available to graduate students, as well as call attention to the role of the artist /designer within institutions of learning, history, and knowledge preservation and creation.  Ideally, the Salon will be collaboratively oriented and will have a skill-share component and produce one or more collaborative projects (that may take the form of a sculpture, publication, show, installation) inspired by our learning at the end of the year.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUBLIC(ATION)S SPRING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the past decade or so, dozens of new forums featuring writing by artists and designers have emerged (think Design Observer, Dot Dot Dot, Triple Canopy, Cabinet, F.R. David, Mousse, Creative Time Reports, and Journal for Artistic Research, to name a few), and whether by cause or effect, artists and designers are contributing to cultural discourse like never before.  This year-long course invites grads from all disciplines to explore and practice writing, editing, and producing for publics and publications.  The course takes place over the entire year, meeting biweekly in Fall and Spring and once in Wintersession, and comprises two concurrent parts:   &lt;BR&gt; 1) A literature review of some of the above publications (and others, collectively determined), including visits with some of their editors and writers, culminating in individual annotated bibliographies and an article submission;   &lt;BR&gt; 2) The class will become the staff of the newly revived "RISD Grad Book"-envisioning, commissioning, editing, writing for, and (pending graphic design expertise among the class) designing this annual view into RISD's graduate education, in both print and online forms.   &lt;BR&gt; Throughout, we will write, with a focus on developing an audience, a purpose, a voice, and a relationship between art and design practice and writing, as well as an ability to navigate page and screen and the text-image-sound affordances of digital media.  All forms of writing-scholarly, journalistic, critical, experimental, electronic, image- or design-driven, or hybrid-are welcome.  The course combines guest lectures, seminar-style discussions of readings, workshop-style discussions of student writings, presentations of annotated bibliographies and submissions, hands-on editorial work, peer review, and intensive one-on-one feedback from the instructors.  Upon completing the course, students will demonstrate knowledge of available publications and platforms, awareness of who their audiences/publics are, and wide-ranging skills applicable to a variety of writing contexts.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Note: course meets bi-weekly (every other Friday) in Fall 2015 and Spring 2016 on FRIDAYS, 1:10-4:10pm and on one full day in Wintersession 2016. Fall schedule: September 18; October 2, 16, 30; November 13, and December 4, 2015. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This introductory course is intended for non-majors interested in learning the basic principles of typography including the study of letterforms, type classification, legibility, organization and hierarchy, as well as text applications, grid systems and page layout. Typography will be explored as both a means of communication and a vehicle for expression. Projects may include comparative studies for setting text and poetry, letterhead systems, brochure or poster. This course will provide a solid foundation for moving on to more complex typographic problems such as book, motion or web design.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As screens become a primary delivery method for information and visual form, graphic designers are confined to working in exceedingly smaller viewports. This course will refocus our attention to the physical environment as an opportunity for graphic interruption and large scale works. Students will investigate issues of modularity, duplication, architectural framing, placement, and interruption as potential for inserting graphic form into our collective environment, both physically and through the use of projection. Throughout the semester, we will reference poster design, supergraphics, exhibition signage, way finding systems, and art installations as disciplines in which graphic designers are producing work at dramatic scale.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Open to Senior, Graduate&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?

This course explores the book for that potential: as an interactive time/space medium for a kind of hyper-experience wherein the 'reader' is both co-pilot and co-author to unfold a narrative of ideas from what is seen, touched, heard, performed and read. The course explores the nature of 'experience' and 'poetics' as core issues in the design process and to help us tap into the depth of perception and innovation. Our means for inquiry is to constantly produce bookworks via experimentation and play, supplemented by an array of relational topics (semiotics, mindfulness, Concretism, the spiritual in art, perennial philosophy, Fluxus, indeterminacy). The special course time slot is designed to optimize the studio experience and to include alternate means and environments for work, play, insight and inspiration.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;/i&gt;       </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications.&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, and graduate.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BOOKLAB Booklab</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is a book in the 21st century? What could it be?  &lt;br&gt; We are living in a period of major transition, a massive shift from the page to the screen. Our relationship to books, both as objects and as texts, is changing. But the purported death of the book provides an opportunity for formal, typographic, and conceptual innovation-pushing the boundaries of both print and digital forms.  &lt;br&gt; Booklab is an experimental studio examining the present and future of the book as site, as subject, and as form. What is the relationship between physical books and digital books? How will we read in this new, networked environment? How does book design become interaction design, and vice versa? What can a book do?  &lt;br&gt; Students will explore the form and design of the book, as well as the ecosystem surrounding books and reading - the bookshelf, the library, the screen, and beyond.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to Graphic Design majors only.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY FOR NONMAJORS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This introductory course is intended for non-majors interested in learning the basic principles of typography including the study of letterforms, type classification, legibility, organization and hierarchy, as well as text applications, grid systems and page layout. Typography will be explored as both a means of communication and a vehicle for expression. Projects may include comparative studies for setting text and poetry, letterhead systems, brochure or poster. This course will provide a solid foundation for moving on to more complex typographic problems such as book, motion or web design.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Junior and Above&lt;BR&gt; Graphic Design majors only&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate  Students Only. Graphic Design Majors Only or by special permission if space permits&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications.&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, and graduate.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Design is an ever-expanding field that demands students be accustomed to constant change and requires the development of confidence and core competencies for life-long practice. Students will learn to identify design opportunities and areas of inquiry within question-based units framed by the faculty team.&lt;br&gt;   Each unit will vary in length, and will begin with a particular question to kick-off the process. For each unit, students will move through research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping and will be asked to communicate their findings. Units will increase in complexity over the four semesters, and are sequenced to move from a guided process to more open, self-generated methodologies. Units will be inquiry-based, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes to open questions. &lt;br&gt;  By the end of the year, each student should be in tune with his or her own working methods and will have the ability to frame projects independently and with self determination. Inherent in the course format is a kind of elasticity and nimbleness that should allow for group projects, social &amp; cultural engagement, and formal investigations instigated through a variety of faculty-posed questions. &lt;br&gt;  Some examples of the questions (prompts) students receive might be: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?  or How can you prevent people from texting while driving? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement: 3-year GRAPH MFA students Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE &amp; IMAGE IN MOTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We stand firmly planted in a visual world, surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors and more-as large as towering billboards and as small as compact cell phones. Such images provide us with clues about our environment, feeding our mind with information that we find useful for survival or for orientation purposes. But these very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us from discerning what is truly important. How do we tell them apart? The primary goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to create meaningful and intelligent images. Course content is tailored for three levels of experience - introductory, intermediate and advanced. Some of the class projects include documentary photography, film title design and music video. The works of Saul Bass, Bill Viola and Michel Gondry will be used as the "textbooks" for this course. Readings, film screenings and listening exercises accompany studio work. Some knowledge of Adobe Flash or After Effects or Final Cut Pro would be helpful but is not required.

   <COURSEDESC>With emphasis on open search and experimentation this course explores how we experience the visible word. We will consider how typographic form can serve that purpose to read, frame, engage and inspire the depth and breadth of meaning. After brief introductory assignments to establish common ground, the course format becomes an open laboratory for individual (or collaborative) interests and inquiries. Participants are encouraged to experiment with the visible word such as to explore: the de/reconstruction of texts; type in 3-d space, or in motion, or in digital media; words and the sensory experience of materiality, sound, projection; text as poetry in public environments; visual and concrete poetry. Topics for inquiry can range from the practical to the poetical, to the purely experimental. Course work can supplement other course interests (especially graduate thesis work and degree projects).&lt;br&gt;With permission of instructor required it is necessary to receive the approval in writing from the instructor at a week before registration via email: tockerse@risd.edu (it will help to communicate your course interest, and even a project interest)&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN AND THE GALLERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the intersections between curation, design and art through approaches to curatorial programming and exhibition design that are not of the norm or current conventions. As creative fields expand and diversify outside of their traditional roles, the role of the curator, the designer, has responded to the dynamic shifts occurring in the field, creating opportunities to create events, collections, and exhibitions that are responsive, participatory and dynamic. &lt;br&gt; Rather than looking at the white cube as a site to hang images, the course seeks to explore how environment and/or site could compel new content to be generated, but also new ways of exhibiting work. It integrates concept and form to manifest as a physical, dimensional representation. &lt;br&gt; The course will include lectures by three given visiting critics who will act as the three "models"/types: curator, designer, etc. The students will develop three exhibitions in collaboration with these "models" and attempt to create new ways of exhibiting work, but also collaborating with these people. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major electivel Graphic Design majors only; nonmajors by permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; Open to seniors and graduate students &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY IN 3D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The use of typography in the 3D space is a compelling one. With both a strong formal dimension and an informational function, typography will provide a coherent program with a real sense of order. If it is applied with a comprehensive system, this sense of unity allows for better communication. The typography display in the space is built with different parts related to one another by a system. In order to understand the nature of a very well organized typographic program, our point of view must be fundamentally structural. Such an approach allows us to discern the sophisticated underlying relationship between parts which creates a sense of wholeness.  &lt;BR&gt; This Cross-disciplinary course will offer the students of Interior Architecture and Graphic Design the opportunity of working with typography in 3 Dimensional Space.&lt;BR&gt;   Students will apply the use of proportion, hierarchy, and legibility in two aspects of the 3D space: A Wayfinding project and a Museum Exhibition. &lt;BR&gt;   The course will explore the methodology required to work with typographic systems in the 3 Dimensional environment, applying the narrative aspect of information. Specific attention will be devoted to exploring the methodology of designing in different scales and the ability to translate 2 dimensional content to a 3 Dimensional display. Studies will include setting text in small and big scales, the use of grids, and the application of a comprehensive system.   &lt;BR&gt; This course will be concerned with the process which controls the structure and properties of applying big scale typography and further students understanding of how applying information typographically can challenge a space. Through formal, geometric, and spatial analytic processes, students will build systems with two considerations: The interdisciplinary planning and design process between an Architect and a Graphic Designer as well as the application of a Sign System within the Adaptive Reuse project. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Also listed as GRAPH 3198.

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTAL PUBLISHING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Publishing has never been a fixed notion. "What is publishing today?" remains a relevant inquiry, but with an increasingly expanded field of response, as platforms, channels and modes of production mutate and multiply. Let's begin with the post, exposing its origins as a physical note publicly nailed to a piece of wood. Its descendants persist today, plainly visible on the wall, in the feed and in the stream as traces of a deeper history of documents - the scriptural economy.   &lt;BR&gt; Is posting (always) publishing? We'll examine substrate, blankness and the possibility of saying nothing as a post-media publishing strategy. And as certain legacies recede (privacy, authorship, copyright), how is publishing still "making public?" Let's unpack (and entangle) these and other ways to explore the public circulation of work in a post-digital space. We'll draw trajectories to and from the emergence of the networked artist in the 20th century, into the last twenty years, and particularly around the last two, as self-publishing becomes more and more inseparable from the artist's ambient practice (and work) itself. &lt;BR&gt;   The semester will be devoted to the creation of our own performing publishing studio, disseminating work as a highly diffused, ongoing performance, rather than discrete events. The development of publishing manifestos and projects, working in public, research-based exploration, non-traditional tools and platforms, experimentation and collaboration will be encouraged. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graphic Design majors only; open to seniors and graduate students &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHAPING LANGUAGE: A STUDIO COURSE ON THE MATERIALITY OF WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Writing is a flexible material and molds to multiple forms: as tweets, texts, code, and pixels; abstraction, sculpture, art and news; in 2D, 3D, books, and screen; for public, private, galleries, and commerce. While graphic designers have a deep kinship to the world of words, we are rarely tasked with making the words we shape.  What could writing look like if we were concerned with the whole expression, from writing to form, and vise versa? What if the boundaries between the two were no longer rigid or distinct and we treated writing as making, and making as writing.  &lt;br&gt; In this studio, we will explore what it means to shape language--we will write in multiple ways, and even re-define what 'writing' means as we frame and respond to project prompts. Through a series of short and long projects, students will investigate the power we have to expand the experience of words, both for ourselves as designers, form-makers and readers; as well as for our audiences. This studio establishes a space--a lab of sorts--for students who are writers, thinkers, wordsmiths, text or type enthusiasts. We will encourage and consider everything from the most intimate paper-based word/text explorations, to screen-based work, to language systems or code, to monumental and sculptural word experiments. As long as language is the medium, projects can be very open. &lt;br&gt; As we make our own work, we will also read and consider work by various wordsmiths, including but not limited to Kenneth Goldsmith, Anne Carson, Anne Hamilton, Ed Ruscha, Hito Steyerl, Xu Bing, Dieter Roth, Agnes Martin, Mira Schendel, to name just a few.  &lt;br&gt; The course will culminate in a publication that documents our explorations and experiments. Course open to graduate and undergraduate &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graphic Design majors, Juniors and above; all others by permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Film and graphic design share an omnivorousness that devours all other media, and achieving mastery in either can fill a lifetime. Not coincidentally, similar questions are central to both forms: the careful deployment and control of image, color, text, tone, pacing, editing, communication, history, taste. the list of overlaps is long.  &lt;br&gt; Through a series of small exercises and short readings, culminating in a self-initiated multi-week project, this class seeks to offer a route into exploratory filmmaking that builds on the training and knowledge of a graphic designer. Skills will be learned through demonstrations and collaborative problem solving. The presumption is that projects will be executed in a film format, but this is not a requirement. Emphasis will be on finding a way to address problem solving in an unfamiliar time-based medium in a way that works for you.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the first two semesters of a two-year studio track, students will come into contact with  issues and questions that face the contemporary designer. Students will engage with and develop methods to take on these questions: search (formal and intellectual), research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping. Projects will increase in complexity over time, sequenced to evolve from guided inquiry to more open, self-generated methodologies. Some examples of the questions students might work with are: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Requirement, Sophomore Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department;course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology across Asia, Africa and the Americas will be explored utilizing the RISD Museum of Art with frequent visits to the textile and costume collections. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Students will also have opportunity to examine various methods of textile display, analysis and storage appropriate to items of cultural heritage via case studies of specific objects in the RISD Museum.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL-LOCAL CONTEMPORARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is globalism, and should we be celebrating it? Can we disentangle globalism from capitalism, and what is at stake in this effort? And what happens to the specificity of the local - the base of the political - in the internationalist flows of contemporary art? Examining notions of canon, legacy, influence, discourse, history, tradition, place and displacement, this seminar maps the current state of international contemporary art. It focuses on the recent artistic, scholarly, critical and curatorial attempts to reroute the linear trajectories of late modernism. Such initiatives all aim at conceiving an expanded - or even exploded - cartography of contemporary art. What might such a map look like? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE "MASTERPIECES" RETURN: A CRITICAL ART HISTORY OF CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our visual culture has become unthinkable without screened moving images. Writers have imitated film; leaders have used cinema as propaganda; artists have mediated film language; and artists have made avant-garde films. Critics establish rules for film evaluation, even as artists challenge traditional notions of masterpiece. Contemporary film-makers continue to offer visual spectacles, political debates, and intriguing psychological plots. How can we define modern, post-modern, and contemporary masterpieces of cinema as industrial production and capitalist bio-politics? How do we make aesthetic judgments after a century of cinema?  Students will study film interpretation and realize how cinema can shape our technological, aesthetic and political environment. Course requirements: two papers, short reports, and weekly class discussions of films and readings.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The course will examine how female painters, photographers, writers, film directors and performance artists use their bodies and elements of their biographies to build their art upon. We will watch feature and documentary films, read essays, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role biographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Cindy Sherman, Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven, Maya Deren, Frida Kahlo, Leonora Carrington, Ana Mendieta, Faith Ringgold, Marina Abramovic, Shirin Neshat, Agnes Varda, and Francesca Woodman. Students will do weekly readings; write weekly papers, as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through close study of houses, interiors, furnishings, and a range of texts, this seminar will explore multiple concepts of domesticity and ways these have informed design practice. Classes will be conducted as collaborative workshops focusing on discussion of assigned texts and analysis of images. Student research projects will investigate a contemporary work of design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL VOCABULARY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class provides an introduction to contemporary art theory and its philosophical underpinnings.  Through critical readings in philosophy, literary theory, psychoanalysis, and art history, this course aims to familiarize students with the occasionally obscure, and sometimes blustery language of contemporary art.  Each class we approach a single term: such as "fetish," "neo-avant-garde" or "relational aesthetics;" or analyze dialogic pairings like "author/authority" or "origin/originality."  We examine the historical trajectories and philosophical underpinnings of these terms, charting their shifting and at times contradictory meanings. We also discuss some of the key texts of contemporary art in which these critical terms appear, and finally we consider what is at stake in the use of this critical vocabulary.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the "mayline," the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already "epistemic" things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

It will also focus on the range of issues that museums in general are currently addressing such as ethics, provenance, audience, and architecture. There will be visits to storage areas with curators to understand the scope of the collection, as well as sessions on topics such as conservation, education, installation, and exhibition development. Written assignments will include preparing catalogue entries for recent acquisitions, developing gallery guides, analyzing current exhibitions and/or devising proposals for reinstallation of the permanent collection. The course is designed particularly for those students who have had little behind-the-scenes experience in museums.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as GRAD 500G 01 with limited seating for graduate students desiring graduate seminar credit.

   <COURSEDESC>A complement to the fall semester History of Design: Antiquity to the Renaissance, this course continues the developmental trajectory of design and the decorative arts beginning in the mid-17th century with Baroque court designers and the unity of style in furnishings and interiors. Following themes will also include: the rise industrial design to serve the middle class consumer, the function of pattern books in the dissemination of taste and style, the pivotal role of expositions and World's Fairs, the inception of design schools and the search for 'good design'. Emphases will be placed on the significant contributions of individual craftsmen and designers and their firms, as well as movements and the institutions that support them, including Morris &amp; Co., the Bauhaus, Droog and many others.  Lectures will be supplemented with regular gallery visits to the RISD Museum, highlighting pieces in the collection that best characterize the ingenuity, technology, function, and aesthetic interests of their times.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>French Surrealism played an important role in the development of 20th-century European and American art.  The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE VISUAL CULTURE OF ROMANTICISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Romantic concepts about the omnipotence of nature encouraged the ideals of human equality and democracy.  The Romantic search for truth, authenticity, and identity permeated empirical experience, feelings, and emotion. In this course we examine the visual expressions of Romantic ideals with particular focus on art of the 19th century.  We explore how images conceptualized morality, religious thought, nationalism, and human rights, as well as the new role of the artist as public intellectual, prophet and seer.  Readings from Romantic literature and a variety of contemporary texts will provide the social, intellectual and political context.  The enduring influence of Romantic thought on American art and life will provide our subtext.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART, CRAFTS &amp; POLITICS OF INTERNATIONAL ESSAY FILMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Literary and philosophical essays have each had an illustrious history. In the cinema, essay films constitute a controversial genre similar but different from documentary, experimental, avant-garde or political film.  Essay filmmakers create non-fictional works as aesthetic and political weapon "at the intersection of subjective rumination and social history." They exhibit the presence of an author and call for critical interpretations, even as they remix and explore archives of moving images.  Present in installations and on the web, these artists are globally popular as political and aesthetic provocateurs.  They offer intellectual pleasures other than those of conventional narratives by reinventing the "arts and crafts" of "screen culture." We will study essay films from diverse times and places, and review notions and theoretical categories: avant-garde, self-reflexivity, auteur. Requirements: two papers, short reports, and weekly class discussions of films and readings.&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

In this course we will examine altarpieces by artists such as Van Eyck and Van Der Weyden which showed a new religious vision expressed in oil paint. We will consider prints by Durer, which widely distributed the ideas of the Italian Renaissance, and portraits by Hoblein and paintings by Bruegel which suggest a new post-Reformation world view. We will also study sculpture and architecture of the period.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the 238 years of the Shaker experience in America the artisans and designers of this utopian communal religious group created a world of artisanry and design distinguished by simple practicality and lasting aesthetic appeal. This course examines the visual culture -- the architecture, furniture, woodenware, textiles, drawings, metalwork, and other material evidence of the Shaker experience -- in the context of the Shaker belief that the work of Shaker hands is consecrated by spirituality. Requirements for this course include two Saturday field trips to Shaker villages in Massachusetts and Maine.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>METHODOLOGY/HISTORIOGRAPHY: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassa's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine art in Russia and the USSR from the October Revolution in 1917 to the death of Stalin in 1953 in the context of historical events and changing ideological climate. &lt;BR&gt; After the October Revolution, art and film in Russia and later the USSR became a field of unprecedented experimentation that gave birth to many groundbreaking works by artists and filmmakers such as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Tatlin, Alexandr Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanowa, the Stenberg Brothers, Sergei Eisenstein, Vsevolod Pudovkin, and others. The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: PAPERMAKING, TEMPLES AND PRINTS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTS OF JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material: its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Register for PRINT-4525 and you will be added to this Art History class by the Registrar &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required &lt;br&gt; Registration begins on October 10 and ends on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.&lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Alexander the Great is one of the most significant figures in ancient history, and the culturally diverse empire he created gave birth to new trends in art characterized by hybrid styles and innovative new kinds of artistic propaganda.  The study of the place of art in such a multicultural society has implications for the interpretation of art's role in the modern world.  This course will discuss the way Alexander and his successors controlled their image in art and the styles of sculpture, painting, architecture, and urban planning that were precipitated by the socio-political changes brought about by his conquests.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE GRAND TOUR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this seminar, students will investigate the role of the artist on The Grand Tour, a cultural pilgrimage through Europe made by budding aristocrats during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The Grand Tour came to represent a rite of passage for Tourists, and opened up new markets and opportunities for artists in their native cities and abroad. Though often of a different social class than 'tourists' proper, artists increasingly traveled with them and supplemented their earnings by serving as drawing masters and guides.  They set up workshops and studios in key cities where Grand Tourists purchased pictures, prints, sculpture and decorative objects that would be exhibited in libraries, gardens and galleries built for their display back home. In this course, we examine a variety of works and objects, both in class and at the RISD Museum, that represent the dynamic relationships between tourists and the artists whose works they commissioned and collected.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Clark, Anne Wagner, Benjamin Buchloh and Carrie Lambert-Beatty. After several classes that ground these issues historically, the focus of the seminar will be on the contemporary, examining the work of artists as Hans Haacke, Allan Sekula, Alfredo Jaar, Zoe Leonard, Pascale Marthine Tayou, Thomas Hirschhorn, David Goldblatt, Santaigo Sierra, Ai Weiwi, DJ Martinez, Trevor Paglen, Allora and Calzadilla and Kudzanai Chiurai. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Did aliens build the pyramids?  What happened to the lost city of Atlantis?  Does a Mayan carving depict a space shuttle?  Who were the real first settlers of the Americas?  Humans have always struggled to make sense of the remains left by past cultures.  Through careful, measured study by archaeologists and historians we have been able to create a scientific and historically informed understanding of the traits and accomplishments of ancient peoples.  At the same time, alternative, flashier, fantastic theories about the past  - even occasionally archaeological hoaxes  - are regularly presented in popular culture on television, in the movies and on the internet.  These theories, referred to as pseudoscience, are not based on the rigorous logic and evidence used by archaeologists, but rather represent a range of biases and flawed interpretations.  This course will critically examine popular and fantastic views of archaeological sites and discoveries.  We will begin by establishing how archaeologists conduct analyses and form their theories.  We will then explore a series of pseudoscientific case studies, in which we will critically evaluate the evidence and logic behind these theories, as well as their impact on our understanding of the past.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course provides an introduction to the study of visual arts in Chinese history. It will introduce the major developments and themes of Chinese visual culture, interpreted broadly to include bronzes, jades, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, textiles, printing, ceramics, and architecture. The lectures will follow a chronological and thematic course through the development of visual culture in China. We will consider how to position these objects within a historical and cultural context, with particular attention to the interactions between visual arts and gender, religion, politics, and ethnic identity. Using formal analysis, and reconstructing production processes and consumption contexts, we will learn how to describe, research, and discuss objects of Chinese visual arts. We will also explore the recirculation of these objects, both in China and abroad, and how far theories and methodologies of Western art history can be productively applied to Chinese visual culture. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar course examines the experience of East Asian women through their visual and material representation in painting, prints, sculpture, murals, and photographs. From the earliest classical period through to the twentieth century, we will explore how Chinese, Korean and Japanese images of women reveal women's changing positions and roles in family and society. Through themes that include gender, patriarchy, virtue, sexuality, beauty, life cycles, and body practices, we will consider how notions of femininity and womanhood were constructed, re-invented and re-interpreted in different socio-cultural contexts of nation-building, modernity, colonialism, consumerism, and globalization, and how visual culture allows us to question and expand established historical narratives. Class sessions will combine short lectures with in-depth reading discussions, close analysis of images, film viewings, and visits to the RISD museum.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This lecture course uses the 2013-14 Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition &lt;I&gt;Interwoven Globe: The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800&lt;/I&gt; as a starting point to examine the role of Asian textiles and dress in the globalized markets of the early modern era. Using paradigms of global history and methodologies of material culture, we will explore how channels of trade, migration, and diplomacy enabled cottons and silks from India, China, and Japan to travel around the world and capture the imaginations of distant markets. What role did textiles like Indian chintzes or Chinese trade silks play in changing the consumption patterns and behaviors of Western European and North American society? How was the production and design of objects like the Kashmir shawl or the Manila shawl themselves transformed by transfer to new locales and societies through import and imitation? In order to understand the processes by which traditional designs and constructions were adapted for far-off markets and consumers, students will engage in close study of artifacts from the RISD museum collection of trade textiles. Assignments will allow students to develop skills in writing museum exhibition labels, longer catalogue entries, and also a research paper that more fully explores the design and development of these fascinating textiles.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DOCUMENTARY PHOTOGRAPHY AS CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is documentary photography? What does it show, how is it shown, and what does it do? This course will explore the history and efficacy of documentary photography as an aesthetic and political mode of image making. The course will focus on the rise of documentary photography as a fine art in the second half of the twentieth century and its continued influence on the ways that the medium has evolved in contemporary art. Each session will focus on a type of documentary photography and discuss relevant texts on the issues involved. Active participation in class discussion is required.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IDENTITY IN FLUX: PHOTO PORTRAITURE FROM DAGUERROTYPE TO SELFIE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the history of photographic portraiture since the "invention" of the medium in the 1830s up to the present day. Particular attention is given to exploring the ways that identity is created, reinforced, or deconstructed through the limits and capacity of photography. How does photography transform the way identity is constructed through imagery in the early years of its history? How has photography shaped the formation of subjectivity in portraiture? In what ways does photography challenge or reinforce cultural and political hegemony by "representing" a person? How have digital photography and social media transformed the ways that an identity is constructed and shared by others? To answer these questions, examples of photo portraiture, from vernacular to artistic modes and spanning the globe, will be assessed. Each class will focus on theoretical debates on identity and subjectivity in relation to the given topic, with an interdisciplinary approach incorporating art history, cultural studies, critical theory, memory studies, postcolonial theory, and area studies. Student research will be presented as a final presentation and paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SYMBOLISM IN ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A symbol has its own story to tell and how it finds its way into man-made objects. The beauty of nature becomes a living poem that is inserted into a piece of art; weaved into a textile, or carved into a building. This course focuses on the meaning of symbols through different religions and cultures as well as in geographical locations. Through readings and lectures, students will learn how different types of symbols (geometric, vegetal and figural) can be used in their art &amp; designs. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam. No previous experience in symbolism in art and design are necessary or expected.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar addresses the intersection of contemporary photographic practices and critical theory. Readings by Walter Benjamin, Roland Barthes, Susan Sontag, Rosalind Krauss, Martha Rosler, Fred Richtin and others will provide a theoretical framework through which to examine a range of topics including:  conceptual art and photography, performance art, the documentary tradition, landscape and the body, postmodern 'anti-aesthetics' and appropriation, digital and archival practices, large-scale and tableau photography as well as the institutionalization of the medium in museums, higher education, and the art market. The class is structured around group discussions and is driven by student contributions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL VOCABULARY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class provides an introduction to contemporary art theory and its philosophical underpinnings.  Through critical readings in philosophy, literary theory, psychoanalysis, and art history, this course aims to familiarize students with the occasionally obscure, and sometimes blustery language of contemporary art.  Each class we approach a single term: such as "fetish," "neo-avant-garde" or "relational aesthetics;" or analyze dialogic pairings like "author/authority" or "origin/originality."  We examine the historical trajectories and philosophical underpinnings of these terms, charting their shifting and at times contradictory meanings. We also discuss some of the key texts of contemporary art in which these critical terms appear, and finally we consider what is at stake in the use of this critical vocabulary.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>JAPANESE AESTHETIC TRADITION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Despite the sudden and rapid Westernization during the latter part of 19th century, Japan has maintained its rich artistic and aesthetic traditions. Many arts with long history are still practiced and appreciated today, such as calligraphy, haiku, tea ceremony, flower arrangement, garden, martial arts, Noh theater, and Kabuki theater. More importantly, long-held aesthetic sensibilities regarding nature, human relationships, and life are still embodied in ordinary affairs today, such as cooking, packaging, etiquette, and designing of everyday objects and environments.  &lt;Br&gt; This course examines such legacies of traditional Japanese aesthetics by focusing on texts and arts before Westernization began and their cultural and historical context. In particular, we will explore how Japanese aesthetics is inseparable from ethical and existential considerations. &lt;br&gt;   (Please note that this course should not be taken by those who have already taken WS course on "Traditional Japanese Aesthetics," as there is a substantial overlap of the course content.) &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

It frames these issues in terms of the factors which force movements and restrict the movement of people across national boundaries. It considers both the causes and consequences of such movements in relation to legal, political, economic, social and cultural factors.  It looks at the images of citizen, nation and state that are constructed through the regulation of national boundaries, and compares these with the goals, identities and cultural processes of the people who move or are across regulated borders. In working out how to think about people who live at the edge of conventional social science categories we will reconsider such basic concepts as ethnicity, identity, nation, culture and homeland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Greek historian Thucydides wrote that knowing the past is useful for understanding the present because, so long as human nature remains the same, things that happened once "will recur in similar or comparable ways." The Greeks of the 6th century BCE began a systematic, critical inquiry aimed at making sense of the world around us and within us. This "Greek Enlightenment" was as revolutionary and had as far-reaching consequences as the subsequent European Enlightenment. We will examine history's first tumultuous passage from religious myth to scientific theory and philosophical argument. Readings will be drawn from Hesiod, the philosophers before Socrates, Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, Greek poets, dramatists, and historians.&lt;br&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Religion has long been a part of human life. Prehistoric burials include utensils and companions (sacrifice) for life in another world. Early writings pray for divine intercession or advise how to win divine favor.  Are beliefs such as these in survival after death and in supernatural beings reasonable?  Philosophy of religion asks this of these beliefs and others: Is belief based on experience (mysticism) and not argument reasonable?  Can the divine be proved to exist by argument, or proved not to exist (or care) by the prevalence of suffering?  Does the supernatural intervene in nature (miracles)? These and other questions will be examined through reading classic and contemporary writings, lectures, discussion, and student presentations.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SOCIOLOGY OF DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Technological change is often presented as a 'neutral' and 'dis-interested' set of processes that occur outside social, political and cultural processes rather than 'impacting' on 'society' and 'nature'. Much recent work in the sociology of technology has sought to contest this model suggesting that scientific and technological discourses are socially mediated in all kinds of power-laden ways. In this course, we will explore the contribution sociology can make to understanding the ongoing and dramatic changes occurring in the collision of technology, design, society and nature. We will begin by examining some central theoretical frameworks of technology studies variously inspired by the work of Marx and Heidegger, Foucault and Bookchin, Lash/Urry and Sennett; Latour and Haraway. We will move on to consider how these frameworks and related sociological literatures on consumption, commodification and the aesthetization of daily life might allow us to open up discussions about the sociology and politics of design. Finally, we will explore the history, culture and politics of various post-war, technology - inspired social movements from 'hackivism', 'sustainable design' and 'trans-humanism' which all share a commitment to re-designing social life and nature. Of central interest here will be to consider the relations between technology, design, citizenship and democracy and to reflect on the extent to which processes of technological change and design might be rendered more accountable, sustainable and reflexive.&lt;br&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEMINAR: LOOT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Loot? will study the history and analysis of the destruction of archaeological remains and cultural heritage by grave robbers, collectors, and museums. Why are the Elgin Marbles in London, and not on the Acropolis?  Why do there seem to be as many mummies in France as there are in Egypt? asks Sharon Waxman in her book Loot (2008). This seminar will examine the changing role of antiquities in the post-imperialist world, and access the moral and ethical questions raised by archaeologists, curators, collectors and lawyers regarding the plunder of ancient sites to feed an international art market.  We will also review legal standards regarding cultural properties (1970 UNESCO Convention,  1991 NAGPRA, and 1995 Unidroit Convention) and how they have impacted the protection of ancient archaeological sites, forced the return of many art treasures and lesser artifacts, and become big headaches for everyone involved in the preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN PHYSICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHILOSOPHY OF FOOD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The issues related to food and eating have been receiving much attention lately in our society and beyond, in response to growing concerns over our health and the environment. However, until recently, Western philosophy did not include those food-related issues in its discourse. In this course we will address a number of philosophical issues related to food and eating. (1) Why were food-related issues neglected in Western philosophy?  What are some of the consequences of such neglect?  What is the role of food and eating in other philosophical traditions? (2) What are some of the moral, political, and environmental issues involved in the production, distribution, and consumption of food?  For example, is there anything morally problematic about meat-eating? Do we have an ethical duty to feed the hungry in our society and other parts of the world? Is any form of the state's paternalistic intervention in people's eating habits an undue infringement on individual freedom?  What are the environmental costs of today's industrial farming, fishing, and global trade, what are some of the alternatives to reduce such costs, and are the alternatives successful?  Are there any problems regarding genetically modified organisms as a food source? (3) Some regard certain forms of cooking as art, but can food be art?  What are the aesthetic dimensions of food and eating? Can there be a standard of taste regarding food, or is it simply "a matter of taste"?  (4) Finally, what is the role of cooking and eating in a good life? Does food simply provide nourishment for our physical survival, or can it enrich our lives in other ways? Through studying a variety of materials and films, we will explore these and other issues related to food. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will examine many of the ethical, social and philosophical issues raised by ongoing developments in the brain sciences. With improved understanding of how the brain works comes new powers for understanding, monitoring, and manipulating human cognitive, emotional and behavioral functioning; such new powers have potentially profound implications for the law, social policy, clinical practice, and personal experience. Topics to be covered will include: moral judgment and decision making, freedom of the will, moral and legal responsibility, use of psychopharmacology for enhancement of mood and cognition, the neural basis of pro-social and anti-social behavior, neuroimaging and privacy, the use of neuroimaging data in courts of law (e.g., to assess truth-telling and the accuracy of memory), brain injury and brain death, the development of neurotechnologies, and the importance of ethical and social guidelines.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PSYCHOLOGY OF EVIL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evil has long been a topic of study for theologians and philosophers, but has only recently been studied by psychologists. Although evil is an inherently subjective topic, we will attempt to take an objective, scientific approach to understanding why people engage in evil behavior. Thus, we will begin by attempting to suspend the notion that we can divide the world into good and evil, and instead understand the situational and psychological factors that could lead anyone to harm others. Specifically, we will focus on classic psychological studies that show how everyday people can be led to act in deplorable ways by manipulating the situational circumstances. We will also discuss how inter-group processes can lead to conflict and large scale acts of violence like war and genocide. Finally, we will study the nature of the psychopathic personality in order to better understand those individuals who feel no guilt or remorse for harming others (e.g., brutal dictators and serial killers). This is a very interactive class and will require you to contribute in discussion and prepare an in-depth presentation on an area of your own interest related to the psychology of evil.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Evolution is the process by which living organisms change over generations of time.  This course examines how evolution occurs through natural selection, mutation, and genetic drift, beginning with the search for the origin of species (speciation) by artist-naturalists Charles Darwin, Alfred Wallace, and Henry Bates. Their observations of animal diversity (species variation, island geography, and mimicry) provided evidence for common descent within the animal kingdom, and led to the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection.  Studies of the fossil record paleontology yielded more evidence. Eventually, the genetic basis of evolution was explained by Gregor Mendel's discovery of heritable traits, later named genes.  Today, studies of evolution continue on a molecular scale with DNA and RNA (genomics) and proteins (protenomics).  Students will be graded based upon responses to study questions, participation during class discussion, performance on two written exams and a project on scientific visualization.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

If so, social psychology addresses these questions and many more. Social psychology is the science of how others influence the way people think, feel, and act. The aim of this course is to familiarize you with current and classic research and theory in social psychology, help you to develop critical thinking skills about social-psychological phenomena, and stimulate you to think about the implications of social-psychological research for everyday living.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIES OF ART, DESIGN, AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this seminar, we will take a social geographical approach to investigating a growing trend toward the merging of art and design - and the aestheticization of everyday life - with the social, economic, political and environmental interests of global capitalism. Additionally, we will explore forces within contemporary art, design and community practice that are resisting these trends; examples include a collaborative project involving artists, scientists, landscape designers and many thousands of citizens in "the production of capital" for soil remediation; the design of gaming that specifically draws on measured and predicted effects of climate change; a performance piece that draws equally from local knowledge, public health and medical expertise; and several art and/or design works, focused on justice, that take place on local/regional levels but intervene in larger global processes. Learning and applying concepts and methodologies of social geography (the study of social relations within specific spaces and places) to these conditions will help us gain the insight and understanding needed to evaluate the roles that art, design and community practice have and will continue to play in contemporary societies.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that humanity is changing Earth's environment and consuming natural resources at rates that are unsustainable.  These changes are more problematic or immediate for some regions or socioeconomic groups than others.  An understanding of the causes, magnitude, geography and time scales of environmental change prepares us to consider socially just and sustainable solutions, whether through design, analysis, communication, expression, or governance.  This course will focus on perceptions of environmental change arising from the so-called natural sciences: ecology, evolutionary biology, geology, oceanography, climatology.  Smaller portions of the course will consider environmental justice and the social consequences of histrionics in both climate activism and denialism. Course time will be divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and local field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will be an introduction to the vascular plant kingdom; its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips will facilitate the observation of plants in natural community assemblages, and will aid in students? understanding of similarities among plant families, as well as their adaptations to environmental conditions. Students will learn the Latin and English names of common species and learn to identify these plants through recognition of their unique morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Students will learn the importance of documentation for study and scientific record keeping and will create mounted specimens of plant species for the use of all students at the RISD Nature Lab. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN ECOLOGY: HOW WILDLIFE INTERACTS WITH URBANIZING LANDSCAPE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We frequently hear about animal (and plant) species that become common nuisances in urban areas, and we hear about how natural habitat loss leads to the disappearance of other species-not to mention the emergence of new diseases.  This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will introduce students to a variety of topics related to the nature of mind and the nature of language. We'll explore such questions as: What is the relationship between the mind and the brain?  Is there a conscious and an unconscious mind? Is it possible for a computer or robot to have a mind? Can animals think? What are the important characteristics of human language? Are human languages importantly different from animal communication systems? How do children acquire language? Are there important differences between male and female speech?  Readings will come from both the philosophical and the psychological literature.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LEADERSHIP OF SOCIAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Reflecting on historical and contemporary models of leadership, this course is designed to engage an active dialogue with the ways that collective social problems are both enabled and addressed by leaders. It also examines individual leadership potential by exploring how personal affinities can be focused and developed into effective strategies for solving problems, advancing ideas, and making change. Finally, it considers ethics, especially looking at the ways leadership can solve human problems. While primarily focused on public issues, this course will consider leadership in all economic spheres, and will look at the ways artists and designers practice leadership. In addition to reading, classroom discussion, and writing assignments, students will complete a community-based project in Providence. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will examine a number of controversies over various scientific, clinical, and social practices concerning mental illness. Topics include: classification and diagnosis (e.g, Is mental illness a myth?, Can mental health professionals distinguish normality from abnormality?, Is psychiatric classification useful?, Is there a gender bias in psychiatric classification?), the character of specific psychiatric conditions (e.g., alcoholism, depression, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), treatment issues (e.g., the psychotropic medication of young children, electroconvulsive therapy, suicide prevention), and social issues (e.g., the insanity defense, involuntary commitment, the duty to warn.)&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates admitted to RISD in 2008 or after. &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>War is endemic to human civilization.  To some it has been an opportunity for glory, to many more a source of horror.  What are some of the ideas and ideals that have precipitated wars? How has the way it has been experienced by both combatants and noncombatants changed over time?  What are the legacies of war?  War and culture have had a defining influence on each other, most evident in art, language, literature, popular culture, design, and constructs of virtue.  This course will examine current wars through the lens of past wars, notably the Spanish-American War and World War One, touching on such topics as nationalism, terrorism, liberation movements, and the cultures that inspired them.  Through required readings, individual research and writing, and classroom discussion, students will examine some of the experiences, impacts and artifacts of war through the cultural manifestations that attend them. There will be a field trip to a local military historic site.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Representations of gender in film, television, music, print media, and advertisements serve to inform us about the gendered system in which we live.  In addition to serving as a reflection of a given society's traditional gender roles and norms, mainstream media forms also shape the gender system by actively promoting specific gender stereotypes and ideals. By discussing scholarly literature and analyzing media representations of gender, we will try to understand how these media representations play a role in gender socialization, the political and economic status of men and women, our day to day interactions with others, and even our self-views. In addition to media that edifies traditional views of gender, we will also consider media that attempts to subvert the traditional gender system and promote alternative views of gender and sexuality.&lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The question, "What is the meaning of life?" is unclear in large measure because the word "meaning" is ambiguous.  The various ways "meaning" can be construed, both objectively and subjectively, in everyday life and in the philosophical arena will be explored. Literature, film, and philosophical texts will be used as vehicles to illuminate how reflection, experience, and transitions through life's stages influence assignment of value to one's existence.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most young people have developed their perspectives on the Vietnam War primarily through the medium of film. We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

Ideas from familiar phenomena help us see the connections between everyday life and the abstract ideas of physics. This non-mathematical presentation of optics leads us to an appreciation of the logic and beauty behind the behavior of light. Starting with the fundamental properties of light, we pass through the geometric optics of reflection and refraction, and the wave optics of interference and diffraction to the clarity of particle waves, lasers, holography, and special relativity.</COURSEDESC>

What functions do various parts of the brain support? In particular we will discuss the neural underpinnings of perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, emotion, social cognition, and decision-making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The idea of "value free science" has been appropriately abandoned as a false ideal.  In its wake there have arisen a number of questions concerning how social and moral values ought to play a role in determining the directions of scientific research, the conduct of such research, and the application of research findings to social problems.  In addition to examining such topics as scientific objectivity, scientific authority, sources of bias in science, and the social accountability of scientists, we will discuss several case studies including controversies over race and IQ, the safety and efficacy of psychiatric medications, the human genome project, and research concerning gender differences.  The course will consist of discussion of assigned readings, several short writing assignments, and a group research project and presentation.</COURSEDESC>

We will consider the political and cultural landscapes of 5th century BCE Athens, 19th century England, and 20th century United States. Students will read and discuss works from each period within its surrounding social context. In addition to dramatic texts, readings will include historical surveys of musical theatre and of the three periods. Students will be expected to produce two 3 to 5 page essays synthesizing the social issue about which a playwright/composer wrote with the resulting dramatic work; a mid-semester exam and a final project. Class meetings will include lecture, discussion and presentations. There will be a two-day field trip to New York to see musical plays and meet with theatre professionals. Lab fee covers theatre tickets, travel to and accommodation in New York. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SOCIOLOGY OF DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Technological change is often presented as a 'neutral' and 'dis-interested' set of processes that occur outside social, political and cultural processes rather than 'impacting' on 'society' and 'nature'. Much recent work in the sociology of technology has sought to contest this model suggesting that scientific and technological discourses are socially mediated in all kinds of power-laden ways. In this course, we will explore the contribution sociology can make to understanding the ongoing and dramatic changes occurring in the collision of technology, design, society and nature. We will begin by examining some central theoretical frameworks of technology studies variously inspired by the work of Marx and Heidegger, Foucault and Bookchin, Lash/Urry and Sennett; Latour and Haraway. We will move on to consider how these frameworks and related sociological literatures on consumption, commodification and the aesthetization of daily life might allow us to open up discussions about the sociology and politics of design. Finally, we will explore the history, culture and politics of various post-war, technology - inspired social movements from 'hackivism', 'sustainable design' and 'trans-humanism' which all share a commitment to re-designing social life and nature. Of central interest here will be to consider the relations between technology, design, citizenship and democracy and to reflect on the extent to which processes of technological change and design might be rendered more accountable, sustainable and reflexive.&lt;br&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of the modern Middle East (1800-present) and is designed to help students contextualize and understand political, economic, and social developments in the contemporary Middle East.  Composed of a mix of lectures and discussions, this course begins with a series of foundational lectures on important events and themes in Middle Eastern history prior to 1800 (such as the emergence of three monotheistic religions in the Middle East - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the rise, formation, and expansion of Islamic States in the early-modern period such as the Ottoman and Safavid/Persian Empires).  Moving quickly into the modern period, this course focuses in equal measure on the Arab Middle East, Iran, and Turkey.  The historical roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict are also addressed.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Utopianism and futurism - for better and for worse - have been discourses central to the evolution of modern design and indeed modern society. Through interrogations of critical moments in design history, engagement with debates in contemporary social theory and the use of case studies, this course will seek to explore the diverse roles that futurism and utopia play in contemporary society. We will consider how design utopianism and design futurism has played and continues to play a crucial role in attempts to legitimize and contest consumer capitalism.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing upon literary works to reconstruct and imagine urban life, this course focuses on the historical development of Istanbul - the capital city of the Ottoman Empire for 500 years and the largest and most important city in the Republic of Turkey today.  Economic, social, and cultural institutions, forms of entertainment, and communal relations that enriched daily life in Istanbul are addressed. This look at the pleasures of the city is counterbalanced by an examination of the vicissitudes of violence, disease, and natural disasters which ravaged the residents of Istanbul across the Ottoman centuries.  The last part of the class addresses the transformation and modernization of Istanbul in the nineteenth century and its place in the Republic of Turkey in the twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergradutes&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The role of place is central to the creative economy: industries emerge from geographic clusters, entrepreneurs improve their chances by relocating to innovative regions, and governments often pursue creative economies as a development strategy. But what makes a place 'creative'? How do creative economies contribute to regional development? And what roles should creative entrepreneurs play in our cities? This course examines the geographies of creativity: the political economy of creative industries, and the spatial characteristics of knowledge, innovation, and learning. The seminar considers scholarship on entrepreneurship, industrial and post-industrial development, the global economy of creative/design industries, and debates over 'creative cities' and 'learning regions'. The conversations and assignments focus on the potential for creative professionals and creative industries to contribute to community and economic development.</COURSEDESC>

This seminar will critically evaluate major perspectives in the debate, to understand how capitalist forms of economy function and why they lead to particular development outcomes. This is based on an examination of major theoretical concepts in political economy: concepts like crisis, ideology, innovation, the market, and value. We will examine major schools of thought through scholarly and literary texts: from classical debates surrounding figures like Adam Smith and Karl Marx to contemporary scholarship on post-industrial and advanced manufacturing economies, social entrepreneurship, green capitalism, and potential post-capitalist futures. The seminar will evaluate the evolving role of creative practice and entrepreneurship in and beyond capitalism.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMINIST THEORY AND ACTIVISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Some complain that feminist theory is "too academic," that it has no ties to social justice or activism. On the other hand, there are those in the academy who accuse gender/women's studies of not being sufficiently academic, of not being intellectually rigorous. With those two stereotypes in mind, we will read a variety of feminist theorists, some generally thought of as "academic," and some generally seen as "activist." Can academic theory be useful to political and social activists? Can activism inform academic theorizing?  With those questions in mind, we will look particularly at feminist theories and activism as they seek to counter, contextualize, and respond to war and other manifestations of violence; theories and activism around reproductive rights and justice; theories and activism addressing environmental justice and ecofeminism; and theories and activism around bodies and their relationships to the other issues we will examine. Throughout the course, we will keep in mind art's place within feminist theory and activism.</COURSEDESC>

For each area, we will first consider the anatomical structure, including the bones, muscles, nerves, arteries and veins. We will then study the function, including movement, systems and processes. Each area will be further explored through common injuries and syndromes with an anatomical basis, which are illustrative of function through dysfunction. We will discuss treatments with an anatomical basis, including typical surgical approaches and procedures, and the design of prosthetics. Through this course, we will demystify and develop an appreciation for the wondrous  complexity of the human body and its role in art and design. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course looks at Providence and its neighborhoods through the stories of people involved in making change happen.  It is designed to introduce students to processes of community engagement through the collection and presentation of oral histories.   Students will identify an individual or organization working on a project of interest to them and, through a series of oral history interviews, learn how individuals work to bring about change in complex economic, social, and cultural circumstance.  The course will focus on learning about community engagement and development, recording and editing oral history interviews with key players involved in change, and developing a final project based on these interviews that can contribute to the work of the organization or change agent.  It will involve the exploration of unfamiliar neighborhoods and issues, significant out of class work setting up and conducting oral history interviews, and close attention to the language people use to express themselves.  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as APPAR 2494 for Apparel majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO SHOEMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as APPAR 2494 for Apparel majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt;  This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor-- a defining constraint or liberating perspective?along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked:  ? Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival * Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity * Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business&lt;BR&gt;  The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  This course will consist of a series of lectures, readings and case studies from the Harvard Business School.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The aim of the course is to open a window on the complex and multifaceted present design environment. A preliminary overview about the major historic design movements will be followed by an extensive description of the design's state of the art together with a spot on the latest trends. Students will be invited to think and tinker, learning how to approach a design project, how to formulate proper research questions and how to use analog and digital prototyping to experiment, validate and communicate their own ideas. They will also initiate a dialogue with forms, functions, and interactions, defining the borders of the design activity and the actual role of designers. The main goal of the course is to get students familiar with the design vocabulary and with the basic tools involved in design processes.   &lt;br&gt; Areas covered: Ideas and concepts creation, quantitative and qualitative research, sketch models making, digital fabrication, physical computing, project's narrative and storytelling.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to ID Graduate Majors only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class will cover basic camera optics and lighting techniques necessary to generate high quality digital images for either print or digital portfolio applications. The focus of the class is to master manual controls on the digital camera such as film and shutter speed settings in conjunction with aperture openings to obtain whatever the desired effect might be to best represent two and three-dimensional objects. Manipulation of natural and artificial lighting is the other main focus of the class.  Students will learn the use of fill and bounce cards with sun, tungsten and strobe light sources. The emphasis will be on the strobe lighting studio where through a series of assignments students will learn direct, diffused reflected lighting techniques.   &lt;BR&gt;  Students will be required to participate in the final critique during the final week of the semester. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN FICTION-RAPID PROTOTYPING WITH TEXT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>There is an element of fiction in all design work and design is always about the future - it imagines the time when the objects and services we make become available to users - but design fiction goes further. Design fiction is a genre of experimental and speculative design that uses the tools and techniques of storytelling to develop conceptual prototypes of near future ideas.   &lt;BR&gt; Writing is cheap. It takes moments to describe an object that could take hours or months to build. This allows you to prototype ideas quickly, lightly testing and discarding so that only a much more promising subset of ideas makes it to the physical creation stage.  &lt;BR&gt; Drawing from the techniques of science fiction and the foresight community, we will explore how world and scenario-building can be used to enrich our designs. We will experiment with the tools of fiction and genre to examine our ideas from new angles and to find new ways of presenting our concepts to an audience. We will also consider the pitfalls and shortcomings of the approach.  &lt;BR&gt; At the end of the course, we will present a series of near-future prototypes for better living in strange new worlds.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEHIND THE SCENE(S): THE ARTIFICE, MECHANICS, CONTRIVANCES AND CRAFT OF THE SCENIC ARTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Stagecraft alludes to the design acumen, serious artistry and alchemy essential to visually suspend all disbelief in theatrical representations, notwithstanding the physical constraints of the stage and the hurried schedule of a production. This multiple atelier enterprise is handed down to us largely through a European operatic tradition where architectural, naturalistic and atmospheric settings are breathtakingly delineated on painted drops and heavily elaborated wood, muslin and plaster bas-relief which magically convey greater spatial depth-beyond the proscenium- than what is physically possible. Traditionally, it is the key visual conceit which psychologically differentiates the realm of the theatrical work from that of the audience.  &lt;BR&gt; This virtual boundary, eventually coined by Diderot as the fourth-wall, is analogous to the perspective picture plane-where the image of the scene is thrust forward to the eye of the observer. This optical illusion commonly known as the trompe-l'oil it is one of the underlying visual systems governing the spatial science of a desired scene. In reference to the immense scale of the operatic stage, a myriad of practical concerns are artfully managed to seamlessly interface with the visual concepts of the design, making this an appropriate paradigm for thinker-maker dynamics in the creative industries. Perceived tacitly as superficial installations, the stakes for the success of this artifice is quite high and problem solving must be considered in an interdisciplinary fashion. &lt;BR&gt; Given recent innovations in approach between design and fabrication in so many design and art disciplines, how might similar attitudes be applied for set design and the scenic arts without sacrificing the tradition of hand-crafted and painterly work? If the perspective trompe-l'oil was the visual technology that revolutionized the renaissance and baroque lyrical opera, what are the next innovations in stagecraft given this time-honored tradition?   &lt;BR&gt; This interdisciplinary course will encourage an oscillation between the roles of designers and artist, thinker and maker to manifest a forum to experiment with design ideas expressed in, drawing, models and painting in collaboration with the culture of the theatric arts. As a central thematic impetus, we will employ the traditional spatial conceit found commonly in the training of architects and painters: linear perspective and its geometric variants.  &lt;BR&gt; The syllabus, comprised of various workshops, will present concepts and techniques essential to the design and execution of a theatrical set. Through Bob Moody, Assistant Charge at the Metropolitan Opera, we will have accessibility to scenic shops and to its expertise. Furthermore, the course will support transport and attendance for performances as well as meetings/critiques with external technical advisors in consideration of the learning objectives of the course.  &lt;BR&gt; The class welcomes all Fine Art and Design majors who are encouraged to partake in an immersive 6 credit design studio that will combine three-dimension spatial concepts, drawing and painterly work at the scale of the theatrical stage. Given the nature of the course materials, exercises will vary dramatically in size and in scale from concept based maquettes to full scale mock-ups with material costs partially supported by the fund.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Magazines, newspapers and other publications rely heavily on pictures to illuminate messages initiated by writers, and more than any other genre of illustration, the editorial field gives voice to the artist. In this alternately reactive and expressive line of work, the illustrator engages in a powerful partnership with the written word, effectively becoming an author of opinions and ideas. This class will approach several editorial assignments, all of which involve an illustrated response to written text.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>A smile is recognition. Laughter is conspiracy.

Rather it will seek to provoke insights that are best expressed visually and verbally, as humor. Humor as the means, not the end, of the illustrative gesture. A funny-bone to pick.&lt;BR&gt; Assignments will include inversions of expectation, the uses of the inappropriate, the various guises of the satirical, of parody, single frame cartoons, black comedy. Wit. ("Wit" is merely insight made delightful). These will seek to elicit from the student a series of illustrations that will be as self-descriptive as any portfolio, as definitive as any 'style'. Humor is intensely idiosyncratic, personal. But when it 'works', when it achieves its audience, it is a particularly intimate and effective means of communication. In other words, illustration.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective: restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors only&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for juniors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING WITH COLOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Color is arguably the single most expressive and mysterious tool available to the artist. However, many artists who are skilled in black and white drawing have difficulty when they turn their hand to color. Crayon creates a bridge, which is at once less intimidating than more traditional media, while at the same time capable of producing highly sophisticated imagery. Through classroom exercises an awareness of the transformative power of color is awoken. Limited color underdrawings are further developed with multiple layers of color. The use of warm and cool color relationships as well as the exploration of polarities of color, in order to create rich, dramatic effects, is examined in depth.&lt;br&gt; Class work gives the student the opportunity to work from the live model.  For homework, the student is encouraged to engage in subject matter which has personal significance, perhaps something one had always wanted to create but hadn't had the opportunity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Throughout history, the natural environment has been a subject of charm and awe for the artist, from the delicately painted frescoes in ancient Roman homes to the 16th century, when the landscape transcended the role of 'background', and gained momentum as a sublime subject in its own right. This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Open to Non-Majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED DIGITAL PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital illustration has rapidly become commonplace or even standard in many art-related fields. As illustrators have moved into the digital realm, we find ourselves exploring traditional concepts of picturemaking with ever more complex software. Some software packages strive to mimic paint, ink and graphite, but these programs also give us the freedom to explore mark making in entirely different ways unavailable in traditional media, identifying digital programs as tools to reinforce traditional techniques of illustration.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration majors; non-majors welcome pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt;This course fulfills the computer literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to play is a complex activity that is at the core of human learning. From Monopoly to poker, Doom to the baseball diamond, games allow us to explore social interactions, take risks, set goals, develop skills and expand our imaginations while entertaining us without serious consequences. What makes a game fun? Or memorable? In this class, we will explore the intersections of learning, experimentation, and play. In our constructed projects, we will search for innovative ways to expand or reinvent game traditions. Through individual and collaborative projects, we will examine how game mechanics (rules/systems) thoughtfully combined with game aesthetics (visuals/story) can be used to craft engaging, memorable and informative user/player experiences. Our goal is to develop primarily non-digital games that are conceptually innovative responses to various questions you pose related to play. Quality assurance and usability concerns will be explored through focus group play tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to bring a creative project to a full and successful level of finish is often neglected in the academic environment, but is an essential professional skill. This course requires that students meet goals they set for themselves through individualized projects, but that they meet them fully with the highest degree of resolution and polish. In a written proposal, each student will present his or her project for the semester: a graphic novel, a series of paintings or drawings, a children's book, a suite of prints or posters. Work may be in any medium, in any format and on any theme, but these parameters must be clearly established at the outset. Work on the project will be conducted in the studio during class time and outside of class, and will be focused on full realization of a finished product that meets the specific standards established in the original proposal. Consistency and quality of execution will be the goal, and less successful or preliminary pieces will be re-worked to elevate them to the level of the project as a whole. Students will have one-on-one crits each week and group crits as needed. Finally, students will mount a professional-level juried exhibition of the completed projects in the ISB gallery, with an emphasis  on presentation, marketing and a public opening.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration seniors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Portraiture in oils doesn't simply begin and end with a likeness. In this class we will explore ideas and techniques employed by great painters since the Renaissance to create truly lifelike representations. We will begin with limited color underpaintings and thereby establish the basic image which frees us up to explore color through glazing. As the semester progresses we will move on to opaque painting techniques and finally to thickly applied paint using the palette knife. Emphasis is placed on color mixing and the use of a limited palette. We will examine how color can convey life and how this can be achieved through the use of subtle warm and cool color relationships.&lt;br&gt; Although the assignments are essentially figure and portrait related, the student is given great latitude in the choice of subject and how it is handled.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Since the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsheets" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a survey course designed to enable students to develop a wide body of work in three-dimensional moving art pieces. Students are exposed to a large range of types of movement and the challenges inherent in getting those movements to operate smoothly. The pieces are made from a wide range of materials, including but not limited to wood, cardboard, wire, metal, plastic, Sculpey, and paint. &lt;br&gt; There are three elements in each project: the idea, mechanism and surface treatment. Assignments will be given based on the mechanism. Students bring the subject and story to the piece. The mechanisms covered include: action/ reaction, balance/ counter balance, whirlygig, cams and cranks, motion-triggered lights and sound. Molds will be incorporated into the assignments. All projects are painted. &lt;br&gt; This course requires students to develop a working knowledge of a range of tools, from simple hand tools to more complex tools available in our wood shop. Exercises and focused workshops on tool usage will be a fundamental part of the class. Prior experience with tools is helpful but not necessary. &lt;br&gt; The class culminates with a "Come Play With Us" show of students' completed projects. Elementary school children and the RISD Community are invited to play with the pieces, with an emphasis on fun. The projects have to work; they need to be built to withstand all types of child's play.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to nonmajors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. &lt;BR&gt; Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed  for a public space or public interaction. The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912 and will receive 3 elective plus 3 LAEL credits. ILLUS major elective; non-majors will receive non-major elective&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Basic to all visual expression is the ability to articulate what one sees.  Skill and sensitivity in drawing are the essence of such articulation. The object of this course will be to develop the student's skill as a draughtsman, to make the hand a more gifted servant of the eye.  High competence is not a prerequisite for this course; commitment is.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO OIL PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Oil painting is one of the richest, most powerfully expressive mediums that exist.  It offers a vast diversity of approaches and provides the most flexibility of all the painting materials. To take advantage of that variety, certain technical knowledge is essential. This class is geared as a thorough introduction to the newer oil painter. Our early class focus will be on understanding materials through a variety of life study exercises. Focus on color and composition will promote effectively orchestrated images. Our ultimate goal will be to make powerful images that marry appropriate approaches to oil painting with personal vision. The class emphasis will balance the technical mastery of materials with the clarity of effective visual communication.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we examine gender -- not your biologically assigned equipment, but those social constructs that shape and define what is male, what is female and what is that less absolute space between and beyond. Weekly assignments often begin by reviewing the traditional role of women and men in American culture but through a contemporary lens, examining the astoundingly colorful range of gender and sex identities that cannot be limited to simply pink and blue. We'll turn stereotypes inside out, flip popular icons upside down, and rework familiar images from hallowed museums. We'll search for fresh depictions of abstract concepts like conception, contraception, relationships, power, etc. This course offers equal opportunity for XX's, XY's and those outside the binary..&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for juniors&lt;BR&gt; Restricted to Illustration majors, Junior and above during Fall and Spring&lt;br&gt; Open to everyone during Wintersession&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to merge imagery from various sources is an essential skill for illustrators and fine artists alike.  In a series of projects, students will gather sketches, drawings and photographs, and combine them to exist solidly and convincingly together in space.  We will discuss the importance of lighting, color, and value in creating a believable scene, and explore the methods and techniques used by illustrators and painters past and present.  Class time will be divided between the computer lab (where students will manipulate their images using Photoshop and other tools) and the studio, where illustrations and paintings will be completed using a variety of media, including pen and ink, watercolor, and acrylic paint. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Restricted to Illustration Majors, Junior and above, during Fall or Spring. Non-majors by permission during Add/Drop. &lt;BR&gt; Open to all during Wintersession, when offered. &lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;Br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is meant to give students an understanding of the process of serigraphy.  Using the basic American T-shirt as the format, emphasis will be on creating and developing a concept: learning and implementing the techniques of silk-screen in order to produce wearable illustration.  The course will also include historical and contemporary issues on the phenomenon of the printed shirt, i.e., uses ranging from social protest to advertising and the use of the body as a substrate for images.  A variety of techniques will explore everything from simple handmade stencils to the use of photo/computer technology to create individual designs.  Assignments will be given through the developmental phase, and in-class critiques will play an important role in determining the final product.  By the end of the semester, students will also investigate the business/commercial side of silk-screening, including at-home studio setup, recordkeeping and selling the product.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Weekly assignments combine illustration objectives with a playful spirit of exploring materials for its own sake. Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.   &lt;BR&gt; Techniques with paper pulp, polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (as low-relief and over armatures). Scavenged objects and supplies to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations are another way to create images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished with mixed media, collage and other treatments that unify the whole. Idea and technique come together so these illustrations will be anything but shallow.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING II: THE ARTICULATE FIGURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from slow, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from slow, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING II: OBSERVATION AND IMAGINATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will continue the study of color organization and use of the oil medium begun in the fall semester, with increased emphasis on compositional structure and adjustment. Assignments will feature imaginative or hybrid compositions, combining observed and invented components. Using principles of color, directional light and spatial structure to solidify atmospheric unity, we will explore the implication and construction of narrative.  Work in class will solidify the student's ability to evoke volume, space and light.  We will examine the breadth of creative choice in representational color use to illuminate the expressive qualities of various options. &lt;BR&gt;   Students will study the role for color in directing the viewer's navigation of a composite subject, or imbuing a simple image with depth and complexity. Color design is introduced as an abstract structure that underlies figurative imagery, providing an important expressive subtext. Quick compositional studies in casein or gouache of a work in progress will be used to focus atmospheric and spatial effect. The historical development of  color use in painting and cultural associations of style will be explored in slide lectures and experimentation.   &lt;BR&gt; A capstone assignment will tie the principles of color and composition to a large narrative painting combining diverse imagery from reference and imagination, and emphasizing clarity and subtlety of structure in service of personally determined content.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is visual communication: meaning made visible. Visual thinking, the creative process by which all successful illustration is created, constitutes the development of an articulate imagination through thorough, iterative exploration of ideas. This class emphasizes process over finish, idea over application and significance over style-exploring both ways of seeing and ways of showing. Coursework will encourage conceptual invention and application fundamental to an understanding of what the practice of illustration is and can be. The object of the course is to strengthen the students' inventive talents and interpretive skills - and thereby to augment their ability to articulate complex ideas with clarity, eloquence and power.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. Registration by Illustration department, course not available via web registration. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING I: VISUALIZING SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING I: COLOR PERCEPTION AND EXPRESSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>PHOTO ONE: DIGITAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is an introductory course in digital photography. It covers all the basic techniques of digital workflow: capture, photo editing, and inkjet printing. You will learn how your camera works and how to control it to get the results you want. You will also learn how to download and manage your image files, edit them for best results, backup them religiously, and make excellent inkjet (digital) prints. Beyond technique, there will be at least one visiting artist, regular lectures covering the history of photography, an optional weekend field trip to Boston, and regular group and individual crits geared toward developing your style, focusing your ideas, and making better pictures. Most students use a DSLR (digital single-lens-reflex) camera, which you must provide, but other types are also OK, such as a good point-and-shoot or an ILC (interchangeable lens compact) model. We will discuss cell and tablet phones, but a dedicated camera such as one of the above models, will give you better results and more control. While this course is an introduction to photography, and assumes no prior knowledge, students with some photography background or those with analog-only experience may also benefit. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Illustration major elective; open to non-majors  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MYTH AND METAPHOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the words of Joseph Campbell, "Myth is metaphor."  Just as the world's most enduring stories and significant cultural traditions spring from collective human experience and are given compelling shape by imagination, so is art a metaphor for collective consciousness.  This class brings together the study of myths, legends and folklore with the visual rhetoric of the illustrator, as we seek a variety of forms of expression and visual narrative in telling  great stories from mythology, legend and folklore. Whether in the form of contemporary urban legends or ancient mythic themes shared across cultures and time, we will examine the phenomenon of myth as metaphor for the human experience and art as a vital element in its expression. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STEREOTYPES AND PARADIGMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>  Picture-making for broad public consumption is extraordinarily dependent on rote comprehension of longstanding archetypes. Heteronormative, Anglocentric, Caucasian and male-oriented paradigms prevail in western culture, and our collective habit of perpetuating these hierarchies in illustration, while undoubtedly useful in the conveyance of messages through a quick read, runs counter to more noble efforts to promote parity of race, gender and sexual orientation through equal representation in visual culture.  &lt;BR&gt;   This class explores the merits and frustrations of inclusiveness in illustration-an art form uniquely skewed to wide scale appreciation of archetypal personae. Students will commit themselves to equal representation for a broad spectrum of people (e.g., race, sexual orientation, gender) while confronting the very practical problems inherent to overcoming our dependence on default personae (white, straight, male) to communicate abstract ideas. How can illustrators achieve clarity of communication while putting aside prevailing stereotypes? What is the responsibility of the perceiving public in transcending habitual interpretation in favor of equal representation? These and other questions are at the heart of this class. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;BR&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts Requirement for Illustration majors. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated  manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. We study Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with a critical brief to be handed in upon exiting the class. Additionally there are weekly readings, 2 tests, and one long and one short research paper. There is no textbook for this class. However, students will be able to access study images and readings through Artstor and on RISD Digication.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Course Level: Sophomore, required and restricted to Illustration majors&lt;br&gt;  Fee: TBD &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VOICE + VISION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Writing and image-making are both important languages to process and communicate personal ideas and experiences with immediacy.  How can they be used most fruitfully together?  In this class, we will examine the relationship between the voice and vision of the artist-writer through a series of projects that intertwine written and visual communication. Projects may include image-making which is stimulated by writing (or vice-versa), blogging and visual journalism for the artist-writer, as well as creative writing projects which consider a significant visual element.  We will look to Artist's Books and notebooks, developments in literature, blogs, and on-line communications.  Students will be encouraged to mine areas of personal interest in the development of a body of work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3-D ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While most illustrations are flat, working in three dimensions allows for the engagement of a whole new range of material and conceptual possibilities. Whether using plaster, Sculpey, paper clay, wood, latex, fabric, foam or found objects, sculptural materials are enormously nuanced in what they can suggest. In this class we will examine how objects and various sculptural strategies can be used to convey complex concepts and ideas.  A survey of contemporary sculpture and 3D illustration will provide plenty of conceptual, process and material inspiration.&lt;BR&gt;  Projects are structured to introduce you to a variety of materials and methods of working. Character design, model-making, casting, and work with found objects are some of the areas we will explore. A visit to the Rapid Prototyping facility at RISD will illuminate how digital files can be translated into 3D objects. Additionally students will learn how to light and photograph three-dimensional work for reproduction or portfolio. The class promotes development of personal expression, strong conceptual solutions, excellent craftsmanship and good design.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt; Fee: TBD &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURING SOUND: MUSIC + ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration, along with painting, printmaking and many other visual art practices, is continually intertwined with music. From illustrators collaborating on videos, packaging and promotion, to creating graphic novel and picture biographies of musicians and musical movements, the tradition of connecting the visual to the acoustic has a rich history. &lt;BR&gt;   Music will always need to be celebrated larger and in a more tactile way than on a screen-we are seeing the enduring inventiveness of the gig poster, and even the 12" LP cover is still alive as a canvas. Projects in this class will explore promotional, interpretive, and investigative approaches as they relate to musicians, lyrics and titles, as well as parallels between music and visual art. Students will have the chance to interpret musical works in a number of ways, including through narrative approaches, using sculpture, animation and GIFs, and other less conventional means.  &lt;BR&gt; There will be exploration of analogous aspects of music and visual art-sound and color, time based works, performative aspects and related ideas (e.g.: the movements of the hand while drawing/painting as analogous to playing an instrument). There will be some focus too, on genres and movements where music and art have close relationships, ie: psychedelia, pop and op art, comics and set design.  Lectures and discussion will also be devoted to learning about artists who create both visual and musical work.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PORTRAITURE AND PERSONA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores portraiture and its roles within illustration, as well as in painting and other practices. &lt;BR&gt;   From celebratory to sharply satirical, portraits of political leaders, celebrities and cultural figures have a conflicted history, and these representations have been powerful tools for good and ill. In an editorial context, the portrait is an opportunity to engage the visual language of that history and bring one's own views of the subject into focus. &lt;BR&gt; This class will examine uses of exaggeration, the importance (or not) of likeness, and working with the visual vocabulary that the subject brings along with them. There will also be investigation of utilizing specific materials and visual styles to enhance concepts.  &lt;BR&gt; Attention will also be given to more experimental approaches-invented portraits, incorporating photography and collage, combining live and imaginative drawing, and the intent to communicate psychological states and other ideas, rather than solely the depiction of specific individuals.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The long tradition of illustrative reporting will be examined and discussed, as will the contemporary manifestations of journalistic art in print and in digital formats.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of western illustration from illuminated  manuscripts through approximately 2000 AD. The work shown is culled from a vast cache of artistic production for its power to convey ideas and ideals, report and editorialize events or serve as an enhancement to literature. We consider how evolving technologies in printing and communication have influenced artistic processes, shaped aesthetics and facilitated the distribution of illustration. We study Illustration's role in reflecting and influencing culture, and its variable relationship to fine art. Each session includes a lecture to which students respond with a critical brief to be handed in upon exiting the class. Additionally there are weekly readings, 2 tests, and one long and one short research paper. There is no textbook for this class. However, students will be able to access study images and readings through Artstor and on RISD Digication.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Course Level: Sophomore, required and restricted to Illustration majors&lt;br&gt;  Fee: TBD &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENTREPRENEURSHIP STUDIO FOR ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will allow students to understand, celebrate, and employ their creative processes in a collaborative studio environment that helps them understand how their artwork becomes commercially viable and the value of design thinking in wider field. The course combines the experiential work of a studio with the conceptual learning of business basics: business models, customer understanding, finance, marketing and branding, elements that are essential parts of the creative process that drives design forward.  &lt;BR&gt; This class encourages students to harness creative thinking, take it off the page and put it to new use. In the studio students will work collaboratively toward the goal of employing inventive thinking in the workplace, be it thinking entrepreneurially within a job environment and/or eventually develop an independently owned and operated enterprise. &lt;BR&gt; A fundamental objective of this class is for students to put to use, in the studio, basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design thinking overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how creative skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.  Students will be introduced to basic business concepts through the co-requisite course, Entrepreneurial Concepts and Principles  (NMEL-3508) Studio assignments spring from the classroom pedagogy. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Illustration elective &lt;br&gt; Open to juniors and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ENTREPRENEURIAL CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Entrepreneurship, the imagining, building and sustaining of a socially impactful organization, is a creative art. Beyond self-awareness and purpose, entrepreneurial success requires insights from the humanities and social sciences as well as knowledge from the physical sciences; and the premise of this lecture course is that designers and artists are uniquely gifted with critical entrepreneurial qualities. This course will allow students to better understand how and where their skills and perspectives fit into the world of entrepreneurship and business through interdisciplinary study.&lt;BR&gt;  The objective of this course is for students to understand basic business vocabulary and how the processes and sensibilities of creative expression complement and enhance entrepreneurial thinking and processes. The goal is for students to understand how creative expression can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.  &lt;BR&gt; The course will use case studies, business articles and recent books on business to highlight this thinking.   Students will be introduced to basic business concepts through lectures, analysis of case studies, written assignments and class discussion. Homework assignments will work to reinforce and expand the classroom pedagogy. Topics covered will be business models, marketing, finance, and strategy. &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt; Illustration juniors and above &lt;br&gt;  As a co-requisite class, the concepts and frameworks above will be applied in Entrepreneurship Studio for Illustration (ILLUS- 3508) through a series of art and design projects. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN THESIS PREP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Design Thesis in the department of Interior Architecture is conceived as a three part sequence beginning with "Investigating Interiority", now positioned in the Spring semester of the penultimate year of the MDes program.  Building on the theorectical understandings obtained during that prerequisite course, this semester is designed to assist students to identify a suitable thesis project. The discussions will refer to important precedents, many of which will have been identified during the earlier course.  The students will be required to submit their proposals for their own self-choice design project. Through group discussion and individual interviews, outline proposals will be approved in principle, requiring each student to prepare a feasibility report for their proposed Design Thesis. The design phase will take place during the following Spring semester.  The completed feasibility report will be submitted for evaluation at the end of the Fall semester.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement:MDes&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Interior Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the major designers working in the period 1850 to the present.  Areas of study will include an examination of design related issues that will be studied in the context of their social, political, technological, and economic circumstances, as they pertain to the design culture of the period. Special emphasis will be given to the history of interior interventions, additions and renovations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt; Other areas of study will include the development of architectural drawing and other presentation media, and the way in which designs often evolved through committees, or ongoing consultations among the patrons, designers, administrators, and scholars. Attention will also be given to design theory, and the doctrines relating to site, orientation, proportion, decorum, and the commercial design market.&lt;BR&gt; A general background in the history of Art and Design is desirable but is not mandatory. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for BFA&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;BR&gt; Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is primarily intended to provide some insight into the design objectives of the studio projects of the undergraduate and graduate degree programs of Interior Architecture at RISD.  As a studio introduction to Interior Architecture for non-majors, the course will focus on the spatial design concerns of the department focusing on how one carves, creates and occupies built space. Projects will explore the realm of work that begins with an architectural volume and transforms it from the ill-used or obsolete, to new purpose and viability, presented in drawings and models.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio focuses on creating space as a total environment to convey information - and experience books, literature and knowledge in a new and compelling, possibly even spiritual way. In this project typography and architecture will intersect.  &lt;br&gt; The site is within the second floor of the Providence Public Library's historic wing. In this memorable setting, the student's intervention should create a new, rejuvenated sense of space - one where the present and the past are in a dialectical relationship and where each amplifies the value and quality of the other.   &lt;br&gt; Space, structure and typography should fuse into an inseparable unity in the inserted volume. Students will integrate the written word with the erected forms using both traditional methods along with more experimental digital technology.  &lt;br&gt; The final project should form a space of repose, an ambiance fostering a different exposure to and immersion in knowledge that inspires new ways of thinking and feeling.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;  Open to All Grads&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY IN 3D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The use of typography in the 3D space is a compelling one. With both a strong formal dimension and an informational function, typography will provide a coherent program with a real sense of order. If it is applied with a comprehensive system, this sense of unity allows for better communication. The typography display in the space is built with different parts related to one another by a system. In order to understand the nature of a very well organized typographic program, our point of view must be fundamentally structural. Such an approach allows us to discern the sophisticated underlying relationship between parts which creates a sense of wholeness.  &lt;BR&gt; This Cross-disciplinary course will offer the students of Interior Architecture and Graphic Design the opportunity of working with typography in 3 Dimensional Space.&lt;BR&gt;   Students will apply the use of proportion, hierarchy, and legibility in two aspects of the 3D space: A Wayfinding project and a Museum Exhibition. &lt;BR&gt;   The course will explore the methodology required to work with typographic systems in the 3 Dimensional environment, applying the narrative aspect of information. Specific attention will be devoted to exploring the methodology of designing in different scales and the ability to translate 2 dimensional content to a 3 Dimensional display. Studies will include setting text in small and big scales, the use of grids, and the application of a comprehensive system.   &lt;BR&gt; This course will be concerned with the process which controls the structure and properties of applying big scale typography and further students understanding of how applying information typographically can challenge a space. &lt;br&gt; Through formal, geometric, and spatial analytic processes, students will build systems with two considerations: The interdisciplinary planning and design process between an Architect and a Graphic Designer as well as the application of a Sign System within the Adaptive Reuse project. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;  Also offered as GRAPH 3198. Register in the course for which credit is desired.  Major elective, INTAR majors only, others with permission of instructor &lt;br&gt; Open to seniors, graduate students &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This will involve expanded reading, group discussions, testing of typology studies, further conceptual development and a writing component . The seminar should conclude with a booklet and a common exhibit proposal representing a holistic proposal of a given topic. This seminar will work in conjunction to the final studio where all senior students from different advanced studio groups will meet, discuss their projects with their peers and work on individual basis with the instructor on above outlined topics. UG Students in their final year will have the opportunity to expand their final design investigation to a holistic project, create a final book and present the work in a final Department exhibit.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement, INTAR senior majors only&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Several guest lecturers make presentations throughout the semester about personal and professional experiences. The final thesis requirements are a written thesis document, curriculum vitae, artist statement, and twenty professional photographic images. The resulting body of thesis work is featured in the Graduate Exhibition at the RISD Museum in May. It is expected the &lt;i&gt;Graduate J+M Thesis&lt;/i&gt; investigation yields uncharted results, reflects unique perspectives, and reveals high levels of execution.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The fall seminar concentrates on critical reading as an opportunity to locate, examine, and discuss your work within a broader field of inquiry. The additional objectives are to increase critical thinking, hone reading and writing skills, expand vocabulary, and build presentation skills. Woven into all of this is the understanding that research can be a valuable, if not essential, component of making - each informing and enriching the other. The focus of the spring seminar shifts to writing and presentation as an integral part of both studio and professional practice. Each spring brings a new team of guest instructors who introduce various modes of writing as a means to mine, develop and articulate ideas in a concise and authentic manner, and, to further hone that information into artist statements, written theses, and public presentations. Throughout the term writing will be the vehicle in which to move between private and public realms. This journey will begin with 'automatic writings' and culminate with your public artist presentations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Senior J+M Degree Project students focus on a clearly defined, individually chosen, subject of inquiry for 12 weeks. Seniors are required to take full responsibility for the evolution and articulation of their creative practice. Two faculty serve as DP advisors, meeting weekly with students, to discuss and facilitate the progress of their work. Writing exercises are incorporated into the class to support the relationship between writing and their studio practice. Although seniors must be self-reflective in identifying the individual impulses and motivations in their work, emphasis in review and discussion begins to shift from the voice of the personal to that of the greater collective, context, and role of the audience. The DP culminates in an exhibition at Woods-Gerry Gallery on the RISD campus. Graduation requirements include: CV, professionally documented digital portfolio, artist postcard, and artist/degree project statement.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department; course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

   <COURSETITLE>*TURKEY: MAPPING ISTANBUL: PEOPLE OBJECTS, IMAGES, SPACE AND TIME: SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course and its co-requisite (NMSE-1518-01) introduces students to patterns and connections in the social life and material culture of Istanbul - from past to present - through artifacts, architecture, design, environments, literature, people and spaces. The cross-disciplinary nature of this Studio + Liberal Arts course offers rigorous visual, critical and experimental inquiry focused in a historical and cultural framework with the benefit of site-specificity. Input and participation from students of ALL levels of the college and from ALL departments are desired.  	 &lt;BR&gt; For more than three millennia, the city of Istanbul has been a crossroad from East to West, North to South, and old to new. Although its strategic location straddling Europe and Asia has resulted in historic (and contemporary) conflicts between differing political, religious and economic interests, the ability of the citizens to absorb and adapt has allowed them to endure, resulting in a rich synthesis of ideologies, styles and practices. We will witness these layers of civilization through materials, structures and spaces and social situations that reveal transitions throughout Istanbul's history. As such, the city will be our laboratory for observing how humans continue to interact with places, things and ideas while providing an invaluable context for art, design, technology and social theorizing.  	 &lt;BR&gt; Following an aggressive schedule that will fuse studio practices and research components, this course includes lectures, readings, discussions and studio activity combined with extensive foot, bus, and ferry navigation of the many neighborhoods of Istanbul. A final studio-based project that grows from sketchbook, journal and other recorded observations will be executed in conjunction with a written, research component. Both elements of the final project will be considered for relevancy, cohesiveness and contextualization of the student's research topic. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Travel Costs: $3,700.00 - $4,500.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Corequisite: NMSE-1581 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed for beginners in Italian and provides an introduction to the basic structures of the language and to Italian culture. Throughout the course, situations that often represent obstacles to newcomers to Italy are presented to assist students in learning how to immerse themselves into a new country and a new culture. Vocabulary and grammar are presented through teaching materials-including listening comprehensions, and the reading of Italian texts-which refer to situations relevant to the students' experience in Italy.  The study of the Italian language is integrated with an overview of contemporary Italian culture through films, music and lectures that deal with cultural topics. Students will be asked to perform role-plays, street assignments and discussions in order to enable them to speak and interact in Italian. Students are expected to participate actively in the class discussions and activities, and to contribute with suggestions, ideas and presentations &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open only to students studying in Rome in the RISD EHP Program&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Rhode Island, the second most densely populated state in the nation, has a history of environmental problems that include overfishing, salt marsh degradation and deforestation from agriculture, and soil and water pollution from the textile and jewelry industry. Its flora and fauna include introduced species as well as nearly extinct ones. Its 35 islands and 400 miles of tidal coastline are subject to rising sea levels from climate change. This 3-credit course is designed to give students the laboratory skills needed to study how humans impact ecosystems at both a micro- and macro-biological level, using the Nature Lab as the base of operations, and Rhode Island as an example. Scientific disciplines and techniques covered will include biochemistry, cell biology, parasitology, microscopy, specimen collection, genetics, zoology, botany, ecology, and GIS mapping. Teaching and learning methods will include lectures, labs, field trips, written responses to weekly readings, discussions, and a final project. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>REBIRTH OF MODERNITY: NEW KNOWLEDGE, New Worlds, and Renaissance England</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The world was becoming a very different place in the 16th Century.  The Protestant Reformation, continental wars of religion, transatlantic colonial expansion, and the emergence of new scientific paradigms profoundly affected the complex of ideas that had presided in Europe since antiquity.  The scope of the transformation was broad, but in this course we will examine closely the influence of two Italian thinkers (Giordano Bruno and Niccol Machiavelli) on late Elizabethan poets Edmund Spenser, Christopher Marlowe, and William Shakespeare.  Bruno was busily rethinking the elemental order of the universe; Machiavelli had redefined the nature of the state and the operations of power.  Each was controversial in England for very different reasons, but also prompted a thorough reimagining of the order of things among young British writers of the day.  Among the texts we'll read are: Bruno's Italian dialogues (written and published in London); Machiavelli, selections from The Discourses on Livy and The Prince; Spenser, Shepheardes Calender and Faerie Queene; Marlowe, The Jew of Malta, Tamburlaine, Dr. Faustus; Shakespeare, Hamlet, The Tempest.  There will be regular short writing assignments in response to readings, an independently researched project and a final exam. Students will also be responsible for consistently informed engagement in class discussions. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HAWTHORNE AND HIS FEMALE CONTEMPORARIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Nathaniel Hawthorne (1804 - 1864), famous (or infamous) for dismissing the American female novelists of his time as a "d---d mob of scribbling women" and as "ink-stained Amazons," had a more complicated connection with his female contemporaries than these labels insinuate.  By reading some of Hawthorne's texts side by side with writings by some women of the nineteenth century, we will study the texts' thematic and stylistic interconnectedness.  This study will help us develop a more informed assessment of the nature of Hawthorne's relationship with the "scribblers" of his time.  Of special importance will be a consideration of what being an artist in nineteenth-century America meant to both Hawthorne and his female contemporaries.  This topic will lead into the maze of psychological, philosophical, and sociological issues significant in Victorian American culture, remnants of which persist in our culture today.  We will read texts such as Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter and The Blithedale Romance, Alice Cary's Clovernook Sketches and Other Stories, Margaret Fuller's Woman in the Nineteenth Century, Rebecca Harding Davis's Life in the Iron Mills and Other Stories, and the poetry of Emily Dickinson.  Students will write journal entries and two papers and take a final exam.  Those who have completed all assignments and have at least a B average will have the option of constructing a final project (written or written and visual) instead of taking the final exam.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WRITING, REVELATION, REVOLUTION: MAGICAL REALISM AS POST-COLONIAL DISCRS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Long associated with the experimentations of Latin American writers like Gabriel Garca Marquez and Alejo Carpentier, magical realism today has a global presence, and has been given an important place in the literatures of countries as diverse as India, Nigeria and Canada.  Perhaps because of this broad popularity, it is also often criticized as overly commercialized, exoticized fluff.  Yet its endurance as a model in both literature and the arts also suggests that it continues to offer an important way for writers to differentiate themselves from and critique mainstream culture, to give voice to marginalized realities in the wake of the homogenizing power of globalization and the mass media.  This course is organized around the following three goals: 1) to arrive at an understanding of what the term "magical realism" means by looking at the early writers and texts that made it world-renowned; 2) to examine a range of writers from different cultural contexts and regions, both inside and outside the Americas; 3) to analyze their work as it uses (and re-invents) the conventions of magical realism to make pointed political commentaries.  We will read fictional texts and essays and view a number of films and discuss how they link a magical realist aesthetic to a particular experience of land, history, family, and culture, in particular the folk, indigenous, and buried cultures and histories that challenge the "rationalism" of the northern urban centers. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>A BLOODY MESS: THE CRITICAL VALUE OF HORROR FILMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The horror genre has long been devalued as an art form, considered a source of cheap thrills and perverted voyeurism. In this class, however, we will take an in depth look at this film genre to understand its continuing appeal and critical value as a signifier of social anxieties and cultural critique. Studying a variety of films across the decades and several countries we will ask questions about cinematic development, viewer psychology, race, gender, sexuality, class, youth culture, and consumerism. By the end of the class, I hope we will decide that the "bloody mess" in horror films exposes society's deepest fears and anxieties about what really might be going bump in the night. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

You will be spending 11 weeks with one particular book with the intent to create a "transgendered" version by identifying and imagining all the ways through which a body can be added to, subtracted from, and generally modified in service of an authentic self that has been embedded, misplaced, mourned, repressed, or otherwise dispossessed.  Such a project necessitates thinking about the book as flesh.  You will be asked to develop an intimacy with the book that will allow you to give it a different and differently true contours. &lt;br&lt;  &lt;i&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These short prose pieces draw from both fiction and poetry, yet they are finally neither, another literary beast altogether.  As befits a hybrid form, this will be a hybrid course.  We will survey notable works in the development of the prose poem and short-short story with an eye toward what the form has become today.  We will respond to this material through short analytical essays as well as prose poems and short-short stories of our own.  Through discussion of published work and workshops of our own writing we will gain a clearer insight into what this strange, playful form can do.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: 'FROM MACONDO TO McONDO": THE BOOM AND BUST OF THE LATIN AMERICAN NOVEL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Associated for many years with the exoticism of magical realism (el boom), the Latin American novel has turned to the gritty realism of urban settings shaped by mass media and global corporate capitalism (McOndo).  In this course we will examine the political and cultural meaning of this shift in literary styles and focus.  The course begins with a short overview of magical realism to set the stage for our subsequent discussions.  The majority of the class, however, is dedicated to an examination of the contemporary writers and sub-genres that constitute the McOndo movement, including the noir crime novel, the crack generation, and the postmodern novel of biculturalism.  Authors may include: Alberto Fuguet, Giannina Braschi, Ignacio Padilla, and Paco Ignacio Taibo.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>When you are sitting on the bus reading &lt;i&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/i&gt;, the act of reading becomes a performance: the particular cultural exchange value of this novel has the effect of feminizing your body, no matter what its biological makeup.  This is the work of a genre of fiction we call "Chick Lit."  With playfulness and rigor, this seminar will take up the mechanism of this genre into a feminist and theoretical content.  Hlne Cixous, Hortense J. Spillers, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and Avital Ronell represent a group of feminist thinkers who have used fictionality in the craft of writing theory.  Studying these and other feminist theorists, we will delve into the functionality of fiction as gendering device by focusing on the craft of theorizing as a craft of fiction writing.  What are the ways in which theory can function as fiction?  What are the points of intersection between writing theory and writing fiction that can be used productively for the constitution of not just a feminine body, but a feminist consciousness?  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING POETRY WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Beginning Poetry Writing Workshop focuses on the creation and appreciation of works of literature; the education of students in diverse traditions of poetry writing, performance, publication, and scholarship; and discovery and innovation in the literary arts.  Although students at all levels of undergraduate and graduate study can take the course, our commitment is to beginning a practice in poetry and sustaining it for a period of twelve weeks, and perhaps beyond.   In this course, students will establish a writing practice, develop and articulate a poetics (your commitments as a poet), write a collection of poetry, perform and publish poems, and curate and produce events and/or publications.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will provide students with a foundation in the major movements, debates, and thinkers of 20th- and 21st-century critical theory. We will begin from both Marxist and psychoanalytic engagements with semiotics, visuality, mass media, sexuality, and representation. Proceeding through structuralism and post structuralism, we will examine the important contemporary debates about the individual's relationship to identity, aesthetics, power, history, technology, and the lived environment taking place in recent feminism, queer and postcolonial theory, and eroticism.  No previous familiarity with critical theory is required. Critics will include Marx, Freud, Lacan, Foucault, Benjamin, Lukacs, Adorno, Barthes, Derrida, Althusser, Crary, Baudrillard, Butler, Harraway, Said, Chow, and Zizeck.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>I AM PROVIDENCE: THE WORDS AND WORLDS OF H.P. LOVECRAFT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>No writer is more closely associated with Providence than the sci-fi and "cosmic horror" genius Howard Phillips "H.P." Lovecraft. So, what better place to explore his work than a RISD classroom yards from where the author lived and worked? This course will provide students not just with a survey of Lovecraft's world-famous fiction, but an exploration of his nonfiction (letters, essays, etc.), his critical reception (from scholarly journals to the New Yorker and the New York Review of Books), his influences (Poe, Maupassant, and others), and his considerable imprint on contemporary culture (from comic books to films to video games to heavy metal lyrics). Writing assignments will range from analytical essays to creative experiments imitating the author's distinctive subjects and style. The class will have a strong multimedia component where students will examine films, plays, music, and visual art inspired by Lovecraft. We will also spend significant time outside the classroom, taking guided historical tours of Lovecraft's Providence and trips to his gravesite and beloved Ladd Observatory. Throughout the course, students will also take advantage of the Lovecraft Collection at Brown's John Hay Library - the world's preeminent Lovecraft archive.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AFRICAN AMERICAN REALISM: 1940-1960</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Richard Wright (an author whose influence loomed large throughout the Realist period) expressed his admiration for what he called "fighting with words: using words as weapons." Throughout this course we will examine the variety of ways in which writers of the Realist period used their writing as a "weapon" to protest against the racism they saw as endemic to white American society and as a means of linking the African-American struggle for equality with other forms of political struggle occurring worldwide. Marked by a focus on urban realism, the role of the environment in the shaping of the individual, and a close interrelation of literature and politics, the Realist novel revealed the ways in which African Americans were denied the "American Dream" and, in James Baldwin's words, provided a new language with which to express the African American experience. Authors include Richard Wright, James Baldwin, Anne Petry, Chester Himes, Ralph Ellison and Gwendolyn Brooks.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>POLITICS AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the intersection of the questions "What is the political?" and "What is the political film?" Filmmakers and scholars have asked these questions in a variety of ways:  Can film form be fascist?  Or left-leaning radical? Can the form be radical if the content is not? And, vice versa, can content be radical in a traditional form?  Is film political only in terms of social issues?  Or can film be political also in terms of filmmaking?  The arrival of film theory's idea of the political unconscious made it possible to ask these questions even of the slightest Hollywood entertainment.  In order to make sense of this discussion we will consider the political use of the apparatus, the narrative, the genre--documentary, Hollywood blockbuster, independent--and the reception as well as the history of the political film.  Throughout the course our speculation will be aimed at answering the practical question "How does one make a political film?"  Students will be required to write analytical papers throughout the semester.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221. Register into the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ROMANTIC TO EDWARDIAN BRITISH LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley (Transformation), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Conrad (Secret Sharer) and Lawrence. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In order to keep up with current work, the specific content of the course will change each year. We will study fiction and film in English and in translation (subtitled). In the past, the work of Salman Rushdie, Mario Vargas Llosa, Kamila Shamsie, Tash Aw, Shahrnush Parsipur, and Haruki Murakami has been included.  In addition to the assigned reading, we will screen and discuss an international film each week. By the end of the semester, thematic and stylistic links as well as the uniqueness of certain work, like Kore-eda Hirokazu's After Life, Oppenheimer's The Act of Killing, or Roy Andersson's You, the Living, will become apparent.

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We begin with a study of the bird painters, illustrators and photographers, most notably, of course, John James Audubon, and continue with the symbolic bird of poetry and literature, such as &lt;i&gt;Green Mansions &lt;/i&gt; by W.H. Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FICTION AND THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the 1990s Queer Theory emerged as a critique of the ways in which power institutionalizes and thereby legitimates certain forms of sexuality while marginalizing others.  Sue-Ellen Case, a performance theorist, claims that "queer theory works not at the site of gender, but at the site of ontology, to shift the ground of being itself. Queer revels constitute a kind of activism that attacks the dominate notion of the natural. The queer is the taboo-breaker, the monstrous, the uncanny" (quoted from Queer Theories). Through our readings of seminal queer theorists such Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gayle Rubin, we will explore important questions about the politics of queerness. Our investigation will focus on sexuality and gender, closeting, homophobia and drag, the aesthetics of queer literature, and the ways queer writers such as Leslie Feinberg, Kate Bornstein, and Randall Kenan interrogate and inscribe such subjects in their work.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

   <COURSETITLE>CANTERBURY TALES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>One night, late in the fourteenth century, in a tavern outside London, a quiet little fellow named Geoffrey, so the story goes, joined a lively crew about to ride sixty miles to Canterbury.  To entertain themselves on the way, they began a story-telling contest.  The premise is fiction; however, the resulting Canterbury Tales offers some of the most memorable poetic narratives ever written. Geoffrey Chaucer (1345-1400), called sometimes the "father" of English poetry, wrote tales of back-alley rendezvous, the lives of knights, saints, and independent women, the misadventures of talking chickens, and more than one scurrilous story about scheming students. Participants in the class will learn to read Middle English as we go (which is not as difficult as it might seem: think Shakespeare with funny spelling).  There will be regular quizzes, midterm and final exams, and a modestly researched critical paper.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter, and Melancholia illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of No Country for Old Men in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's Shalimar the Clown or Bahman Ghobadi's Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's The Submission, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior, Krakauer and Penn's Into the Wild, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary Gasland, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in Moonrise Kingdom, and imaginary places in films like After Life (Kore-eda Hirokazu), Micmacs (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and Marwencol (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Film has profoundly influenced and perpetuated the constructed images of African-descended peoples across the world. This course explores the cultural, economic, political, and ideological motivations behind the problematic representation of "blacks" in cinema and television in the USA and other areas of the world while examining film as a genre with a vocabulary and idiom of its own.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHINESE CINEMA: QUESTIONS OF NATIONALISM, REALISM, AND FILM STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore Chinese Cinema as a national cinema and as a transnational cinema in both its popular and classic forms; however, the term 'Chinese' has been and is still a debated term among the very populations that lay claim to it, i.e., mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chinese diaspora, the People's Republic. These debates make the study of Chinese film a study of how to categorize or know film itself. In other words, exploring Chinese film in a Western critical arena within the hegemony of Western film studies begs theoretical questions about the very dominant and commonplace terms and perspectives used to examine all film in the 21st century, i.e, What are these films showing us?  What are we looking for?  What do we see?  Investigating these theoretical quandaries will also be a part of this course.  We will survey representative films produced before 1949, during the shift from of the cultural capital from Yan'an to Shanghai 1950-1964, during the Cultural Revolution (1964-1986), and during its emergence as the premier transnational cinema (late-1980s to 2000s).  We will also consider the particular film genres and film schools of Chinese cinema. Students will be responsible for reading critical and theoretical essays, viewing all required films, writing analytical papers on assigned topics, and presenting one oral sequence analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE nTH RACE: INTRODUCTION TO TRANSRACIALITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Thanks to "advances" in medical and psychiatric technology, we are now able to view gender as a transformative aspect of life: we are not stuck in the sexed body with which we were born.  However, our racial identity is still something that seems biologically inescapable, in spite of the now very rich and convincing theoretical history of its constructed, non-essential nature.  While the history of transsexualism is marked by the potentially political affect of social transgression, the history of transraciality speaks to us from advertisements for skin-blanching creams, history-denying acts of racial passing, and community betrayal.  This is, however, contrary to the everyday experience which finds that individual and group racial identification is a process which is necessarily transracial: in declaring ourselves racially, we all cross boundaries set by societies contemporary and past.  In this course, we will attempt to reconfigure race through the discourse of transsexualism.  The "race" produced, thus like the "third" gender produced by transsexuality, will lead to a complication of existent preconceptions about racial stereotypes and formation.  We will use Deirdre N. McCloskey's &lt;i&gt;Crossing: a Memoir&lt;/i&gt; and the film &lt;i&gt;Paris is Burning&lt;/i&gt; to build a vocabulary of transsexualism from which we will read texts in which racial lines are crossed.  Among the required texts are: Frances Harper's &lt;i&gt;Iola Leroy&lt;/i&gt;, Andre Gide's &lt;i&gt;The Immoralist&lt;/i&gt;, Octavia Butler's &lt;i&gt;Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, and R.

   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEXUALITY &amp; SUBVERSION: FICTION &amp; FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Rope to Fried Green Tomatoes to Fight Club and beyond, 20th century mainstream American writers and filmmakers toyed with and hinted at-or even overtly confronted-the concept of homosexuality, often with mixed results. Critics, reviewers, and even scholars have generally labeled these popular texts "subversive," but were they? If so, to what extent and why? In order to explore these and other questions, we will initially investigate the term subversion (as opposed to transgression or "ludic play"), through theoretical texts and class discussions. We will then move on, to see how subversion might (or might not) work within and among the competing, complementary, and conflicting discourses in various texts. In addition to those listed above, the literary texts and films will likely include: Boys on the Side, The Women of Brewster Place, Single White Female, M. Butterfly, Truth or Dare, Madonna's Sex, The Object of My Affection, The Next Best Thing, and others.  At the semester's end, we will examine Brokeback Mountain as the 21st century's "answer" to the texts of the preceding century. Students will write several brief responses, give a class presentation, and take a midterm and final exam. In addition, students will need to acquire online or other access to the films.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The fictions we will examine in this course, however, may have few or none of those qualities:  they may be nonrealist, nonnarrative, postmodern, or fall somewhere between and among these categories, but they provide a counterpoint and challenge to preconceived notions of what a story ought to look like, how it should unfold, and even what relationship the readers should have to the text. We will begin the course with some more traditional stories and then move directly into examining alternative fictions. The readings will likely be selected from texts written by the following authors: Donald Barthelme, Kathy Acker, Italo Calvino, Ishmael Reed, Pamela Zoline, Angela Carter, Ursula LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Dixon, Michael Wilkerson, Karen Brennan, and others. In addition to the readings, students will be required to give a presentation (with at least one other member of the class), write several responses, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EKPHRASIS AND ITS REVERSE: WRITING FROM ART, ART FROM WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Here's Marcel Proust on his love of art: "Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves, to know what another person sees of a universe which is not the same as our own." Instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists. I want to do something similar in this course: to encourage students to see visual art in terms of writing and writing in terms of visual art, and thus to inspire them in their own studio practice and writing. Students will write creative texts related to their artistic interests or the work of the artists who inspire them and will create art in response to literary texts. We will read various writers (Rilke, Proust, WH Auden, Frank O'Hara - many others) who have been influenced by visual artists, and vice-versa. We will explore questions of narrative, framing, place, autobiography, appropriation, metaphor and symbol, truth and realism, irony, and so on. How can a poem or piece of fiction 'tell the story' of a sculpture or painting? How can a painting 'translate' a passage from Proust, a short story by Kafka or a poem by Elizabeth Bishop? How can it fail, and how are these failures interesting? What is lost in translation between art and literature, and what does this say about the singularity of each medium?  Our overarching aim will be to inspire students through a series of juxtapositions (looking at the similarities between negative space in painting and 'silences' in literature, for example), and to encourage them to engage with and find inspiration in ideas and methods from fields beyond their major.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The advanced workshop assumes that students have some experience with writing fiction and are ready for an environment that will challenge them to hone, revise, and distill their craft. A writer begins inspired by dreams, language, a face in a crowd. But inspiration is only the beginning of a writer's work. In this course we'll study form, theme, voice, language, character, and plot. We'll also read and talk about stories by masters of the craft. The aim of the workshop is to help you discover what your stories want to be and fulfill the promise of your original vision.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Prerequisite: ENGL E412 Beginning Fiction Writing Workshop or equivalent experience.&lt;BR&gt; Prerequisite or class level does not apply when course is offered during wintersession.&lt;BR&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, we will be looking at various displays of the human body, focusing on four main arenas: the freak show, the minstrel show, the drag show, and the human zoo. We will focus extensively on the 19th and early 20th centuries, the heyday of human exhibitions, and move forward to current modes of display, which both contest and refigure earlier spectacles. Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Professional actor/director Fred Sullivan (Trinity Repertory Company resident artist and RISD Acting Workshop instructor)  will guide a company of student actors, designers, stage managers, and construction crew through a workshop process of producing a live play for the stage, culminating in a weekend of public performances of the production. Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We explore both narrative and nonfiction films and videotapes.  We write essays to establish critical standards.  We produce personal film essays by raiding the family album of photos and movies. The course thus aims to combine the humanist perspective with a recognition of actual production.  We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ITALY AND THE AMERICAN LITERARY IMAGINATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course centers on three interrelated American fiction writers--- Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry James, and Edith Wharton---who imaginatively use settings in Italy to develop complex characters and plots. Reading Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, Henry James' Daisy Miller, The Portrait of a Lady and/or The Wings of the Dove, and Edith Wharton's short stories such as The Eyes and Roman Fever, we will explore the rich aesthetic and psychological components of fiction dealing with Americans encountering Italian culture.  Since the visual arts---painting, sculpture, and architecture-play a significant role in each of the texts we read, they will be a part of our focus.  Students will keep journals, write three analytical papers, and take a final exam.  Students may choose to construct a final project (including a strong written dimension) that will substitute for the final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ECOPOEMS/ECOPOETICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At the beginning of an interview with poets Robert Hass, Brenda Hillman, Evelyn Reilly, and Jonathan Skinner, Angela Hulme writes that, although nature and environment have long been inspirational for poets, "today, amidst mounting scientific evidence of ecological disturbance-with key indicators now signaling a changing climate, a global water crisis, and the decline or disappearance of numerous wildlife species-many poets are engaging with their environments and with the question of human environmental impact in increasingly critical ways."  In this course we will examine a range of texts and practices in order to survey the state of contemporary North American ecopoetry/ecopoetics.  Course activities will include reading, analyzing, and discussing ecopoems and critical essays on ecopoems and ecopoetics; regular writing assignments; and the development of a personal ecopoetics practice.  Although the ecopoems and ecopoetics texts we will study in class all use writing as their medium, we will also consider what it might look like to migrate an ecopoetics practice into visual realms.  Students need not have previous training in creative writing to participate in this course.  &lt;BR&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How do directors transform fiction into film?  In this course we'll see several films and read the novels on which they're based. We'll talk about the ways in which their makers use two very different art forms to render the same (or is it?) material.  Taped interviews with contemporary directors, actors, cinematographers and writers will let us hear from the artists themselves. Coursework includes readings, video screenings, discussions, exercises, and a final project. Warning: The course involves a good deal of writing, and the films are sexually explicit.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUNK CINEMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the punk-new wave musical revolution was brewing in the mid 1970s, underground filmmakers were also embracing the punk spirit of experimentation, a do-it-yourself ethos, and an uneasy, often defiant relationship with all things authoritative or mainstream. This course will trace and map the contours of punk cinema, from its roots in neorealism and the French New Wave, to its branches in the No Wave and Cinema of Transgression movements of the early 1980s. Time permitting, we?ll look forward to the post-punk era to consider how the legacy of punk informs later film movements such as Dogme 95.  Directors we?ll encounter may include: Amos Poe, Alex Cox, Derek Jarman, Slava Tsukerman, Lars von Trier, and Penelope Spheeris. While not a prerequisite, some background in critical film theory will be beneficial in this course, as will a commitment to academic reading, writing, and lively discussion.</COURSEDESC>

Is there progressive potential in the trend toward computerization? Or contrarily, in what ways might technophilia and technocracy obstruct collective betterment? We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Requirements for the course include regular short writing assignments, a modest research paper, a final examination, and attendance at a local theatrical production.  &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This survey course focuses on the history of landscapes in the pre-industrialized world. Landscapes will be considered as an evolving condition, even when their defining characteristics were conceived and built at a specific point in time.  Critical to this course will be the establishment of frameworks for historical inquiry, the refinement of research methodologies, in the development of multiple perspectives through which to question and understand the design environment.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Art History credit for Landscape Architecture majors required; Liberal Arts elective credit for non-majors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Landscape is a term that can refer to a specific locale, design, or a collection of ideas. The term usually implies a system of interrelated cultural and natural forces operating within a context of a defined scale or disciplinary boundaries.  In this course we examine and discuss the foundational definitions of the term landscape and the theoretical stances that are active in the creation of contemporary landscape architecture, land art and other creative disciplines. Writing assignments will be based upon fundamental texts, direct experience, and contemporary projects. Weekly readings will be discussed and diagrammed in class for content and structure. Students will produce a series of  five short (2 to 3 page) analytical essays and case studies. There will be weekly discussion sections with course TAs to review readings, two field assignments, and one field trip to the Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum in Boston. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to qualified undergraduates and non-majors by instructor permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops the different levels of dexterity and control in the construction of architectural drawing. The pedagogy allows for students to build a basic understanding of orthographic drawing typologies and traditional drawing methods while preparing them for more complex hybridized drawing methods. A parallel segment of the course addresses freehand representation, developing observation and translation tools necessary to design. Through these multiple approaches, drawing is developed as a tool to transform conceptual ideas into tangible form. The class will be taught as a series of lectures that discuss both why and how we draw accompanied by skill building workshops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The Hybrid Drawing course develops an understanding of digital modeling and rendering in the first six weeks of the semester and then merges those digital techniques with manual tools of drawing.  The digital skills developed through Autodesk 3ds Max Design program will include basic digital modeling concepts, transformation of objects, spline-based modeling, the development of compound objects, and rendering with textures to develop an understanding of light in space. Students will be encouraged to explore innovative new uses for the software and explore combinatory workflows with manual representation methods, enhancing their technical skills while developing creative methodology.&lt;BR&gt;  Through exploratory exercises, students will be given a more advanced and robust understanding of the possibilities of digital representation, building upon the foundations of Representation I and II. The purpose of this seminar is to impart the familiarity with the various media that will allow students to comfortably engage digital modeling in an integral drawing process which integrates manual and digital techniques in design.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00  &lt;i&gt;Elective; LDAR majors only, Open to ARCH + INTAR by permission of instructor&lt;BR&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux.

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since it's creation over 100 years ago, landscape architecture has expanded beyond horticultural preoccupations to a discipline that engages natural, political and cultural systems to build ecological and social resilience.  This professional practice seminar explores contemporary practices of landscape architecture through the exploration of six current trends in practice: &lt;b&gt; operating, researching, engaging, constructing, programming,&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;b&gt;sustaining&lt;b&gt;.  These topics are explored and discussed through student research initiatives, in-class lectures, readings, case study presentations from a wide range of practitioners, office visits, and site visits.  The goal of the course is to expose students to the variety of ways to practice landscape architecture today.  Students are encouraged to ask questions, bring their own experiences to class, and be open to new ideas and perspectives.  &lt;br&gt; Please see 2014 class blog for student content and writing samples: http://principlesofpractice2014.tumblr.com&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TOPICS IN REPRESENTATION II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing.&lt;BR&gt; An essential ingredient in the course involves the Medium. While we will discuss "medium" as it relates to the "message" (MacLuhan), we will also medium within themes of workflow production and the experimentation process, and the conveyance of the artists' intent. Another essential ingredient is Process, (or evidence of a process). This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. Lastly, Corroboration as a separate theme will highlight the expected mutual reinforcement that takes place between visceral representation and quantitative infographic overlays.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Major Elective;Open to ARCH and LDAR majors; Open to others by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*SRI LANKA: NORTHERN VISIONS SRI LANKA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This travel course will explore the rich architectural, landscape and artisan traditions of the island nation of Sri Lanka. Located just 22 miles across the Palk Strait from the southeastern coast of India, the island has a long and rich history of settlement dating back to at least the 6th C BCE. People from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Portugal, the Netherlands and England have arrived, conquered and stayed, leaving an elaborate tapestry of artistic traditions, religions and customs.&lt;BR&gt;  We will visit the Buddhist stupas and lakes of Anuradhapura, ancient capital of the Kingdom of Sri Lanka, dating to the late 4th C BCE, and the Buddhist temples of Kandy, last capital of independent Sri Lanka founded in the 14th C and nestled in the central highlands. There we will explore the 19th-early 20th C hillside homes and verdant tea plantations of the British colonizers and the ancient stone rainwater harvesting tanks and cascading irrigation systems. We will visit the Portuguese Fort and Dutch city of Galle on the southern coast and study works of the great Sri Lankan modern architect Geoffrey Bawa and his disciples in the capital Colombo and across the southern parts of the island. En route we will visit village textile cooperatives and artisan cottage industries to see how these traditions are being kept alive and how they are part of larger strategies aimed at social and economic empowerment.&lt;BR&gt;  The goal of the course is to create an annotated visual documentation of ancient through contemporary architectural, landscape and artisan practices in Sri Lanka. These will include siting strategies, material and structural studies, climate control and resource management systems, spatial layouts and use patterns, and artisan processes. The entire Wintersession period will be spent in Sri Lanka with regular work sessions for compilation of data and observations built into the trip. &lt;BR&gt;  Note: This course is part of a multi-year RISD involvement with Sri Lanka through DESINE-Lab@RISD. The larger effort focuses on the northern region of the island and the reconstruction and refugee resettlement process following the country's three-decade civil war. While the material produced in the course is a critical component of the larger effort and there will be DESINE-Lab members running workshops in conflict-impacted areas in the weeks prior to Wintersession, this travel course will NOT be going to the north of the country.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to Sophomores and Above. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $571.00; Airfare not included&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar introduces a spectrum of research methodologies meaningful to design disciplines focusing on the intersection of the human, built and natural worlds - approaches stemming for the social sciences, environmental sciences, and design practice.  Students will work through a variety of written and visual means to explore differences between, and uses of, quantitative and qualitative data collection, analysis, interpretation, and application.  Methods to be explored include Grounded Theory, Phenomenological Inquiry, Participatory approaches, Ethnography, Comparative approaches, Case Study, Postmodern Critical Theory, Systems Theory, survey, narrative, typologies, experimentation, modeling, matrices, mapping, design as research, and social and environmental impact assessment and evaluation.  Special attention will be paid to issues of causality, generalization, values and ethics.  &lt;BR&gt;  The class will be organized around a set of related issues water, ground and poverty, with a focus on the city of Providence.  There will be two phases of research with the class participants determining the over-riding research question. Each phase will involve teamwork where teams will utilize different research methodologies to examine the same basic question, and will include written and visual documentation, analysis and interpretation.  At the end of each phase, students will explore the differences between the various methodologies and their outcomes and discuss when and how certain approaches and their combination may be more or less effective as part of the practice, critique and scholarship of design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This graduate seminar meets two days a week, three hours each.  It is required for all first-year students in Landscape Architecture. &lt;BR&gt; Open to Graduate Level only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Senior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR HONORS INTERDISCIPLINARY CRITIQUE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course in which first-semester seniors who have already demonstrated unusual commitment, ambition and initiative within their majors will pursue and discuss independent work in a setting that reflects, as closely as possible, the interdisciplinary conversation that actually takes place around advanced art practice today. The course is intended to allow those working within medium-specific vocabularies to test how their work will make meaning in an art world in which a variety of disciplinary histories and conventions coexist, clash, and inform one another, as well as to provide an opportunity for students whose work bridges two or more disciplines (or involves performance/new genres/post-studio approaches) to learn from one another and from faculty capable of addressing all of these sorts of practices. This is a demanding critique course with additional seminar components (readings, screenings, discussions, slide presentations, etc.), and as such students can expect a workload equivalent to a core studio requirement within their major.&lt;br&gt;  Acceptance into the course will be based on a GPA of 3.25 or greater as well as the recommendation of faculty and department heads from the student's major and on review of previous work. Candidates will be identified in discussions between the instructor and department heads during the preceding spring semester. Successful completion of ARTH-H490/PAINT-4507 (Contemporary Art &amp; its Discourses) or equivalent coursework is a prerequisite, ensuring students have a shared understanding of the art historical context for interdisciplinary. The maximum enrollment is limited to seminar-size (c. 15 students) in order to provide sufficient attention to each student's work in group and individual critiques while still allowing for seminar-style discussions.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THREE CRITICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Three Critics" will offer graduate students the opportunity to get inside the art critic's head and learn how writers think about the visual. Students will be exposed to a wide range of viewpoints and discourse on contemporary art issues as defined by the interests of three different, practicing critics. Each critic will become part of the RISD community for approximately one month, conducting 3 sessions on campus and one in New York or Boston. On-campus meetings will consist of lectures, reading and writing assignments, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits. Off-campus trips will include visits to museums, galleries and artist studios. Small groups of students will be expected to lead several classes. Outside coursework and full participation in class discussion required for successful completion.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Painting department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Requirement for second-year graduate Painting graduate students. Five additional seats available for Fine Arts graduate students. For admission, students submit a one-page writing sample to the Graduate Painting Coordinator.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at two phenomena, the academy and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices from the 1990s to the present.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide array of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting -- but not its most traditional conventions.  With a deep engagement in process and informed by readings and targeted artists and art historical movements, students will explore materiality and visual culture. Shopping for "art supplies" will take place as much at Home Depot as at Utrecht. Employing the recycled and trash, the found and gathered, and the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning.  From duct tape to cotton balls soaked in acrylic paint -- one finds context, from varying thicknesses of rope dipped in polymer mediums to woven plastic shopping bags -- one finds structure, and from paint squirted from plastic ketchup bottles to fake fur -- one finds attitude.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course open to all majors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLOR STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio-based course will provide the foundation necessary to understand basic color theory and practice in painting, art, and design. An historical and cultural perspective will be introduced to inform ongoing color studies executed in the studio. Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Open to all majors&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will examine a series of canonical readings of contemporary art, focusing primarily on key writings published in the journal October and the magazine Artforum since 1975. We will engage in detail with such overarching critical concepts as postmodernism, neo-avant-garde, site-specificity, and relational aesthetics. We will also examine readings that draw on concepts such as the fetish, the abject, the informe, the gaze, primitivism, and postcolonialism. Finally, we will attend to issues of writerly style and method, seeking to understand the wide variety of tools that critics and art historians employ to understand, historicize, and enrich our understanding of works of contemporary art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Painting majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by Painting department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Also offered as HAVC-H490 for non-painting majors &lt;/i&gt;    Requirement for Junior Painting Majors Also offered as HAVC-H490 for non-painting majors</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING IN 3-D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a laboratory sited at the crossroads where drawing and the physical world overlap, perform, and deploy one another. Logistically speaking, assignments will address the challenges implicit in making work beyond the rectangle of the page. We will engage this subject through a combination of studio-based assignments, readings, and in-class discussions and critiques. In specific terms, we will be working through a series of studio-based assignments that will aid us in our interrogation and engagement of the mimetic, sublime, and theatrical notions of space. Together we will arrive at an understanding of these terms by using Miwon Kwon's text "Promiscuity of Space: Some Thoughts on Jessica Stockholder's Scenographic Compositions" as a roadmap for our inquiries. Kwon's essay presents an alternative narrative to the claims made by Rosalind Krauss in her influential text Sculpture in the Expanded Field. In Kwon's essay there is a prompt to investigate connections between Krauss' "Expanded Field of Sculpture" and the 'field' of Color Field paintings. This course takes the possibility of a connection between these spatial locations to its logical conclusion via the medium and activity of drawing in 3-D space. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FOCUS:GO FIGURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will investigate various approaches to representing the figure in contemporary art. Such things as the historical, psychological and narrative implications of using a human form in a work of art will be emphasized. There will be an exploration of studio-based strategies that will include working from observation and using mediated imagery such as film stills and photography.  Students will start with in-class assignments working from a model in an interior that will culminate in a large-scale project that investigates the broader interpretation of figuration. Students will be challenged in technical, formal and conceptual approaches to creating a figurative work of art. While technical instruction will be focused primarily on painting, drawings and collage, students will be encouraged to also work in the media of their choice. In-class assignments will be supplemented with PowerPoint presentations as well as film and video screenings, reading materials, and critiques.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FROM OBSERVATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be a marathon of daily painting assignments designed to develop confidence and experience with representational painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language in critiques. No prior painting experience is required and Foundation students considering painting as their major are encouraged to enroll, as well as majors from other departments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students are advised not to take a second Wintersession course because of the commitment of time this course will require.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MONSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate cultural traditions of the "monster", broadly defined as an entity of horrific other-ness. Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRIMARY SOURCES ILLUMINATING THE OCEAN DEEP AT THE NEW BEDFORD WHALING MUSEUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOBOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is not far fetched to think of our times as the Golden Age of the photobook. Never before have there been that many makers of photobooks, ranging from major publishers to individual artists producing their own photobooks "on demand." This development is both a reaction to and a consequence of new - digital - technologies, which have vastly lowered the barrier that stands between a photographer and her/his own photobook. As a consequence, there now is a small industry dedicated solely to photobooks, a development jump-started by the success of Martin Parr and Gerry Badger's two-volume The Photobook: A History. &lt;BR&gt; The purpose of this course is twofold. First, it introduce students to the photobook, its role and purpose, and its history. Part of the historical survey will be to study well-known or important photobooks to see how they operate. Readings will be given to explore, text, sequencing and concept. Students will use their on going studio work to complete assignments to establish photo book design and sequencing skills. Each student will complete a photobook for the class final project. There will be an assignment designed to help produce a digital proof but the final book will be hand printed and bound at a custom binder. Distribution of the photobook and self-publishing will be explored in depth.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;This is a laptop based class.  Laptop required&lt;br&gt; Elective, Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; Fee for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The lines between still and time-based media are blurring in the digital era. New cameras offer both modes of image capture and image files are infinitely malleable. This course follows Issues &amp; Image I and introduces students to a wide range of critical issues and expressive approaches in time-based (lens-based) work, concentrating on work of the past two decades. Course time will be divided among multimedia lectures, group discussions, visiting artists/curators, in-class projects, and student presentations. Reading and writing assignments will introduce students to the concepts and language of time-based work. Class lectures will expose them to a large range of styles, methods, genres and content concerns. Practical assignments (including a collaboratively-produced videotape, individually edited and presented to the class) will allow students to put theory into practice and understand in a low-tech, hands-on way the expressive possibilities of time-based work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; Registration by Photography department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making.  We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)  Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOBOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is not far fetched to think of our times as the Golden Age of the photobook. Never before have there been that many makers of photobooks, ranging from major publishers to individual artists producing their own photobooks "on demand." This development is both a reaction to and a consequence of new - digital - technologies, which have vastly lowered the barrier that stands between a photographer and her/his own photobook. As a consequence, there now is a small industry dedicated solely to photobooks, a development jump-started by the success of Martin Parr and Gerry Badger's two-volume The Photobook: A History. &lt;BR&gt; The purpose of this course is twofold. First, it introduce students to the photobook, its role and purpose, and its history. Part of the historical survey will be to study well-known or important photobooks to see how they operate. Readings will be given to explore, text, sequencing and concept. Students will use their on going studio work to complete assignments to establish photo book design and sequencing skills. Each student will complete a photobook for the class final project. There will be an assignment designed to help produce a digital proof but the final book will be hand printed and bound at a custom binder. Distribution of the photobook and self-publishing will be explored in depth.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;This is a laptop based class.  Laptop required&lt;br&gt; Elective, Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; Fee for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The web has assimilated into our physical world and the active attempt of merging the two continues by individuals, communities, corporations, and algorithms. From Web sites to websites, to apps, a powerful system, encompassing both social and consumerist networks now pervades our everyday lives. Where do artists stand in the simultaneous democratization and centralization of data and information technologies? What "other" can the web be?  &lt;br&gt; This course explores the theoretical and practical framework of the web. The building blocks of the modern web will be covered, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students will initiate, prototype and iterate web-based projects of their choosing. Students are encouraged to interpreted the web as an experimental, conceptual platform, a space for outreach and community building and a place for organizing and exhibiting one's professional work in any medium. Surveys and discussions will be conducted on current artists using the web as a space for creative expression.  &lt;br&gt; Note: This is a laptop-based course. &lt;i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Elective; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an introduction to photographic methods and ideas. Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Deposit:$100&lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course fee and department receiving fee:$100.00 &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGE BANK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Image Bank is an interdisciplinary course investigating how new personal, social and political meanings can be generated from disparate visual sources. Sifting through the sedimentary layers of our experience of visual images (from high to mundane), each student will create a personalized image bank of at least 250 examples, including snapshots, postcards, newspaper and magazine clippings, internet images and their own photographs. What once seemed series of casually accumulated images becomes something concrete and intentional. Students will each create personal "rules" for  their collecting, yet be challenged to explore how meanings change as they follow or bend those rules. Through collecting, indexing, and juxtaposing images, students will hone their skills as image interpreters and create new personal visual languages for themselves. In the end, each student will have a physical or digitized image bank to be used as source material for future projects. Throughout the course, we will explore artists whose work has focused on image collecting, including Gerhard Richter, Douglas Blau, Buzz Spector, John Cage, Martha Rossler, August Sander, Nina Katchadourian, John Baldessari, Hanne Darboven and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fee for non-majors: $100.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)  Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"The practice of taking pictures with a camera phone is so much more widespread than any other form of image-making in the history of humankind." - Mia Fineman, Associate Photography Curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY.&lt;BR&gt; Who is a photographer and who is the audience for photographic images today? How has the Internet changed conditions for taking, viewing, and sharing images? Increasingly, photographic images inhabit a virtual slipstream that dislodges pictures from both their object status and original author and context. The internet shifts, blurs, and multiplies the relationships between images.&lt;BR&gt; How are artists responding? In this class, you will engage in critical analysis of contemporary photographic practices in a networked age, and also define your own practice of collecting and organizing the images you upload to (or take from) the web.&lt;BR&gt; You will be developing different methodologies for presenting your "curated" collections including (but not limited to), book, tumblr, installation, YouTube, or blog formats. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORKSHOP: LIGHT TO INK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Contemporary Printmaking's use of photo print processes is ubiquitous. This class is about laying a foundation in making prints using those processes.  The class is designed to introduce students to the basics of Printmaking using either hand made, digital or photo-made matrixes. The class will learn to make prints using the traditional print methods of intaglio, lithography and screenprint and build a base of information about the production of the film transparencies from which the matrix is made. Students will be taught the skills necessary to take the photo, computer, or handmade image from a one or a series of positive transparencies to a finished print. "From Light to Ink" is a starting point for growth and exploration in photo printmaking and an introduction to printing in intaglio, lithography and screenprint. No prior knowledge of printmaking is required. This class is most appropriate for Sophomores, Juniors and 1st semester Seniors.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Non-Majors by Permission of Instructor&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by Printmaking department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

While intertwining this with content is part of it, it is 80% form and construction. Ultimately, we will work together to gain a solid foundation in this media that can transfer into and augment the individual's own departmental work.&lt;BR&gt; Decision and problem solving en route to a final piece is key in making books. The class will discuss the positives and negatives of choosing materials and the structural layout of a book, The importance of becoming familiar with adhesives, tools and potential problems in the process will be stressed.&lt;BR&gt; Aspects of adhesive and non adhesive bindings as well as traditional and non traditional books will be covered in ways to enable each student to determine where their strengths and desires lay. It also will create work that will convey the contents narrative into a complete idea. This should not only leave each person with an enthusiasm for the book form as art, but the ability and confidence to produce books on their own.  Assignments will be given each week with the objective of manifesting that week's demonstration and objectives into a realized binding. Each student will be required to produce a minimum of ten books. As weeks pass, we will slowly turn from teacher required bindings into student conceived bindings, ultimately culminating in a unique, wholly individual expression. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $175.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Elective; Elective for Non-Majors by Permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BOOKBINDING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class is primarily about learning the function of producing of artist books. It's objective is to acquaint students with the tools and materials as well as proper construction and execution so as to facilitate their ability to use the techniques as they wish. While intertwining this with content is part of it, it is 80% form and construction. Ultimately, we will work together to gain a solid foundation in this media that can transfer into and augment the individual's own departmental work.&lt;BR&gt; Decision and problem solving en route to a final piece is key in making books. The class will discuss the positives and negatives of choosing materials and the structural layout of a book, The importance of becoming familiar with adhesives, tools and potential problems in the process will be stressed.&lt;BR&gt; Aspects of adhesive and non adhesive bindings as well as traditional and non traditional books will be covered in ways to enable each student to determine where their strengths and desires lay. It also will create work that will convey the contents narrative into a complete idea. This should not only leave each person with an enthusiasm for the book form as art, but the ability and confidence to produce books on their own.  Assignments will be given each week with the objective of manifesting that week's demonstration and objectives into a realized binding. Each student will be required to produce a minimum of ten books. As weeks pass, we will slowly turn from teacher required bindings into student conceived bindings, ultimately culminating in a unique, wholly individual expression. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $175.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Elective; Elective for Non-Majors by Permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Presenting visual ideas clearly in any medium requires sensitive interaction with materials and an understanding of their possibilities. Intaglio processes encourage the generation of a rich variety of marks and surfaces. Proofing allows for analysis and insight into the way you construct an image, and is an ideal arena for color experimentation. Students are encouraged to master and adapt intaglio techniques in relation to their own imagery, and in the process gain proficiency in multiple-plate, color intaglio image-making, processing and printing. Group and individual critiques will allow for feedback and exchange of ideas. Emphasis is on imagery as much as technical competence, and students work towards a final project involving a series of related prints.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Printmaking majors only&lt;br&gt;Elective for nonmajors by permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: PAPERMAKING, TEMPLES, &amp; PRINTS: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTS OF JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material and its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Students who register for this class will also be registerd later by the Registrar for HAVC-H525 &lt;br&gt;Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED CRITICAL ISSUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is the meaning of the contemporary? Is it a specific temporal constellation, the fall-out from modernism, a condition of the present or rather the artist's role? And if we look into the darkness of the present-what might we see and what stories would we tell? We have entered yet another crisis of representation, one with its own distinct historical stakes. What pressures does this place on us as makers of objects, writing, encounters? How does our work orient itself to these questions? Grad Critical Issues takes up these questions through multiple logics -of the object, of the aesthetic, of the speculative, of the phenomenological, of the psychoanalytic, of the ecological and economic-to consider how trajectories of form and narrative intersect in contemporary sculpture.  &lt;br&gt; Through readings, lectures, and class discussions, we will examine discursive approaches to making, writing and thinking about sculptural practice, specifically attending to its historic, aesthetic, ethical, and curatorial contexts. Opening with Rosalind Krauss's seminal text "Sculpture in the Expanded Field," we trace the force of her thinking through Walter Benjamin, Marcel Duchamp, Minimalism, Land Art; consider the genealogies of Harold Szeemann's exhibition When Attitudes Become Form in light of Massimiliano Gioni's Unmonumental or Helen Molesworth's Part Objects/Part Sculpture, as examples. Additional readings include: Theodor Adorno, Giorgio Agamben, Sara Ahmed, Hal Foster, Sigmund Freud, Karl Marx, Rebecca Solnit, among others. Student generated research drawn from studio practice will also inform the dialogue.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Sculpture majors only&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONDITIONAL DYNAMICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We will create a unique learning environment where a classroom space is dedicated solely to the making and the display of the course work for the duration of the semester. This approach will encourage the participants to generate work that cannot be "carted in and carted out for a critique". The opportunity creates a unique format for interacting and making work within RISD's academic and facility structure. The explorations in this course are based on the fact that absolutely everything is a material and that everything can be manipulated using conditional approaches, responses and skills.&lt;BR&gt;  We will start with fundamental skills that use; contextual influences, site specific analysis and behavioral observations. The emphasis will always be on making. You must be willing to adapt the way you work and collaborate with one another during the development and fabrication of every exploration. There will be occasions when you are used as material to be worked with. &lt;BR&gt; After a series of investigations and assignments, studio participants will generate work that is connected to their own interests. Together we will also create an environment within the room that supports the optimum display for all of the individual works. Everyone will be required to document their individual process and contribute to a final class compilation. This course supports the exploration and engagement of interdisciplinary and experiential learning.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major Elective, Junior and Above&lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of department&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to build upon the fundamental principles of mold making and casting while exploring more complex concepts,  materials, and techniques. The transformative process of casting can embody the signs of growth or decay, of evolution and metamorphosis.  From cellular multiplicity to large scale sculptures, casting skills enable the artist to control the sensation of the finished work through a spectrum of materials and processes. &lt;BR&gt; Through demonstrations then hands-on exploration, students will pursue individual projects that reflect upon themes in sculpture that utilize casting for its unique versatility. Students will have extensive exposure to a variety of traditional and nontraditional materials. Processes will include multi-part shell molds, gypsum and composite materials for shell construction, urethane and silicone rubber, castable plastics, cold cast metals, and material specific release agents. We will review the possible health hazards associated with casting, and learn safe working methods, as well as have in-class discussions about concept and craft, various fabrication and finishing methods, and uses for molds in the making sculpture. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor. Elective; Sculpture majors must choose this class or SCULP 4691 during junior year.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class is a hands-on studio elective that explores the potential of fabric as a sculpture material.  We will spend the semester looking at useful examples of how fabrics have been utilized in a broad range of engineered solutions. Fabrics can be flexible, transparent, impermeable, delicate, rigid, lightweight, and stronger than steel. How has fabric been used to represent other materials in art? We will explore how fabric is being used in architecture, advertising, fashion, and design. We will consider the diverse functionality of all kinds of fabric and plastic materials and explore how these materials are engineered for specific purposes. We will study inflatable fabric structures as they have been engineered for art, architecture, advertising and functional objects. Students will build their own projects after learning the basics of patternmaking, assembly, and surface manipulation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Class will be held at a Brown University location, John Street Studios, per special arrangement.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED CRITICAL ISSUES SEMINAR II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Critical Issues Seminar 2 introduces a rigorous theoretical framework for thinking and writing about contemporary sculpture practice. Each seminar develops from a specific theme drawing on research from Grad Critical Issues 1, current debates in the field and contemporary events. Past seminars include: Artificial Natures, Precarious Relations, Frankenstein and Crime, Vanishing Points, as examples. Trespassing across sculpture, performance, cinema, fiction, feminist, queer, race and political theory and back again, we will address writings by Walter Benjamin, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Maggie Nelson, Claudia Rankine, Jacques Rancire (as examples) in conversation with contemporary artists writings and projects to cultivate a conceptual grammar to extend to our studio practice. Approaching issues in contemporary sculpture through these discursive perspectives generates new strategies simultaneously material, conceptual, and critical.  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Sculpture majors only&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most people accept and believe in many things  that exhibit this phenomena because, there are many daily experiences we have with our lives that does not include our physical presence. We often respond and remember these uninhabitable experiences as though we had physically been there. Some existing formats include television programs,  theater performances, movies, the internet, historic recreations, store windows, miniaturization, dioramas, postcards, fantasy, cartoons etc.&lt;BR&gt; Artists and designers have benefitted from actively participating and manipulating where to locate the viewer as a part of the work they are making, keeping them at bay...from architects to cake bakers. (and it works) What happens when you address these issues directly and create works that are based on our acceptance of a physically limited engagement as being reality? Class participants will be encouraged to exploit this phenomena through class assignments, and their own interests and visual pursuits.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will discuss, experiment and challenge the notion of metal as traditional industrial workhorse, or as coveted art object and embrace or reject these ideas as we create with this medium. Students will be encouraged to pursue other nontraditional uses of metal, through scavenging, collecting, transforming metal from various states into new surfaces and forms. With safety and ingenuity we will put into practice work of the hand and machine, use computer driven techniques in tandem with the deliberate and accidental to experiment with pattern, surface, line, form and color. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor. &lt;br&gt;Elective, Sculpture majors must choose this class or SCULP 4692 during junior year.&lt;br&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Iron, as a material for sculpture, has a unique visual quality and history separate from Bronze and other traditional art metals. As one of the oldest and most common elements in the universe, it makes up the core of our planet and it runs through our veins. Artists respond to the transformation of Iron from elemental Earth to a liquid state fueled by fire; emerging as a new solid form, with an organic life that changes over time as it begins the slow return to its origin. We embrace the mechanical and architectural heritage of this material and its role in the Industrial Revolution; we marvel at its structure and strength, or its crystalline surface and depth, while adopting its history or reinventing its meaning within our own work.&lt;BR&gt;  In this course we will explore form, material and process as we use cast Iron as a material for sculpture. We will delve into the physics of the furnace, and the technical aspects of casting Iron using RISD's first homemade blast furnace. Students will receive hands on experience in this vigorous and physical process of preparing and running an Iron Cupola, reclaiming and smashing up radiators and bathtubs to give them new life as sculpture. The course will culminate in an Iron Pour of work created in class, then return to the studio to complete the projects.&lt;BR&gt;  This course requires prior experience with casting and will also involve hands on physical activity in the preparation for the pour.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SPATIAL VIDEO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our eyes are nearly always drawn towards something moving over something inert. What innovative strategies can be employed to incorporate video, sculpture, and physical space into a single work, without one medium dominating the other? How can an artist resolve the fundamental differences between two-dimensional moving images and three-dimensional objects or space? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of assimilating video, photography, sound, performance, objects, and space through studying and constructing multimedia sculpture and installations. Throughout the semester we will be presented with assignments that examine these different possibilities from multiple perspectives, including studio projects that deploy video in a sculptural context, and sculpture that is only activated through a video work. We will study the recent history of artists and designers who engage multimedia techniques and experiment with new formats and technologies. Students will learn the basics of DSLR camera technique, digital video editing, audio production, audio/video display technology, and installation techniques. Students in the course should have an understanding of sculptural materials and fabrication techniques, and should be ready to experiment with the fundamental structure of the presentation of media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRESPASS: SPRING SCULPTURE WRITES PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The content of this course will be influenced by the sculpture department's visiting lecture series and artists invited into the class for projects and performances. Therefore fall and spring courses will be based upon these variables. Students should also expect to encounter accompanying readings and seminar scale discussions native to these discrete experiences. &lt;BR&gt; TRESPASS: sculpture writes performance is a experimental laboratory for thinking and making across the disciplines of sculpture and performance that uses writing as a critical choreographic tool. We trespass from sculpture to science fiction, cinema to landscape, punk rock to theory, dance to poetics, sound to insomnia, history to holodeck. These encounters-conceptual and material-engage a constellation of ideas surrounding critical writing and art-making processes. &lt;BR&gt;  To think, to construct, to write within such a surround invites a precarious approach to process and to concept untethering syntax (materially, linguistically, theoretically) from its rational grounds. From here we consider questions of improvisation, correspondence, movement, gesture, repetition, timing, our relationships to history (personal and cultural), utopia and dream. &lt;BR&gt;  Structured as a series of workshops, the laboratory unfolds through individual and collaborative projects, critiques, readings and discussions of artists' writings and theoretical texts. Readings will include Walter Benjamin, Anne Carson, W.G. Sebald, Paul Virilio, Shelley Jackson, Mike Kelley, Jorge Luis Borges, Sigmund Freud, Samuel Delany, Kelly Nipper, Douglas Gordon, Giles Deleuze and Flix Guattari, Avital Ronell, Ralph Lemon, Michel Foucault, Stephen Parrino, Kim Gordon, among others. Each semester two Visiting Artists, working along the edges of sculpture/performance/writing, will present their own work and develop a collaborative practice with the group.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Junior and above&lt;br&gt; Elective; non-majors by department permission&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCREEN/WALL/CANVAS/FIELD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will investigate notions of surface as material ground for projected light/images, as visual, sensory and cognitive zones of expanded space, and as landscape for actual and psychogeographic exploration. &lt;br&gt; By exploring the sites of wall/canvas/screen/field as locations where materials, surfaces and contexts combine, we will see how architecture, film/video, digital media, textiles, painting, land art, sculpture and fashion, are mediated by surface relations. In our contemporary context, these relations often fuse together, pass through, or bounce off each other, and so accrue as layered complexities of space and materiality, which, in the words of Guiliana Bruno, operate as 1"mediated transfers of states of mid, feelings, and moods unfolding between persons across surface space." &lt;br&gt; These concepts will be introduced through readings, lectures and studio projects. Students will be encouraged to bring their own work into the conversation and re/consider it through class discussion around these topics, so as to develop and challenge their current practice. &lt;br&gt; This course is inspired by Guiliana Bruno 2014 book "Surface: Aesthetics, Materiality &amp; Media" which will be a core text. &lt;br&gt; We will consider works by the following (amongst others): Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Tacita Dean, Anthony McCall, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Luis Barragan, Isaac Julien, Wong Kar-wai, Sophie Tottie, Krzystof Wodiczko, Tara Donovan, Sarah Oppenheimer, Robert Wilson, The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI), Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Maya Lin, Brian Tolle, and Gordon Matta-Clark.  &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;  Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore digital design and fabrication within the context of contemporary art, design, and architecture. Through a series of technical demonstrations, students will make connections between CAD/CAM software, digital fabrication technologies and the physical world. Students will become familiar with digital fabrication as it relates to traditional sculptural processes such as mold making/casting, metalworking and woodworking. &lt;BR&gt;  Students will undertake a series of projects exploring 3D model creation using various CAD applications, 3D scanning technologies, and experimental approaches to digital model generation. Simultaneously, digital models will be made physical through additive and subtractive fabrication technologies including 3D printing, CNC milling, and laser cutting. &lt;BR&gt;  The course will culminate with an ambitious final project encouraging students to blend digital fabrication technologies with their existing studio practice and/or research interest. &lt;BR&gt; The class will use Rhino3d as the primary CAD tool and students will need their own laptop with Rhino installed. The Mac version of Rhino is currently a free download and the Windows version is available at student pricing through rhino3d.com. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; Elective, nonmajors by permission of instructor. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>KNITTED FABRICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course approaches the development of machine knit fabrics and forms as one process, where aspects of form are developed along-side fabric patterns and structures. Continuing from the introductory course, Knitting Machine Techniques, students learn advanced construction techniques and knit structure drafting and shaping, in order to further develop their design processes and ideas for knits. Emphasis is placed on experimentation, careful consideration of materials, and research, as ideas about color, pattern, texture, drape, and concept, and working large scale are explored. Fully-fashioned garments are the primary three-dimensional forms to which students apply their ideas, in the form of two major projects. Through the semester, students bring their experience of garment building and shaping, their range of knitting skills and techniques, and their ability to express ideas in knitting to a higher level of resolution. Hand knitting, embellishment, dyeing, printing, finishing, felting and other processes are encouraged and can be integrated into the fabric design and construction.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Textile majors only; Junior only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL EMBROIDERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  There will be a series of small assignments to build up a repertoire of techniques and then a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personal creative images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.&lt;Br&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;During Fall/Spring Terms:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; Major requirement; Textile majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by Textile department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

How can we learn to intuit in the realm of the virtual and what are the boundaries of this experience? This course will allow new ways of "seeing" and "feeling" and use a computational framework in the design process. Rather than take a conventional approach based on the technical aspects of a specific software program, students will be exposed to a rich diversity of potential work flows. The goal of this course is enhancing personal craft and technique through these digital tools while exploring new potential approaches to advanced technology. The explanation of textiles structures and the architecture of cloth will serve as a starting point for ideas.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: To be determined(based on Model Shop Fee Structure) &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as ARCH-4705.

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirement for MAT, MA; MAT &amp; MA only &lt;br&gt; Fall 2015, the course will meet in the Project Open Door's location at 355 South Water Street&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LAB SCHOOL: LEARNING THROUGH ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This field-based class provides graduate students with an opportunity to experience and examine the dynamics of teaching and learning within an elementary school setting - particularly, Providence's Highlander Charter School. The course is predominantly concerned with the development of teaching and learning strategies with which to incorporate art and design into general education while at the same time maintaining both disciplines' integrity. There is a special emphasis on utilizing art and design to support any school's literacy initiative. The course is constructed with two complementary elements - a participatory component in which pairs of graduate students work collaboratively with a non-art specialist or general classroom teacher. Graduate students have the opportunity to lead small groups of children in formal teaching and learning experiences and to use these opportunities to reflect on matters of content, student understanding, and the effectiveness of communication.  The second component of the course is a seminar that uses the graduate students' authentic classroom experiences as an opportunity to examine a broad range of educational issues that include: the impact of teaching and learning environments, the diversity of learners, arts integration, culturally responsive teaching, technology in the classroom, and classroom management.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirementfor MAT; MAT only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: A GUIDED DRAWING SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media yet drawing can be independent of all other media. Can we make our drawing ventures have resonance? The goal is to understand drawing in a multivalent way through paced experiences and investigations via short research projects, three generative series and development of a sited-drawing plan. Methods will include teamed technical presentations of expertise or interest as well as examples of ancient and historical means of silverpoint, transfer drawings, panoramas and dioramas. Drawing epochs represented in the RISD Museum of Art, collection will be examined (through works by artists such as Wilfredo Lam, Gego, or the Rimpa period Korin Gafu.)  Focused critiques, readings and guided and self-directed independent studio production are components.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;MA elective; Elective for all other graduate students &lt;br&gt; Also offered as GRAD 658G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THESIS RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Department of Teaching + Learning in Art + Design requires MA candidates submit a capstone thesis in partial fulfillment of degree requirements. Candidates are given a degree of flexibility in determining the format for this work, but typically it takes the form of either a thesis research paper or a thesis workbook. The thesis research paper provides candidates with the opportunity to focus on a deep investigation of a single subject framed within the context of learning and through art and design. An essential characteristic of this approach to the thesis is in how it provides evidence of the candidate's ability to move beyond description to analysis and how she/he is able to place the subject of investigation within the realm of scholarship. The thesis workbook provides a candidate with the opportunity to make sense of their journey through her/his program in a more autobiographical and documentary manner. The thesis workbook format affords candidates the opportunity to explore how form can be exploited to visualize research. Whether presented as a thesis research paper or thesis workbook, this capstone requirement provides MA candidates with a formal opportunity to make public her/his understanding about a specific aspect of the nature of arts learning gained through her/his coursework, excursions into the scholarly literature and fieldwork experiences. The purpose here, therefore, is to conceive of the thesis not merely as an academic exercise but also contributing to program development as well as providing a reservoir of understandings that will inform the candidate's future professional practice as an educator.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate requirement for MA; MA only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course provides students from any major with the opportunity to explore the field of teaching as a possible career option beyond graduation. The course involves completing an internship with an art teacher two days a week in either public or private schools. Students enrolled in this course will hopefully, be able to translate some of their excitement for art and design to the school setting, and in doing so, become a valuable resource to both the art teacher and his/her students.  Students taking this course are also required to attend and participate in a weekly seminar to discuss their experiences and to further explore a variety of issues related to teaching art and design at the K-12 level. Selected readings, a directed reflective journal, presentations, and a leave-behind contribution to the assigned school are among the assignments for this course.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Undergraduates only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN EDUCATION STUDIO WORKSHOP: PLACE BASED LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The urban landscape is comprised of designed elements at multiple scales, ranging from a city's infrastructure to the architectural details of street furniture and building fagades. Although people are more and more likely to inhabit urban places, whether a small town or large metropolis, it is rare that we look carefully at the details and making of a place in such a way that we truly know the "genius loci" or spirit of the place. The unique meeting of the geographic underpinnings of a place, its natural resources and amenities that made it a likely place for settlement and the layers of design undertakings over time that build the structure of a city are critical to place-making. Knowing and understanding the environment is a critical piece of design education that can take many forms and be addressed through projects at many scales.&lt;BR&gt;  This course is designed to build your vocabulary for understanding the design of place and then provide opportunities to use your skills as teachers of art + design to translate that vocabulary into projects that can open up the designed world to young people. We will look at design of place and urban space from three vantage points relating to children: PLACES FOR CHILDREN; PLACES AND CHILDREN; and PLACES BY CHILDREN. To address these issues, we will conduct a series of design exercises exploring the urban environment working with scale, perspective, and mapping elements of the city's built and natural environment. In addition, we will look at the local and global role of sustainable design in the fields of architecture and urbanism and work to develop ways to present these integrated design challenges to young people.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Graduate requirement for MAT; Open to other Grads by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar course explores art and design within the context of the non-profit sector. It will examine the roles and responsibilities of non-profit arts organizations from both a practical and ideological perspective. The course will visit the realms of Providence / Boston-based arts non-profits, examining their lifecycles and the factors that shape an agency's success and/or failure. Organizations investigated include: arts councils, service organizations, arts centers, alternative spaces, residency programs, community-based initiatives, foundations, galleries and media-specific institutions. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the fundamentals of non-profits arts management including mission and vision, leadership, sustainability, relationships to the community and the public. The course is a combination of lecture, discussion, guest presentations, and site visits to various non-profit organizations. Students will be involved in fieldwork and in the development of a case study profile of a non-profit arts organization. This course will be of special interest to educators, artists, and designers whose professional lives are likely to intersect at some point with arts organizations and agencies.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; MA elective; Elective for other graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
