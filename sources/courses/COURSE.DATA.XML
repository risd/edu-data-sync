   <COURSETITLE>DSGN+ENTREPRENURIAL THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Entrepreneurship--the imagining, building and sustaining of socially impactful organizations--is a creative art. It requires insights and knowledge from the humanities and the social and physical sciences, and demands self-awareness and purpose. The premise of this lecture course is that designers and artists are uniquely gifted with critical entrepreneurial qualities. This course will allow students to better understand how and where their skills and perspectives fit into the world of entrepreneurship and business. The objective of Design and Entrepreneurial Thinking is for students to understand a basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities. This course seeks educate students to understand business as a critical design factor--a defining constraint or liberating perspective-along the same lines that other design principles are taught. This course will use HBS case notes, case studies, and recent business books to highlight this thinking. Students will be introduced to basic business concepts through lectures, case studies, assignments and class discussion. Homework assignments will work off the classroom pedagogy. Topics covered will be business models, marketing, finance, and strategy. A selection of homework assignments follows the lecture.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO BASIC SHOEMAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Apparel majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ID 2494 for ID majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Apparel majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ID 2494 for ID majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>As the field of wearable technology expands and fashion as art becomes more relevant, students will be challenged to explore the intersection of fashion, architecture and technology while using the body as a vehicle. This course will encourage new ways of thinking about body augmentation in space via innovative design, additive manufacturing and promote experimentation with materials that embrace technology. Through a series of workshops and assignments, students will also develop a working knowledge of traditional flat pattern making techniques, experiment with Lilypads, LEDs, smart fabrics, and thermochromic inks as well as learn to use generative techniques and the animation software Maya as modeling tools for the design of complex morphologies with an emphasis on researching strategies for the articulation of new fashion artifacts and architecture that will be 3D printed. Computer skills such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator are mandatory. Lab fee covers basic class materiels; 3D printing and resin costs are additional. &lt;BR&gt;  Architecture visiting faculty: Ludovico Lombardi of LDVC and Zaha-Hadid Architects, London and Designer Niccolo Casas of The Bartlett Apparel Design Faculty: Catherine Andreozzi, Associate Professor&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00 - $250.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>SKIN: ADORNMENT AND CRAFTED BARRIERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Skin"; the notion of this permeable barrier has captivated poets, architect's, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers. Both beautiful and macabre, the idea of skin excites and repels simultaneously. The void between jewelry and clothing begs to be investigated. Considering the broader definition of skin, how would you translate these histories, biological factors and psychological implications into body adornment and wearable's?  This course explores the intersection between jewelry and apparel by introducing materials and perspectives from both fields and beyond. A number of techniques will be introduced as a way to explore different notions of "skin". Materials such as leather, latex, textile, sheet metal and acrylic plastic will be introduced. The first part of the course is devoted to technical demos and collaborative exercises and lectures from both fields as well a leather factory visit. In the second part of the course students will do their own research and develop a project proposal based on their own interests. Students will receive weekly individual guidance and share their work through peer presentations and group critiques. The course will culminate in a public presentation.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; &lt;br&gt; Junior and above &lt;br&gt; Prerequisite: experience in jewelry or apparel is required. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced Studio in Architecture. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;  Section 01: Kyoto Japan A Collaged Reading of "The Water City"  &lt;br&gt; Trained collagists require the act of collage making to be contemplative, they know that there is something within the soul that longs to come forward, so they engage in collage making to advance it. To express this longing all the printed ephemera, forming the mirror world of modern existence, is mustered for use. Thousands of pictures of things varying in scale and perspective are conscripted to trigger trains of thoughts, comprehensible or not. Pictures are snipped without care for their actual context, and splicing together of this unique selection of things can begin. Acts are turned against pictorial depictions, recognizable or not. Things are done to pictures that have always wanted to be done but, because of circumstances, they never took place. Thendepending on the interest, skill, and dexterity, thoughts can be articulated. When the work is complete, a map of hunches exists and, due entirely to the act of making, the soul temporarily exorcised of what appeared to be coagulating within. Like all maps, collage can exist as a guide to what exists on the ground or it can prompt a new set of thoughts suggested by interconnections of terrain and cities. The activity of collage, like every visual activity, can profoundly alter the way things, places, and ideas are viewed." -(Ben Nicholson)  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Section 02 Paris, France Rural Architecture &lt;br&gt; In a recent article titled "Architecture in the Country" Rem Koolhaas observes radical changes in the rural landscape which are equally as important but more volatile than changes happening within cities. He calls this new pattern of development  "the intermediate - a well-manicured place where surface appearances bear almost no relation to what is actually happening on the land and in the buildings."  Koolhaas attributes the transformation partially to the flight of the traditional farmer due to industrial and digital practices and also to the influx of urbanites who regularly visit to "sample" the aura of an authentic life.  In addition, large-scale infrastructures have created zones of what biologist term "novel ecologies" where new combinations of flora and fauna co-exist. Koolhaas explains, "The countryside is now the frontline of transformation. A world formerly dictated by the seasons and the organization of agriculture is now a toxic mix of genetic experiment, science, industrial nostalgia, seasonal immigration, territorial buying sprees, massive subsidies, incidental inhabitation, tax incentives, investment, political turmoil. In other words, more volatile than the most accelerated city." &lt;br&gt;  Section 03: &lt;br&gt; The studio will emphasize techniques and design solutions, both passive and active, that determine the energetic performance of building enclosures. Methods of energy, thermal, and moisture simulations for whole buildings and individual building components will be utilized. The design will be influenced by the results of these simulations through an iterative process. Students will have the option to choose an UNESCO World Heritage Site by which to situate their project. These sites offer opportunities and constraints for design including, but not limited to, natural phenomena, historical precedents, vernacular context, climate, and program requirements. All of these requirements will be synthesized into a small, energy efficient visitor center tailored to the chosen site. &lt;br&gt;  Section 04: Augmented Body &lt;br&gt; Course is cross-listed as APPAR-3047-01.

   <COURSETITLE>RETHINKING GREEN URBANISM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As over half the world's population has come to live in cities, urbanization has moved to the center of the environmental debate. This course will provide an interdisciplinary engagement between Sociology and Architecture to reflect on the past, present and future of ecological urbanism. Co-taught by professors from Architecture and Liberal Arts, the seminar will interrogate the ways in which green urban design has been conceptualized to date. It will explore cutting edge contemporary debates around the future of the green urban project and ask students to think forward into the future.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Also offered as HPSS S151.

   <COURSETITLE>STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The basic content will be statics and strength of materials.  The first portion will deal with force vectors, trusses, cross-sectional properties, and shear/moment diagrams, followed by stresses, strains, material applications and the analysis procedures necessary to compute structural behaviors.  While the class format is mostly lecture, there will be ample time for discussion, in addition to group projects and field trips. This class is foundational to all future structural design classes such as Wood Structures and Steel Structures. The student will develop an intuitive understanding of structural behavior by studying various structural systems qualitatively under various loading conditions. The analysis of statically determinate trusses and frames will reinforce the intuitive understanding. Structural forces will be understood by tracing the loads (dead, live, wind, and seismic) through a building. They will be able to convert these loads into internal material stresses (axial, shear bending) for the purposes of proportioning members quantitatively. The relevant material sectional properties (such as moment of inertia and radius of gyration) will be learned through hands on bending and buckling experiments and later backed by quantitative analysis.  A math test will be given prior to the first class to determine which students are required to attend a supplemental lecture class instructed by the teaching assistant. This course is a pre-requisite for Steel Structures, Wood Structures, and Concrete Structures. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture Department;  Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Topics  include construction issues, floor framing systems, column analysis  and design, steel detailing and light gauge steel framing materials and systems.  In addition the course introduces students to lateral force  resistance systems in steel construction and exposes them to alternatives to steel such as aluminum and fiberglass. By the and of the course,  students will be aware of the role of metals in architectural design and construction; design and detail simple steel structural systems; and proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WOOD STRUCTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will review the fundamentals of wood in architecture with a focus on wood materials and construction systems and lumber and timber structural analysis and design.  Work includes timber systems consisting of conventional framing trusses, laminates, built-up sections and connections. In addition, this course will review the principles of structural loads; gravity, lateral, live and dead.  The concept of lateral resistance through standard wood framing systems will be explored. Manufactured lumber has become a major part of today's wood construction industry and the design and detailing of these materials will be explored in depth. By the end of the course, students will be aware of the role of wood materials in architectural design and construction and be able to design and detail simple Lumber and Timber structural systems.  They will be able to proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis.   This course will provide the student with a good understanding of the material and the common structural and architectural systems used in today's practice.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Requirement: ARCH majors only.&lt;br&gt; Registration by the Architecture Department.&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course reviews the fundamentals of concrete and masonry in architecture with a focus on materials, structural analysis and design.  The analysis and design  includes concrete structures, reinforced and pre-stressed concrete members, concrete foundations and reinforced  masonry. The student will  proportion concrete and masonry  structures using ultimate strength design.  The longer class time on  Tuesday  allows students to design, make a concrete mix and create a concrete object.  By the end of the course, the students will be  able to design and detail simple concrete and masonry systems such as footings, basement walls, beams and slabs; proportion these systems to resist the moment and shear demands determined through structural analysis; develop an understanding of proper detailing of architectural  concrete and masonry veneers by understanding thermal movements,  waterproofing, and construction techniques. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department. &lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course about becoming a licensed architect, a business professional and an active, engaged and responsible citizen.  It is intended to help prepare students for the challenges and opportunities confronted by a life in Architecture.  Lectures are organized around four themes: The architect as a trained and certified "Professional" in traditional and alternative careers; the architect as an operative in the world of business and commerce; the origins of architectural projects; and the detailed work performed through professional Architectural Contracts.   Regular panels, composed of RISD alums and other allied professionals provide an external perspective on all elements of the course, and allow students the opportunity to direct discussion in ways appropriate to their needs.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only.&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department. &lt;BR&gt; Course not available via web registration.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will research and discuss a variety of materials, their physical properties and their applications. Using furniture as our vehicle, we will explore how these materials might be utilized, beyond their original intent. We will also examine how the manipulation of these materials can create new ideas in furniture.  In the first half of the course students will research, view, handle, and discuss a variety of materials. In the second half, students will model and construct, either a 1/4 scale model, or a full scale detail of a piece of furniture using a material selected from the research done in the first half of the course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DEGREE PROJECT RESEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Serious research and a specific preparation begins in this course, forming the theoretical basis for the creative development of the Degree Project (Spring, 6 credits). This is a period in which the nature of the work is clarified, a process is developed, possibilities are examined, and research and information gathering completed.  The research from this course acts as an armature, establishing the attitude, objectives, and significance of the thesis as an exploration of architectural ideas, and forming the underpinnings for the work of the coming semester.  The result of this effort, begun in the fall with DP prep and completed in the spring, is gathered together and reflected in the DP Book as part of the requirements for completion of Degree Project. The work is reviewed at the end of Wintersession; satisfactory completion of this course is a prerequisite for the Degree Project in the Spring semester.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; ARCH majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Architecture department; course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Schedule to be determined with Advisor&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>How can timeless human activities such as drawing and painting, relegated to the realm of the analogue, meaningfully engage 3D modeling platforms like Rhino/Grasshopper and contemporary output methods such as 3D printing? How can we learn to intuit in the realm of the virtual and what are the boundaries of this experience? This course will allow new ways of "seeing" and "feeling" and use a computational framework in the design process. Rather than take a conventional approach based on the technical aspects of a specific software program, students will be exposed to a rich diversity of potential work flows. The goal of this course is enhancing personal craft and technique through these digital tools while exploring new potential approaches to advanced technology. The explanation of textile structures and the architecture of cloth will serve as a starting point for ideas.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Estimated Material Cost: TBD (base on Model Shop Fee Structure) &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as TEXT-4705.

   <COURSETITLE>CODING ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar addresses ideas, theories, and practices relating to computation in architecture and design. The course begins with the roots of computation long before the "personal computer" was conceived. The emphasis then shifts toward the present and a study of the canonical written contributions by design computation theorists and researchers (Knight, McCullough, Mitchell, Negroponte, Stiny, and others) as well related architectural, artistic, philosophical, and epistemological positions (Dewey, Evans, Klee, Lynn, Petherbridge, Schon, and others). In addition to reading and writing, the course is peppered with computational instruction so that students can confront and explore computation as makers as well as theorists. The seminar oscillates between reading/writing one week, then projecting the following week. Reading/writing weeks task students with a close reading of two texts and the composition of a written, critical, and analytic response. Project weeks follow, and call upon students to conceive, execute, and document a related experiment, prototype, or work of art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Junior and above&lt;br&gt; Major elective,open to non-majors and Brown students by permission&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FOUNDATIONAL TOPICS IN DESIGN COMPUTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In architectural practice, a working knowledge of design computation has gone from "nice to know" to "need to know". Many academic and professional institutions struggle to keep pace and  piece together their computational skill sets in an ad-hoc manner, adopting fragmented sources developed in contexts unrelated to architectural design. Students in this seminar will learn about foundational computational concepts tailored specifically towards architectural design. Students will learn how to incorporate the new reality of digital practice through assignments that include the structure of code and algorithms for computational geometry. Discussion topics include aggregation and tiling, early stage design setting tools, agent-based form generation, surface decomposition, optimization, and tools for collaboration.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; Elective, Open to non-majors&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>A MATERIAL IMAGINATION OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The seminar is grounded in the idea that the poetic and material imagination, inherent to the arts, affords us unique means of engaging the world and making a contribution. A series of discussions focus on the mechanisms and instruments of capital exchange including debt, equity, and compound interest, incorporation, and insurance. We explore the ontological impact of these instruments on our perception of time and space as well as the broader social issues of the capital markets as modes of resource distribution. Discussions cover a large arc including:  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; . Focus on words: exploring the links between language, individual agency, and collective judgment. &lt;BR&gt; . Focus on Space: examining many forms of exchange that occur between our spaces; the capacity of our interior thoughts to construct literate spaces; and spaces of participation inseparable from our memory and imagination. &lt;BR&gt; . Focus on links between: time, promises, words, space, empathy, ethics, and the creative disciplines and their social contracts.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Ultimately, the course explores the precisions of the poetic/material imagination as the most pragmatic means to address our social and political lives. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

To express this longing all the printed ephemera, forming the mirror world of modern existence, is mustered for use. Thousands of pictures of things varying in scale and perspective are conscripted to trigger trains of thoughts, comprehensible or not. Pictures are snipped without care for their actual context, and splicing together of this unique selection of things can begin. Acts are turned against pictorial depictions, recognizable or not. Things are done to pictures that have always wanted to be done but, because of circumstances, they never took place. Thendepending on the interest, skill, and dexterity, thoughts can be articulated. When the work is complete, a map of hunches exists and, due entirely to the act of making, the soul temporarily exorcised of what appeared to be coagulating within. Like all maps, collage can exist as a guide to what exists on the ground or it can prompt a new set of thoughts suggested by interconnections of terrain and cities. The activity of collage, like every visual activity, can profoundly alter the way things, places, and ideas are viewed." -(Ben Nicholson)  &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt; Section 02 Paris, France Rural Architecture &lt;br&gt; In a recent article titled "Architecture in the Country" Rem Koolhaas observes radical changes in the rural landscape which are equally as important but more volatile than changes happening within cities. He calls this new pattern of development  "the intermediate - a well-manicured place where surface appearances bear almost no relation to what is actually happening on the land and in the buildings."  Koolhaas attributes the transformation partially to the flight of the traditional farmer due to industrial and digital practices and also to the influx of urbanites who regularly visit to "sample" the aura of an authentic life.  In addition, large-scale infrastructures have created zones of what biologist term "novel ecologies" where new combinations of flora and fauna co-exist. Koolhaas explains, "The countryside is now the frontline of transformation. A world formerly dictated by the seasons and the organization of agriculture is now a toxic mix of genetic experiment, science, industrial nostalgia, seasonal immigration, territorial buying sprees, massive subsidies, incidental inhabitation, tax incentives, investment, political turmoil. In other words, more volatile than the most accelerated city." &lt;br&gt;  Section 03: &lt;br&gt; The studio will emphasize techniques and design solutions, both passive and active, that determine the energetic performance of building enclosures. Methods of energy, thermal, and moisture simulations for whole buildings and individual building components will be utilized. The design will be influenced by the results of these simulations through an iterative process. Students will have the option to choose an UNESCO World Heritage Site by which to situate their project. These sites offer opportunities and constraints for design including, but not limited to, natural phenomena, historical precedents, vernacular context, climate, and program requirements. All of these requirements will be synthesized into a small, energy efficient visitor center tailored to the chosen site. &lt;br&gt;  Section 04: Augmented Body &lt;br&gt; Course is cross-listed as APPAR-3047-01.

   <COURSEDESC>This course is intended to give students an in depth experience of both the conceptual and practical skills of architectural 3D modeling and rendering with a focus on the discovery, creation, and exploitation of systemic relationships within both architecture and its representation. This course will operate upon two thesis; that space has inherent qualitites beyond the physical/formal, and that architectural representation itself can be analyzed tectonically. These premises will inform and serve as subtext to the studio assignments which will build upon one another as conceptual strategies and representation techniques are introduced, explored and applied. Explorations will culminate in an individual studio project comprised of drawings, digital, models, and other media. &lt;br&gt;  Estimated Material Costs: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARCHITECTONICS: DRAWING THE UNSEEN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How do you draw what you have never see? Architects encounter this problem every day. The course will begin with a review of basic drafting techniques and will transition into multi-media exploration. Using established drafting techniques, students will be asked to generate drawings of buildings based on phenomenological themes. Drawings will move from abstract explorations of space into sited, programmed architectural works. Many architecture works only exist on paper. Many projects are never concretely realized. After a building is torn down, often only drawings remain. The history of un-built and demolisted architecture will be studied in tandem with drawing techniques. The existence of visionary architecture as a genre and the distinction between unbuilt and visionary designs will be studied as a compliment to learning about drafting techniques and a way to situate the projects. The motivations behind this work will be considered. At the conclusion of this course students will have 6 drawings suitable for inclusion in an architectural portfolio. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*SOUTH KOREA: SLICE OF LIFE STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We will begin by mapping the districts then gathering these maps into a limited Atlas. Next we will slice through 2 blocks of the living city (i.e. in modern Seoul a city block, Gang Nam Gu Block is one square kilometer and in the University District the block is an irregular 250 meters square)we will cut a section slicing through the living city block (a block in Gang Nam Gu is one square kilometer), accepting all that it reveals, ". from spoons to city.." Le Corbusier, and we will use our vastly different disciplines to comment on and to work into the cuts at many scales and in many manners. By looking at and working with topography, image, infrastructure, housing, institutions, educational viewpoint, culinary opportunity, energy, seasons, objects, context, furniture, mechanism, language, typography, gender, custom, costume, fashion, fabric, zoology, statics, statistics, agriculture, families, elders, shoppers, music. we will give an understanding of what is there now, how it interconnects, what seems to work well and what might not; a kind of disassembly and reassembly of physical fabric, geography, history, an urban portrait. In collaboration with the Mayors office we will establish criteria that can be addressed by design. With all this knowledge the students will design an individual work relevant to time and place, an addition or alteration, and as a group organize these works into a cumulative project that comments on and contributes to these neighborhoods. Finally we will gather the individual work in public review and organize it into a celebratory group exhibition and collected narrative. &lt;BR&gt;  The studio will be run with crits and pinups, invited outside critics for mid and final reviews and two exhibitions mid and final.  The final project needs to be organized for publication. Students are expected to be at work each studio day and to attend all crits and reviews. Student critique is invited at reviews.  &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $750.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This 6 credit studio is part of a 12 credit semester abroad to Seoul, South Korea &lt;br&gt; Open to Junior and above students from all departments &lt;br&gt;  Also offered as ARCH-21ST-03 for Architecture majors &lt;br&gt;  Off-Campus Study &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Ceramic Sculpture will cover a range of concepts, traditions and techniques that are specific to the disciplines of both ceramics and sculpture. &lt;BR&gt; Projects will revolve around the topics of space, structure and form. Techniques and processes including hand building, surface treatment and glazes will be covered. &lt;BR&gt; Clay is a very subtle medium and when one works in clay there is an exchange between the medium and the self.  Through making, your skills will become more developed giving you a higher sense of confidence with the medium while allowing for more control over the objects you wish to realize. Students will approach these dynamics through installation, large construction and small-scale object making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: CERAMICS AND CONTEPLATIVE PRACTICE IN JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This interdisciplinary studio-based course aims to deepen students' awareness and understanding of Japanese culture through a joint exploration of traditional ceramic techniques and contemplative practice while traveling and working in the Kansai region of Japan. Contemplative practices such as Zen meditation have influenced many uniquely Japanese cultural institutions, including tea ceremony and its ceramic wares, shodo and haiku. With an eye towards this relationship, this course will utilize daily meditation practice in tandem with a selection of related exercises as a complementary framework for studio investigations in clay. Engaging with such practices through both participatory and critical approaches, students will access a more integrated understanding of the culture in which they are immersed for the duration of the course. More broadly, they will develop an experiential awareness of the link between contemplative traditions and creative process.  &lt;BR&gt; Weekdays will be comprised of demonstrations and active work time at Kurumaki Studio in rural Nara Prefecture, Japan, where students will develop an understanding of fundamental ceramic techniques using the exceptional local clays. In the final week of the course, students will participate in the collaborative process of firing the resulting pieces in the anagama kiln using traditional wood-firing methods. Weekends will offer opportunities for venturing further afield to visit significant historical, architectural and cultural sites, with scheduled travel to Nara, Osaka, Kyoto and Naoshima.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required.&lt;br&gt; Registration begins in October at a time to be announced.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $4101.00, airfare not included. &lt;br&gt; ***Off-campus Study*** &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Ceramic Sculpture will cover a range of concepts, traditions and techniques that are specific to the disciplines of both ceramics and sculpture. &lt;BR&gt; Projects will revolve around the topics of space, structure and form. Techniques and processes including hand building, surface treatment and glazes will be covered. &lt;BR&gt; Clay is a very subtle medium and when one works in clay there is an exchange between the medium and the self.  Through making, your skills will become more developed giving you a higher sense of confidence with the medium while allowing for more control over the objects you wish to realize. Students will approach these dynamics through installation, large construction and small-scale object making.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MEDIA PERSPECTIVES: HISTORY OF MEDIA ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this historical survey, we analyze the aesthetic conventions, narratives, and formats of works in new media. We examine the impact digital technologies and new media have had on existing media, as well as the ways in which new media function as a unique system of communication. While investigating the aesthetic conventions, economic conditions and infrastructures that affect the production of new media, we address the social and political contexts in which new media are disseminated, interpreted and privileged. We make connections across decades by focusing on the recurring themes of language, futurism, simulation, hyper-reality, transnationality and information.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL MEDIA THESIS PREP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In  "On Permission to Write", essayist Cynthia Ozick distinguishes between the "good-citizen writer" and the "shaman-writer"  The first, she says, writes dutifully; the second, "obsessively", "torrentially", and most crucially, with self-given permission. For artists and designers who have, by and large, favored visual over written expression, obsession and torrent probably come more naturally in the studio than on the page. This course seeks to bring that same uninhibited, exploratory, and illuminating sensibility to the thesis, to suggest that writing is not a duty, but rather can be integral to studio practice. We will look at writing about one's work -- its art-historical, theoretical, and personal sources; its form and process; its motivation; its interpretation -- as a kind of translation from form to language (one that can be as individual and authentic as our chosen materials). The course will include writing exercises designed to help us think more deeply and coherently about our work and ideas, as well as discussion of assigned readings. The readings are exclusively written by artists and designers: criticism, manifestos, journal writings, and artist interviews - a selection intended to suggest that in permitting themselves to write, artists and designers establish artistic agency, lineage, and history itself through that writing.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graduate major requirement, Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to second-year graduates&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Installation Sight &amp; Sound is a studio course where students may create installations, performances, or site-specific works that incorporate screenprinting techniques as a primary medium. Students are encouraged to create experiences that transform the gallery setting or exist outside it. The course is open to students of every disciple and allows for cross-media experimentation. Print will be used and viewed as a drawing and sculptural tool that can be combined with your other technical/digital knowledge and experience. Students will be challenged to explore and invent new ways of utilizing Printmaking in their work, and will be encouraged to transform and reutilize space through interdisciplinary experimentation, and to begin to think about surfaces other than walls for the display of work. In the first half of the semester, students will conduct research, experiment with a variety of screenprinting techniques, offer short presentations of past work, and collaborate on midterm projects. In the second half of the semester, students will form final project proposals, and then work collaboratively or individually on a self-directed final. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;br&gt;Also offered as PRINT-4520.&lt;br&gt; Registration by Printmaking department; course is not available via web registration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL + MEDIA THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As critical phenomenology, the aim of this course is to influence two acts, how to see and how to critique digital media, as extension of unresolved conceptual and aesthetic problems and as catapult for entirely original practice and possibility. The approach is the 'theoretical crit' that students write each week in response to readings, methods, problems, and works closely explored. As in contemporary art, new media's objects and theories are becoming increasingly interdependent. Thus, rather than using theory to evaluate artwork, we examine both work and theory, coming to contemporary, formal, critical, and instrumental voice through which to respond to assumptions and aspirations of each.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to first-year graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIG MEDIA GRAD WRITTEN THESIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar includes intensive group writing sessions. Individual meetings also will be conducted to support each student in assembling a comprehensive written thesis. Centrally our task together is to understand and evaluate actual studio work and to communicate this clearly and effectively within a comprehensive document. To accomplish this we will address: thesis rationale, development of concepts, source material, context relevant philosophical, aesthetic and theoretical issues as well as working process. Structure, layout, documentation, and the mechanics of formatting will also be explored in depth.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Digital + Media majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Digital + Media department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Open to second-year graduate&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>From the Avant-Garde to Youtube is a seminar and studio based class. The seminar is a survey of the moments in art history in which artists engage with a new time-based medium: the European Avant-Garde with cinema, Performance Art, Conceptual Art, and Fluxus with analog video and video installation, contemporary artists with digital video, global network distribution platforms, and video games. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The seminar and the technical workshops (HD video shooting, lighting, video editing, multi-screen video installation, live video performance, and projection mapping) are designed to foster and create a shared language from which students can develop their personal time-base works within the course. Artist case studies include Dziga Vertov, Nam June Paik, Ryan Trecartin, anonymous-memes-creators, and drones, readings include Lev Kuleshov, Rosalind Krauss, Nicolas Bourriaud, Lev Manovich, and Hito Steyerl.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What is the sound of a deep blue sky? What color is thunder? What rhythms does a skyline have? This studio course will explore the neurological condition of synesthesia - the perception of two or more senses as intrinsically linked - and investigate how artists might use a synesthetic approach towards their relationship with place. Through interdisciplinary experimentation, students will be challenged to discover their own idiosyncratic relationships among the senses, and to create work that interprets their experience of place in surprising and authentic ways. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VIRTUAL FORM: EXPERIMENTS IN 3D MODELING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the impact of computer based 3d modeling, with special attention to the history of illusionistic representation on the one hand, and generative and algorithmic approaches to form on the other.&lt;BR&gt; How have special effects, video games, architectural renderings, or simulations such as Google Earth changed the way we engage space, or are they simply a continuation of perspectival illusions created in the Renaissance? How can artists and designers use or hack these digital mediums in their own work? How do algorithmic approaches to form differ from mimetic or illusionistic approaches to form? &lt;BR&gt; The course will look at various 3d modeling techniques as well as different methods of outputting or presenting 3D models, including rendering images, creating animations, or using fabrication techniques such as lasercutters and rp machines to produce physical models. The main goal of the course is to help students develop a working methodology for integrating 3d modeling into their own practice. The course will not focus on any single software, but will examine a wide range of media and computer software that can be used or hacked by students, from Google Earth, to video game engines, and from xtranormal.com to Maya and 3ds Max, from simple tools to scripting and programming 3d form. The course is open to both beginners and students with experience in 3D modeling&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; graduate level&lt;br&gt; Open to senior, fifth-year, space permitting. &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH PROJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class takes the form of a series of group meetings to explore work related to student selected research projects. Each student may work on his/her own project, or work with the instructor and students to facilitate a particular research venture as part of a team. Students develop proposals for individual or a team based projects. This class also facilitates group critiques.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Participants will explore research methodologies and various forms of research as material, social, and symbolic creative practice. Lectures and workshops about technical, political, and practical aspects of research will support individual and group student work. The course design will be flexible depending on the topic areas of interest to individual students. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Please contact the instructor with any questions and for more details.&lt;br&gt; Open to graduate students and upper level undergraduates from both Architecture and Design and Fine Arts Divisions. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Have you ever been confused by wars and chaos from news on TV endlessly? Do you know some ngligible action we did in daily life may actually cause serious conflicts on the other side of the world? Do you want to know more about how and why people are fighting each other violently with a reason that never makes sense to us? What can we do to make this world a better, or at least more interesting as an artist or designer? &lt;br&gt; This course focuses on war, conflict, and destruction as resources for creative perspectives and practices. War is a part of human activities across history that constantly takes place and changes our world. The violent and destructive power of the war machine are effective not only in ware, but also in everyday life. It is placed outside of social apparatus in a hidden state, protecting the utopia we live in. we will inspect different types of war machines in metaphorical or non-metaphorical forms, investigate how this irresistible mechanism and system generate power, and how these power have impact on us. We will introduce selected wars in 20th century and investigate how art and design are shaped for conflicts. Some movies, novels and video games will also be included in discussion. &lt;br&gt; People to be referenced: &lt;br&gt; Sun Tsu, Thomas Hobbes, Carl von Clausewitz, Marshall McIuhan, Jean Bauldrillard, Gilles Deleuze, Chen Zhen, Cai Guo Qiang, Ren Jian, Lai Sheng Yuan, Ralph Borland, Lee Je-Rim, Cody Wilson, and more. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE: A STUDY OF OUR MYTHICAL PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What perpetuates myths? How is new media utilized to explore and/or distort an objective truth?&lt;br&gt; All contemporary media presents us with a tacit narrative. The viewer discerns whether or not that narrative is true, false or somewhere in-between. By examining and utilizing myth as a method a convey meaning, this class will attempt to explore the role of technology as it both creates and debunks anecdotal theories.  &lt;br&gt; Students will examine how systems of belief, such as conspiracy theory and superstition are created, and the means by which they are perpetuated and spread through various media. Drawing insporation from these tenets, we will explore how anecdotal evidence is used to construct an instance of narrative that blends both fact and fiction. &lt;br&gt;  The goal of this course is for students to experiment with text, images, video, installation, sculpture, digital media and more in order to create their oun evidentiary trace, myth, or tenet that is inspired by, or extrapolates, real world events. Students will produce work that critically interprets secondary and primary research drawn from a variety of disciplines and practices, including but not limited to archaeology, literature, history and science. Using this apprach, students will learn to work across a continuum in order to critically, creatively and intellectually build, nurture, and stustain an independent artistic practice. Classwork will encourage an array of possible outputs ranging from factual to fictional, hypothetical to speculative, literal to metaphorical which will exist as detritus, evidence or as a consequence of research. &lt;br&gt; In this studio/seminar class, we will read texts from different disciplines ranging from literature to theory, historical to science fiction and beyond. A practice of writing will be encouraged as a means to simultaneously support each students' research and studio practice. We will have visiting artists and researchers from various fields, as well as site visits and weekly screenings. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $75.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WILLIAM GIBSON</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From his seminal Cyberpunk text Neuromancer to this more recent Science Fiction work set 10 seconds from now, this class will trace the course of his work and its influence on Design, Art and Media Culture. Part of the research will be looking at references both found in his texts and work made in response to them. Future thinking will be studied as a critique of the present and an interpretation of the past. The students will first draw direct inspiration from their readings in a collaborative project, helping each other to create a part of Gibson's world. They will use this time to work through practical and technical challenges in New Media and creative technologies. The second have will ask them to then move into models of new cultural imagining, creating a work that reflects their own relationsohip to technology. The class will end by attempting to define the function of Science Fiction and future thinking, as a way of responding to contemporary issues. &lt;br&gt; Each week will be based around the limited readings of each of Gibson's major trilogies. This chronological bibliographical structure will allow us to place in historical context the work going into and coming out of these major story arcs. Select passages will be assigned from all books, with only one of them (student's choice) to be read in full by end of term. as we cover major topics, a few key articles will be used to springboard in class discussion.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE MIND AT HAND: SENTIENT SKILL AND TIME-BASED MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our relationships are what allow us to validate our sentience. What then does it mean to move in to a time where technology plays a large role in creating and influencing these relationships? Through investigations of personal experience, we will gain insight into the things that enable us to recognize what we perceive as alive. This course will focus on the role of the hand in our technology driven society. &lt;br&gt; The hands-on portion of this course will focus on the use of time-based media in conjunction with experimental methods. Through a series of exercises and projects, a variety of media and materials will be introduced. We will focus on simple motors and motor control, video, installation, documentation and material studies. As a group we will explore new materials and the way in which they react to the hand. Through this playful experimentation we will generate individual translations of sensory information, reflecting on the intentional vs the unintentional; connecting the hand and mind. &lt;br&gt; The content of this course is significant because as makers we need to understand the role of the hand in technology driven world, and understand how to successfully document and share our work. This course is very much about experimentation and play, but will engage with theoretical underpinnings. Readings will draw from Sherry Turkle, Yi-Fu Tuan, Sophie Calle, Heidegger, and Malcolm McCullough among others. Students are expected to experiment with new methods and materials, and although playful investigation is encouraged, projects must be grounded in thoughtful engagement with the topics of discussion. &lt;Br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART, BIO AND EVERYTHING BUT THE KITCHEN SINK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean when an artist engineers a glowing GFP bunny and calls it "transgenic artwork"? What does it mean when an artist cultures her own vaginal cells to make a statement on modern sexuality? What does it mean when an artist is conducting research? How does it differ from a scientist who creates a transgenic organizm or culture cells? Context? Is this appropriation? Is this a compelling metaphor? Is this art? Or one ste further, what happens if an artist doesn't fully realize a project involving a biological phenomena or what if the artwork only utilizes biology through wordplay? What if this work is speculative or something we cannot see? Is this poetic? If not visual or something real, is it writing? Can you relate this type of "visualization" of a vision to what happesn in a single particle analysis in Cryo-EM? &lt;br&gt; As biological and medical advances and issues pervade our everyday lives, it becomes increasingly compelling to engage with the world of science as a source of content and media. However, working with biology or another discipline is not only one of technical challenges (i.e. how to tailor a scientific method, to technically culture the cells, or even to raise an organism) but rather conceptual and philisophical challenges. Why do we use biology as a medium? What does it mean to use the language of science? How does language and metaphor come into play? Instead of using science purely as content or as fodder for discussion about scientific issues, can we use it to discuss pressing issues in art? &lt;br&gt; This course will incompletely cover and explore the work and practices that engage with science and biology, some of the world and history of BioArt (i.e. Eduardo Kac, Marc Quinn, etc.), as well as art and artists that don't identify with biology or science at all (i.e. Ursula Von Rydinsvard, Alan Kaprow). We will also delve into the nitty gritty science that you haven't touched since high school (i.e. cell biology, viral replication?), teach you some bio tricks (i.e. DNA extraction, cell culture, microscopy), and the wonderfully confusing world of poetics (i.e. Bachelard), metaphor (read George Lakoff and Laura Otis), word play, and a pinch of theoru. &lt;br&gt; This course ask students to face the uncomfortable unknown and suspend their beliefs and understandings. It asks students to be comfortable blurring concepts, conventions, and ideas to create blurry gray areas. In the midst of all this uncertainty, students will work thoughtfully and rigorously to understand what it means to consider art an investigative endeavor like science research. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Physical Computing is an introduction to low-level electronic technologies such as sensors, microcontrollers, display technologies and motors. We will review the basics of electricity and microcontrollers (one-chip computers). A wide range of sensors, and output technologies will be presented, and demonstrated so that students have a sense of currently available low-cost technologies that are available for artwork and their course work.  &lt;br&gt; The hardware on which the course will be based is low-cost wireless microcontroller modules and a basic array of sensors and interface tech. The modules can be used to record data from the body wirelessly, or to harvest user information from a gallery installation. The modules can also be used to drive output systems, such as displays, sound, or motors. Students will also be expected to pursue technology that interests them including specialized sensors and output devices.  &lt;br&gt; If there is class interest and time we can construct our own printed circuit boards, to show students how to "close the loop" between the roles of consumers and constructors of hardware based electronic systems.  &lt;br&gt;  Readings and discussions will interrogate some of the latest tech industry jargon such as the "Internet of Things" and the place that robots and automation might have in the future, as well as writings by artists working with technology. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; graduate level&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, fifth-year, space permitting. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore the technical and conceptual fundamentals of computer programming in the broader context of a sustained studio practice. In addition to teaching basic software coding skills from the ground up, the course will focus on the social and historical backgrounds of these technologies and how they shape the growth of media, identity, politics and the everyday. Related works from the contemporary art and design fields will be examined, ranging from visual, performance and sound art to architecture, product design and beyond. Students will be expected to engage with computer coding and related technologies conceptually or technically in their studio work. &lt;BR&gt; The course will consist of introductory exercises in computer programming, discussions of articles related to contemporary digital media, frequent critiques, and an intensive final project that pushes the boundaries of computer coding as a creative tool. Mistakes, pitfalls and frustrations will be expected and encouraged as students navigate this quickly changing medium. No prior programming experience is necessary. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this interdisciplinary design/research laboratory, students will explore image-making technologies across a range of media. Each week, students will be introduced to a new material, tool or technique, from which they will investigate and contrive their own imaging experiment. Each experiment will be used to evaluate the process by which it is derived, a pattern aimed at helping students evolve key insights while developing systematic approaches for creative investigation. From early chemical procedures to advanced high-speed cameras and gigapixel photographs, to 3D scanning and depth-imaging techniques, to code-based camera systems controlled by sensors, to custom-built robotics and aerial drones, this lab will treat each process as a unique visual investigation. The extent of the class is to acquire creative-imaging workflows that serve within the larger context of a professional design or arts-based practice. Some background in either graphic design or photography, physical-computing and/or computer programming is helpful but not required. &lt;BR&gt;   &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SCREEN/WALL/CANVAS/FIELD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will investigate notions of surface as material ground for projected light/images, as visual, sensory and cognitive zones of expanded space, and as landscape for actual and psychogeographic exploration. &lt;br&gt; By exploring the sites of wall/canvas/screen/field as locations where materials, surfaces and contexts combine, we will see how architecture, film/video, digital media, textiles, painting, land art, sculpture and fashion, are mediated by surface relations. In our contemporary context, these relations often fuse together, pass through, or bounce off each other, and so accrue as layered complexities of space and materiality, which, in the words of Guiliana Bruno, operate as 1"mediated transfers of states of mid, feelings, and moods unfolding between persons across surface space." &lt;br&gt; These concepts will be introduced through readings, lectures and studio projects. Students will be encouraged to bring their own work into the conversation and re/consider it through class discussion around these topics, so as to develop and challenge their current practice. &lt;br&gt; This course is inspired by Guiliana Bruno 2014 book "Surface: Aesthetics, Materiality &amp; Media" which will be a core text. &lt;br&gt; We will consider works by the following (amongst others): Robert Irwin, James Turrell, Tacita Dean, Anthony McCall, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Luis Barragan, Isaac Julien, Wong Kar-wai, Sophie Tottie, Krzystof Wodiczko, Tara Donovan, Sarah Oppenheimer, Robert Wilson, The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI), Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Maya Lin, Brian Tolle, and Gordon Matta-Clark.  &lt;Br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;  Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Transparency offers both the ability to look at and look through media.  Reflection, refraction, projection, and absorption are just the starting points for a dialogue involving the material and representational implications of painting and glass.  Through hands on interface between these two disciplines we will strive to create alternative possibilities for aiding and altering vision. The class structure will promote collaboration between students with differing skills and technical backgrounds. The class will solicit active exchange and crossover all semester long.  Independent research and collaborative studio work will be asked of everyone.   Readings and lectures will cover theories and artists surrounding the topics of vision, imaging, projection, representation, and transparency.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Color pervades and persuades all that we do in the visual world.  Color scholarship can step and stage our own projects.  This course will expand our knowledge of color through examples of watermedia.  Qualitative looking at historical collections, comparative analyses of artists' or designers' color methods and materials, and an interpretation of color models in ink, gouache or watercolor will deepen our understandings.  The class will investigate particular color characteristics in translucency, tonal sequencing, color interaction, and phenomenal hue effects through 10 guided quick projects.&lt;br&gt;  During the course students will evaluate selections from the body of 600 British watercolors in the RISD Museum for color cues and material use.  A range of contemporary color watermedia works will be viewed in galleries to better understand and question newer applications, trends and inventions.  A color reader will accompany students' visual studies.  Each participant in this seminar will complete a comparative color analysis of a historical and contemporary work with a review of methods, means and contexts.  How, for instance, does the artist or designer order tasks in each piece to distinguish a color voice?  Which way does the nature of the color medium heighten meaning?  The course's final assignment consists of the presentation of students' self-selected color topic with a responsive and corresponding body of watermedia work.  It is hoped that an adopted feedback strategy will contribute both to a period of self-reflection and ultimately inform a larger conceptual framework for students' own original work.  It is primary goal of this course to provide students with a research-based foundation to enhanced color acuity in an artist's or designer's studio work.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $25.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as LAEL-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

Technical concerns such as exposure, focus, depth of field, and basic editing conventions are covered. Aesthetic concerns such as composition, movement, editing rhythms, and the filmmaker's intention are discussed and critiqued. Students complete three individual assignments outside of class, and four in-class exercises in pairs or groups. The individual assignments encourage creative use of editing techniques such as traditional match-cutting, graphic match-cutting, and cross-cutting or parallel editing. The first individual project is silent, but for those that follow, students create soundtracks using elements such as effects, music, ambient sound, and voiceover.  Screenings in class include student rushes, works in progress, and finished films. In addition, a variety of short films are screened and discussed that relate to many of the techniques and aesthetic considerations explored throughout the semester.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $220.00  Deposit: $150.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by FAV department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required for nonmajors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTORY FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Intro Film explores techniques of live action 16MM film production using Bolex cameras and flatbed editing tables. Technical concerns such as exposure, focus, depth of field, and basic editing conventions are covered. Aesthetic concerns such as composition, movement, editing rhythms, and the filmmaker's intention are discussed and critiqued. Students complete three individual assignments outside of class, and four in-class exercises in pairs or groups. The individual assignments encourage creative use of editing techniques such as traditional match-cutting, graphic match-cutting, and cross-cutting or parallel editing. The first individual project is silent, but for those that follow, students create soundtracks using elements such as effects, music, ambient sound, and voiceover.  Screenings in class include student rushes, works in progress, and finished films. In addition, a variety of short films are screened and discussed that relate to many of the techniques and aesthetic considerations explored throughout the semester.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $220.00  Deposit: $150.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by FAV department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Permission of instructor required for nonmajors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a course demonstrating and exploring the basic techniques of Stop-Motion Puppet Animation, with the intent to provide students with hands-on creative experience in learning the potentials of the medium, and an introduction to filmic language. Studio exercises strengthen individual technical skills in basic armature construction and model making, animating pose-to-pose movement, the basic walk, expressions and gestures, clay animation with lip-sync, set construction and lighting for three-dimensional animation. Basic sound recording, mixing and editing are also covered. Conceptual skills are exercised through exploring intent, storytelling, storyboarding, editorial concepts, character performance, art direction, and basic sound design. This class is based on process and experimentation. It is meant to provide a strong foundation in the basics of stop-motion animation filmmaking, as well as the confidence to experiment further in one's future work. The idea is to enjoy the process by understanding it; control is born of experimentation and experience.&lt;br&gt; This is a one semester class repeated in the spring.

   <COURSETITLE>DIRECTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the Directing class, students are encouraged to go beyond the first instinct or idea, and to develop a project to its fullest potential, particularly with respect to meaning and to potential modes of execution. Students work on a variety of scenes throughout the semester, complete several short assignments during and outside of class, and read handouts and excerpts from texts. An ongoing focus throughout the semester is an exploration of the methods of communication between directors and actors. Students direct each other, young actors from the Carriage House School, professional actors from the community (brought in for two classes), and actors of their choosing for final projects. As they direct rehearsals, students utilize a variety of specific tools that enable them to maximize the creativity and fertility of their relationships with actors, and to make adjustments in performances quickly and effectively. The latter third of the semester also focuses on techniques for script analysis. These are used to discover the range of creative possibilities in a given text, and to thoroughly prepare and organize directors for rehearsals and shoots. An ongoing, general goal of the course is also for each student to reflect upon and identify their personal themes as a director.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CHARACTER ANIMATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses primarily on hand-drawn character design, development, and movement. Beginning with simple model sheets drawn from different points of view, we explore how action and context can affect the design of characters. The same characters are then taken straight into animation. Students use the characters they created as actors who must perform in a variety of situations, and interact directly with the physical space around them. Exercises include walk cycles, lip-synching, anticipation and follow-through, weight and resistance, and lessons in narrative, storyboarding, and drawing skills. The class also takes a field trip to the Roger Williams Zoo to study animal motion directly from life. A longer, three-week final project provides an opportunity for students to show what they have learned, and to create a cohesive story from start to finish. The final project is usually critiqued by a guest industry professional. All supporting software is covered in a series of simple workshops. Class time involves critiques of homework assignments, demonstrations of techniques and screenings of a diverse range of films.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Students explore the structure and grammar of three-dimensional space using hands-on methods. We investigate the symmetries and transformations of polyhedra by constructing and deconstructing study models.  Stability, mobility, tensegrity, and dome structures are evaluated, and students are encouraged to apply the principles learned to architectureal and sculptural designs.  Students experiment with pencils, paper, compasses, straight edges, scissors, exacto-knives, sticks, and joints, to discover concepts before they are named.  Fundamental principles of organization are emphasized and rote memorization of definitions discouraged.  The course will stress method, experiments, and risk taking.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WHAT'S A WEEK? A SURVEY OF TIME-KEEPING SYSTEMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The subject of time is one of the most elusive and mysterious This course examines the history of how humans measure, discuss,  and keep time. Time-keeping has evolved in its many manifestations and types, from physical and earth-based system to solar/lunar  systems, to sacred and secular time. We will not look at the physics or philosophical aspects of time, i.e. whether time exists, but  rather the myriad ways in which humans think about, classify , talk about and operate in continual change, whether rapid or glacial,  physical or abstract. &lt;BR&gt;   The first goal is to provide an understanding of the diverse ways in which time is ordered, to examine and name the ways in which  each system is structured around a natural force or phenomenon The second goal of the course is to introduce each participant to the  literature and research on the subject in order to be able to continue with individual inquiry and research at some future point. We will  explore the various kinds of time through lectures, discussions, assigned readings and through class and individual studio projects  and research. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Explore innovative means of documenting, interpreting, and presenting the microscopic life of our nearby waters, including the Providence River and Narragansett Bay.  Through a series of related projects, students will develop understanding of context and technical expertise, beginning with hands-on gathering of plankton and environmental source materials, developing skill with microscopic technology while learning about plankton as the most basic part of the food chain.   The course will culminate in a group installation of individual and collaborative projects, implementing Augmented Reality as part of the interpretive/documentary process.  An interest in integrating digital technology into innovative conceptual work is more important than microscope and computer skills, as we will work together to learn necessary technology. Students will have the opportunity to collaborate with oceanographers, including the option to work with unique imagery from Antarctica and other distant locations.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $30.00&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE FUTURE OF CRITICAL MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio will explore the relationship between technology, material, and expression.   &lt;BR&gt; Industrial robots are among the most universal devices, suitable for an extremely wide range of fabrication and material processes. Commonly used in automotive production and other high-volume production settings, robots are now increasingly implemented in the production of art, architecture, and design. Robotic fabrication seems to promise an unprecedented opportunity for artists and designers to engage process as a mode of exploration. The Future of Critical Making, a unique studio in the global design technology landscape, will expand on research strategies and design opportunities developed by the instructors over the last decade of material exploration, process development, and digital making to provide students from all disciplines an opportunity to advance their practice though technological integration.   &lt;BR&gt; This studio will foster the development, evaluation, and application of novel digital design-to-robot fabrication workflows for the creation, experimentation, and application of a variety of tools, processes, and systems tailored specifically to individual areas of interest and specific perceived opportunities within all represented disciplines. Throughout the course instructors will seek to enhance the fundamental practice of making while integrating design technologies that are shaping the contemporary practice of art, design, and architecture; an effort that will help students emerge as a leaders in  the integration of design technology that embraces, rather than sacrifices, a profound material understanding. Rather than focusing on approaches to robotics that are technology-driven, the studio will approach technological applications with a profound reverence and understanding of traditional material techniques.  The ability to apply innovative and experimental applications to robotic technology will be driven by student's unique position of promoting tacit sensibility within material and process within a range of disciplines and modes of art and design practice.   &lt;BR&gt; The course will begin with hands on exercises to develop an understanding of the computational and robotic workflows needed to begin a series of independent and group exercises whereby students will explore the relationship between emergent technologies and their own sensibilities as artists and designers. The studio is open to students from all disciplines with the goal of exploring as many potential opportunities to leverage novel technologies in the pursuit of making. No specific skills are required and the studio is open to all skill levels with prior instructor approval.   &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 &lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE BIG PICTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Some skills are built up through drill and repetition; others are acquired over the long haul.  In this class, students will work on one, very large, full color narrative drawing for the duration of the session.  This course will give students the valuable time and space to focus on a large-scale project for an extended period of time. &lt;BR&gt; We will explore narrative, design, and storytelling in art throughout the history and cultures of the world, including diverse examples ranging from bas-relief to frescoes to board games to Advent calendars.  &lt;BR&gt; The works must be on paper, but the medium is open to the student and experimentation is highly encouraged.  Students will have access to large rooms with significant wall space that enable them to get perspective on their work. Students must be prepared to dedicate time to their drawing both in and outside of class sessions; and must be highly motivated and organized.  Group critiques will be held for the initial compositional layouts and for the final pieces.  Other critiques will occur as needed, with the instructor providing guidance and feedback throughout. The group studio will result in an energetic atmosphere that will support the development and completion of these colossal projects.  &lt;BR&gt; This class is open to all departments and years of study.  &lt;br&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $150.00 </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing is studied as a flexible, generative process that engages and challenges historical conventions. Using a range of materials, students structure space through the manipulation of formal compositional elements. Within abstract and representational work, the character of lines, tones, and marks are studied as inseparable from the concept and content of drawings. Students are challenged to see their drawings as independent entities that must exist apart from references. Drawing embodies a connection to a rich tradition as well as a contemporary response to the world.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DATA NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will explore new interactions, pursuing spaces between the arts, sciences, and humanities, between people and technology, systems and natural networked connections. We will search for the stories in the data. As artists and designers we will concern ourselves with creating new forms of schematic expression that aim to capture the qualities of human experience. &lt;br&gt;   Currently, there is an unprecedented melding of the arts, sciences and humanities. Vast amounts of information and collaboration opportunities are at our disposal. This information, often referred to as "data" has become part of our popular discourse. Data visualization is regularly promoted for its ability to reveal stories within data, yet these "data stories" differ in important ways from traditional forms of storytelling. Storytellers, scientists, and journalists have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story.  &lt;br&gt;   How do we as artists and designers combine information? How do we remix existing "data" and make something new? What sorts of input/output schemes can we conceive to develop generative processes? We will work with scientist, and search through specific sets of data to answer some of these questions, by exploring the narratives within the data. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;  Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Its purpose is to meet individual student needs by providing an alternative to regularly offered courses, though it is not a substitute for a course if that course is regularly offered.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WITNESS TREE PROJECT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Witness trees, as designated by the National Park Service, are long-standing trees that have "witnessed" key events, trends, and people in history. In this joint studio/liberal arts course, students have the unique opportunity to study and work with a fallen witness tree, shipped to RISD from a national historic site. The course will involve three components: 1) a field trip to the tree's site at the beginning of the semester; 2) classroom-based exploration of American history, memory, landscape, and material culture; and 3) studio-based building of a series of objects from the tree's wood, in response to both the site and students' classroom study. Overall, the course will explore both how material artifacts shape historical understanding and how historical knowledge can create meaningful design. Wood this year has been designated from the Martin Van Buren National Historic Site in Kinderhook, New York. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Students must also register for HPSS S732&lt;br&gt;Students will receive 3 credits in Furniture and 3 credits in HPSS, for a total of 6 credits&lt;br&gt; A single fee of $100.00 will be charged for your concurrent registration in HPSS S732/FURN 2451 courses.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Long known as the "Beehive" of industry, Providence RI is one of the most diverse manufacturing hubs in the US.  Although today's global market continues to absorb these resources, Providence has retained a highly skilled manufacturing center that is eager to work with the creative arts. This rare resource provides designers the unique ability to work locally with manufacturing re-sources from traditional lost wax casting to emerging manufacturing technologies such as laser cutting, multi-axis cnc, and rapid prototyping. Throughout the course we will visit manufacturing, marketing, and retail facilities to develop a working understanding of production processes and methods available to you and how best to effectively implement these resources into your work as a designer/artist.  The studio course will conclude with each student presenting a finished production ready object in multiples along with supporting marketing materials. By approaching this class from a design, manufacturing, and marketing perspective students will acquire a practical knowledge of production strategies essential to the success of a designer today. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Lighting design is an ever-growing category of furniture and product design, constantly evolving alongside technological advances in available lamp hardware. This hands-on course is an opportunity for students to explore the various types of lamp options, including incandescent, halogen, fluorescent, and LED.  Students are first provided with the technical skills and safety factors involved in creating and wiring a lamp, to adding more complicated items such as switches, dimmers, and hardware, and finally moving on to designing and creating a body of functional lighting pieces. We will cover various lamp typologies (sconces, floor lamps, table lamps, chandeliers, pendants, etc), as well as light as art through installation and sculpture. Students are encouraged to work in a variety of materials and scales, developing their designs from sketches, models, and renderings, to a fully realized object. Designs will evolve through in-class discussions, pin-ups, and critiques. This class will focus on the design and fabrication of lighting as an object in a space, rather than the lighting of a space.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $50.00 - $100.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective for Majors and Non-Majors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTS IN WEAVING FURNITURE AND FORM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The design of Furniture requires an understanding of the relationship between function, form and the body. The balancing of each of these elements is essential to the creation of a successful piece. Weaving, at its most basic, can be understood as the interlacing of individual elements into a complex whole. What does it mean to weave a 3 Dimensional form that must provide support and comfort, as is the case found in the design of Furniture?   &lt;BR&gt; This course will focus on exploring the process of weaving, as applied to the art and design of Furniture. With an emphasis on experimentation, students will be encouraged to utilize  non-traditional materials and invented techniques. Through twisting, folding, bending, overlapping, tying, and knotting materials both bought and found will be interwoven to create new and exciting possibilities.   &lt;BR&gt; We will begin a series of quick investigations into materiality and connection that will evolve rapidly into 3 dimensional forms. The information and experience gained from these initial exercises will then be expanded upon to inform the design and creation of a final, refined Furniture piece. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class  serves as an interface between the new technologies of digital and the old technologies of optics.  New digital technologies are given alternative possibilities with the addition of specific projection apparatus (in terms of both, projection optics and projection surfaces), plays with reflection (such as the construction of anamorphic cylinders, zoetropes, and other optical devices), and in the fabrication of project specific lenses.  Given the hands-on nature of the glass department, the actual making and/or subversion of traditional optics is possible. The class encourages collaborative work between students of varying experience levels and fosters the incorporation and dialogue between students of the two differing areas of expertise.&lt;br&gt; Course also offered as D+M 7009.

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF GLASS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Egyptian vessels to skyscrapers, glass has been central to every aspect of life. In a chronological sequence, this course explores the progress and purpose of glass making and its artistic, practical, or psychological effects. Several sessions will be devoted to conceptual themes such as glass as a thinking tool (glass and science), as a technology for sight and introspection (windows and mirrors), and as a path to divinity (medieval stained glass; Islamic glass). Powerpoint-based lectures will foster interaction among the participants with weekly readings as a basis for discussion. A website (an e-portfolio on digication) will enhance the communication between students, the instructor, and the teaching assistant while allowing everyone to post ideas, comments, and visuals. Several visits to the RISD Museum are planned to view both the permanent collections and pieces from storage. Students are expected to give an oral presentation on a theme or an object of their choice.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement for junior BFA.GLASS students&lt;br&gt;Liberal Arts elective credit for nonmajors on a space available basis.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLASS SCULPTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The first objective of this experimental glass class is to investigate the potential of glass as a sculptural material. This rigorous exploration entails many non-traditional and some traditional techniques with hot and cold glass. Some of the techniques students will learn are: innovative molds for blown and cast glass; assembling glass (cutting, gluing); unusual manipulations of hot glass; combinations of blown and cast or kiln worked glass and some uncommon surface treatments. The greater part of this class will be spent in the studio working with glass directly. However, slide lectures, videos and an artist-centered look into physics and optics will supplement the, generally speaking, more intuitive approach of working with glass. Collaborative and innovative work will be encouraged as will investigations into the innate properties of glass.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $200.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of department head or instructor required &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAPPING THE INTELLIGENCE OF YOUR WORK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar is for graduate students who are preparing their written thesis. Within the context of this writing-intensive course, we examine the thesis form as an expressive opportunity to negotiate a meaningful integration of our visual work, how we think about it, and how we wish to communicate it to others. In support of this exploration, weekly thematic writing sessions are offered to open the imaginative process and to stimulate creative thinking as a means of discovering the underlying intelligence of our work. In addition, we also engage in individual studio visits to identify and form a coherent 'voice' for the thesis, one that parallels our actual art involvement. Literary communications generated out of artists' process are also examined. The outcome of this intensive study is the completion of a draft of the thesis.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graduate level only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART &amp; DESIGN: INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION IN THEORY AND PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the Modernist ideal of individuated autonomy within each medium continues to play a determining role in art and design, even the most independently produced artworks involve degrees of collaboration, discussion, and shared processing, whether along the vertical axis of historical predecessors and influences or along the horizontal axis of collaboration and connection with fellow artists, designers, and fabricators. Through this course we will chart the relations between the artist-designer and society and consider the economic and ethico-political valences of collaboration. We will read from a variety of texts on subjects such as relational aesthetics, performativity, labor theory, site specificity, public art, collectivity. We'll also question whether the increasing visibility of collaboration has any critical purchase on questions of authorship, property, and value.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  This course is organized around a series of case studies in collaborative art/design practices that focus on two or three artists, projects, or works per session; two visits to New York to meet with artists and visit exhibitions; and in-class production sessions on collaborative projects. There are also short excursions around Providence to visit local artists and projects.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Funded by Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation and open to all graduate students in all disciplines, this professional practices course explores models, philosophies, strategies, and adaptive skills crucial to developing and communicating self-aware, diverse, sustainable, and evolving practices in art and design. The course is arranged in thematic parts - Work, Money, and Love. Work explores labor, manufacturing/fabrication, studio space and work environments, and diversified practice. Money tackles legal and financial literacy, markets, grants, and fundraising. And Love invites students into writing as discovery, collaboration, ethics, and engagement. We will act as a research group on professional issues in art and design - to, as Charles Eames once put it, "arrive at as well as convey insight." The goal is to experiment in shared, flexible forms of pedagogy in which we support one another in thinking critically and expansively about the work we want to do, the ideas we want to cultivate, and the lives we choose to live. In addition to the faculty of the course, visiting artists, designers, and other practitioners provide presentations, workshops, activities, and assignments over sustained meetings to broaden and deepen levels of inquiry, discovery, dialogue, and exchange-based experience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ORIGIN POINT: GRADUATE THESIS IDEATION WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The purpose of this seminar is to unearth a direction - an origin point - for your graduate thesis and to jump-start the writing process for the Master's written document. Organized as a series of writing intensive workshops, this forum will enable you to explore relevant ideas, themes, core values, and to conduct research in support of the inquiry process. The process involves seeking out and scrutinizing various angles of your perspective as an artist / designer. You will write from these angles to discover the emerging aspects of solutions that matter. Each class will suggest a specific theme or principle of inflection to precipitate what is needed for the work's progress. Included will be several forms of writing: profile, review, narrative essay, poem, report, extended caption, as well as several levels of research: journal and book reading, archival and fieldwork, and conversations and interviews. Emphasis will also be on maps of meaning that will be used as a way to further processes of ideation and understanding. At the conclusion of the seminar you will have a conceptual focus for your thesis that is clearly formulated visually and verbally. With this is place, the summer months can then be used productively to further the breadth and depth of this initial idea through open-ended exploration and self-generated work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Available to first-year graduate students&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: A GUIDED DRAWING SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media yet drawing can be independent of all other media. Can we make our drawing ventures have resonance? The goal is to understand drawing in a multivalent way through paced experiences and investigations via short research projects, three generative series and development of a sited-drawing plan. Methods will include teamed technical presentations of expertise or interest as well as examples of ancient and historical means of silverpoint, transfer drawings, panoramas and dioramas. Drawing epochs represented in the RISD Museum of Art, collection will be examined (through works by artists such as Wilfredo Lam, Gego, or the Rimpa period Korin Gafu.) Focused critiques, readings and guided and self-directed independent studio production are components. This seminar could be paired with the grad course Object Lessons.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as a requirement for MA, ARTE 658G.

   <COURSEDESC>Using RISD as a site for the exploration of strategies for studio-based teaching and learning is the goal of the course. It is designed for students who will be teaching during the course of study at RISD or who plan to teach after graduation. The course draws upon the varying expertise and teaching methodologies of RISD faculty and visiting faculty from other institutions to provide graduate students with models of practice. Learning to teach in a generative and attentive manner can bring teaching closer to one's studio practice. The course is composed of readings, reviews, discussion, project assignments, lectures, and peer presentations. The final outcome will be formation of a condensed teaching portfolio including a teaching philosophy, course proposals, a detailed syllabus, sample class assignments and assessment guides.&lt;br&gt; This course may also be taken in any sequence with Collegiate Teaching: Preparation + Reflection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as ARTE 055G.

   <COURSETITLE>ETHICS OF HUMANITARIAN DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Designers and artists have become central to projects of humanitarian intervention in different parts of the world.  From designing refugee camps and village schools to water filtration systems and weaving patterns that could compete in Western markets, they are not only making physical objects for disenfranchised across the world, but also shaping how we understand the problems at hand as well as the people in need.  This extended role demands a new ethical sensibility and historical knowledge in addition to technical know-how and aesthetic capability.  What does it mean to act ethically in a global context?  What is the nature of responsibility?  How do we communicate across difference without turning whom we seek to help into convenient caricatures of helpless poor?  Can art and design only provide stopgap solutions, leaving larger political and policy discussions for other disciplines?  Or can they address questions beyond the object and change our understanding of the problem itself?  &lt;BR&gt; This course will ask these hard questions and unpack them with the help of rigorous theoretical thinking and historical study.  This is not a "how-to" course.  Nor will we use ready-made definitions of ethics to endorse convenient and familiar ways of working.  This is a course about thinking.  We will slowly shape an understanding of ethics as a way of introducing reflective friction in our modes of operation and learn to criticize what we must simultaneously use.  Course material will include mind-opening historical and theoretical texts, uncomfortable fiction, and fraught films.  Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making, and vice versa, invited.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL ISSUES IN CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar draws on a number of critical texts from the past three decades by writers such as Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, bell hooks, Dave Hickey, and Arthur C. Danto while probing their linkages to key debates in contemporary culture. By considering issues that relate to the viability of the expression of the artist025s subjectivity in the post-modern era as well topics pertaining to race, gender, sexuality, the marketplace, mass media and popular culture, a broad view of the subjects, themes and discourses of contemporary art emerges. The course is structured around in-class discussion of assigned articles, slide lectures, and presentations. The seminar aims to extend the range of critical texts currently read by each student especially as they develop their graduate thesis. Each student is responsible for one 30-minute class presentation with a follow-up paper of 10-12 pages due the last day of class, or before. Participation in class discussion is a requirement of the course, constituting a part of the final grade.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ART AND DESIGN DEVELOPMENT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Art and Design for Development graduate seminar is for students interested in exploring the role art and design can play in addressing social justice issues in vulnerable, under-resourced and often still-developing regions of the world.  The seminar positions the artist/designer as an innovator and activist and explores methodologies and rationale for applying strategic design thinking, processes, and outcomes to issues as complex and diverse as persistent poverty; displaced communities, human and environmental devastation due to war; human trafficking and enslavement; resource deprivation, lack of educational opportunity; livelihood needs, etc.  Strategic planning and action, systems thinking, participatory methods, resilience theory, and capacity building provide the theoretical underpinnings for the course and are discussed within a critical framework of the history of international development and ethics of engagement.  Critical to this effort will be the students' development of rigorous research skills and clear methodological approaches, and their ability to map and critique their own progress through a strategic design thinking process.   The seminar is project based, and situates this effort within an overview and critique of the methodologies and scales of engagement represented by contemporary social impact focused design practice.  Projects are undertaken by interdisciplinary teams and focus on the design of strategic action plans for communities and/or organizations currently partnering with RISD's DESINE-Lab-an interdisciplinary applied research group focused on employing design, innovation, and entrepreneurship to address social and environmental justice issues and drive community-based social and economic development.  As key players in these on-going relationships, class participants have opportunities to stay involved with DESINE-Lab activities, help implement the steps of the various plans through interning with partnering organizations, lead workshops in the field, and collaborate with future design-build efforts.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class explores the ways that objects and bodies come into contact with one another, asking how objects adorn, articulate, equip, augment, and constitute the person.  Our exploration follows three tracks: we examine artifacts from the fields of design, fashion and medical engineering, as well as experimental propositions from the visual and conceptual arts, literature and film; we pair these case studies with scholarship that critically engages issues of embodiment and material agency; and we attend to the political and ethical debates raised by dynamic conceptions of posthuman bodies.  Interdisciplinary readings across the humanities and social sciences include: Appadurai, Freud, Haraway, Hayles, Heidegger, Latour, Marx, Miller, and Scary.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL ART ISSUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is "global art?":  Artists' perspectives and interpretations&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  Artists have, for centuries, worked across languages, disciplines, and lands to create work, artifacts, and collaborative projects that respond to specific contexts, geographies, and cultures.  Yet, over the past decade we hear increasingly from curators, critics, and art historians about the so-called "global turn" in the art world.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;BR&gt; This course works with art and design students at RISD, as well as visiting guests, to explore, from the artists's perspective and voice, what global art is, what it means, and whether it is a useful or relevant term for practicing artists today.  To guide the discussion, we explore the genealogy of the terms "global," "global art," "global art world," while also inviting in artists, critics, and curators to create a dialogue around this contested field.&lt;BR&gt; In addition, we look at how the concepts relating to "global art" have been developed and explored through art historical texts, art criticism, exhibitions and related catalogues, as well as larger art world events such as biennales and art fairs.  And we review how such terms and trends relate to the way in which artists are educated in a global context.&lt;BR&gt; Students are asked to participate in discussions as a class and with visiting guests, to regularly respond to readings, and to present a final paper that presents their perspective on this large topic.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST AND THE MUSEUM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will consider the various ways in which manifold artists from Marcel Duchamp through Joseph Cornell, Claes Oldenburg, Andy Warhol, Louise Lawler, Fred Wilson, Mark Dion and the Atlas Group have made aspects of the museum a subject matter of their work.  Alternatively engaged in a critique of museum practice or romantic evocations of the past, many artists for the past seventy years have addressed the staging devices that museums utilize to confer aura on the work of art as well as the makeup of their collections, categorization and behind the scenes storerooms and archives.   This history will be linked to an expanding body of writing that has emerged in the past three decades given to the differing discursive narratives that museums and their archives employ.  Writers such as Sigmund Freud, Theodor W. Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida, Rosalind Krauss, Douglas Crimp, Ralph Rugoff, and Susan Stewart. will be considered.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GROUP CRITICAL / CRITICAL DIALOGUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will serve as a forum for extended group critiques of the ongoing and self-initiated projects of its participants.  While different disciplines have differing formats for critique, the practice of critique in this class will not be taken for granted.  In general it will mean open-ended, generous, and rigorous analysis exchanged between peers. Through group critiques students will develop critical skills that will help them articulate the conceptual and formal premises of their work.  In addition, the course will speculate on critique as a form, examining what it might mean and how it can be used from a variety of perspectives that will chart out a recent history of intellectual thought on the subject.  The goal of this course, regardless of discipline, is to develop a cogent and critical understanding of your work that aid you in the elaboration and illumination of your practice and push the development of you ongoing practice. &lt;BR&gt;  The seminar portion of the class will include examinations of artists, designers and architects tailored to fit each student's interests and related readings by: Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Bertolt Brecht, Judith Butler, Michel DeCerteau, Paul DeMan, Ricardo Dominguez, Umberto Eco, Paolo Friere, Michel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, Elizabeth Grosz, Stuart Hall, N. Katherine Hayles, Friedrich Nietzsche, Oscar Wilde, and Raymond Williams, among others.&lt;BR&gt;  Note: This hybrid seminar/studio course is scheduled for 5 hours. There will be some days when class may meet for 3 or 4 hours.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TIME / TECHNICS / MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"I know very well what time is," writes Augustine in the Confessions, "until the moment you ask me, and then I do not know."  This philosophical candor was much admired by Ludwig Wittgenstein, who advised that what we cannot speak of we must therefore remain silent.  Time, in itself imperceptible, is rendered salient through a variety of intercessionary technologies, utilizing sand, shadow, water, or more complex kinetic devices, to make visible, or audible, its 'passage.'  Time can be measured through the body in any number of ways: the physical aging of our bodies, our kinetic movements, the performance of our everyday actions, and our changing outward personal style or disposition.  Aesthetic forms, scientific and literary productions 'unfold' in time, moving toward an inexorable conclusion, end, closure or renewal.  Phenomena persist, endure, and dissipate. In our contemporaneity time-based media are ubiquitous, and the intimacy between, for example, a naturally produced utterance and its technical reproducibility has become coextensive.&lt;br&gt; In this seminar we will begin with an inquiry into the nature of time, beginning with the pre-Socratics, carrying through to Kant, Heidegger, Agamben and Stiegler; at the same time we will also examine the notion of 'technical-being' or techn, contrasted with biological, living being, bios, zon.  But the primary orientation of this seminar will address the medial or technical and aesthetic register of time-based processes and devices.  From the camera obscura to telephony, from the incunabula of the proto-cinema to current digital globalizations, we will explore both the materialities and the theories of time, technics and media, and the complexities they entail. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ISSUES IN CURATORIAL PRACTICE: ARTIST AS CURATOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar examines the dynamic environment of international curatorial work. Using a case study approach that focuses on particular projects, exhibitions and venues, the course explores contemporary curatorial strategies and innovations sited in museums, galleries, and the public realm, as well as artists and designers who use curatorial concepts in their practice. In particular, this course will explore historic and contemporary instances of artist curated exhibitions. Through critical discussions, conversations with curators and artists, and site visits, we explore how curatorial work responds to and shapes power structures in art, design, and material culture and how ideas of audience, engagement, participation and interactivity influence the critical environment for contemporary artists and designers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; Graduate elective&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL EXCHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, an art history of exchange projects from the past forty years informs individual and collective projects that involve critical exchange.  From Franz Erhard Walther's First Work Set (1963-69) to Ben Kinmont's I Need You (1992), from Jose Antonio Vega Macotela's Time Divisa (2006-2010) to Carey Young's Mutual Release (2008), this course understands the reciprocal labor, production, and distribution in artworks as integral to the meaning of the work.  Readings from economic sociology as well as contemporary art criticism are paired with contemporary art works and practices to build a framework for the development of critical exchange projects.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; During the 2014 Fall semester this course is taught online on 10/2, 10/9, 10/23, 11/6 &amp; 11/13; Course meets in New York City on 9/20, 9/21, 11/22 &amp; 11/23 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WRITING+</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Are you fascinated by the vast and profound public/private thinking and communication apparatus called writing?  Are you struck by the warp speed with which writing culture is changing and impatient to see what's next?  Do you want to engage practically, intellectually, and collectively with the possibilities?  If so, here's a course for you. Writing+ engages with the current moment in writing-when every link in the print world supply chain between writer and reader has dissolved or transformed; looks at key transitional moments of writing culture in the past-from oral to written, from manuscript to print, from the announcement of a new century to articulation of its identity; and asks students to imagine and make models of what writing will be in the mid-21st century. &lt;BR&gt;   In 2011, Microsoft commissioned a design project called The Future of Writing from the Royal College of Art in London. Five small teams of design alumni "took a speculative approach to looking at the way authorship may change in the future."  We can start by critiquing the results.  But our project will be specific to 2014, RISD culture and resources, the commitments of our particular team(s)-and how far we can lean from there. &lt;BR&gt;   The course, which is funded by RISD 2050, will be supported by a visiting speaker series which students will organize, host, and moderate. Toward the end of the semester, students will co-curate and manage an exhibition of their ideas/models, engaging in public dialog.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective seminar &lt;br&gt;  Undergraduates can Register by permission of instructor only &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>STUDIO LANGUAGES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In Imaginary Homelands, the Indian British author Salman Rushdie writes, "The word 'translation' comes, etymologically, from the Latin for 'bearing across.'  Having been borne across the world, we are translated [people].  It is normally supposed that something always gets lost in translation; I cling obstinately to the notion that something can also be gained." &lt;BR&gt;  What does our work in art and design gain from acts of translation?  How does a creative practice rooted in multilingual experience navigate linguistic and cultural hybridity?  How does material and conceptual contact between languages shape one's work or provide a foundation for asking large questions? &lt;BR&gt; This combination studio/seminar course explores the relationship between art and language on multiple scales.  We will collectively examine, through in-class discussions, lectures, readings and critique of studio assignments, how our relationships to language make possible an aesthetics of communication, a space where visual and verbal intersections speak of interactions between cultures.  Lectures will present the work of artists who use text, translation, voice, and language learning as strategies to parlay their sociolinguistic perceptions into agency.  Critique of student work produced in response to assignments will focus on an exploration of language within and around each student's art practice.  This course is recommended for those who speak more than one language or are interested in multiple Englishes and intercultural communication as material, subject and foundation for creative excavation. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXPERIMENTAL PUBLISHING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>More and more, artists and designers work publicly and performatively. To create and broadcast to a particular audience is an empowering act, and while it's never been easier to self-publish, the options are overwhelming. What role can self-publishing play in an artist's own practice? What technologies, platforms and media are available for disseminating our self-authored texts, ideas and products?   &lt;BR&gt; Experimental Publishing Studio is an elective studio that explores the artist's individual capacity for publishing his or her own work. In this "performing publishing" studio we'll define a territory that includes print-on-demand, browser-based CMS, collaborative doc sharing, social media, one-on-one encounters, web-to-print and other concepts that expand the field of independent publishing. We'll trace a deep trajectory that includes Alexander Pope's 1713 crowd-sourced translation of the Iliad to Duchamp's boxes to "democratic multiple" zine culture to Tumblr and New Hive and beyond. We'll look at the explosion of print and indie publishing as it manifests at Printed Matter's art book fairs to Metahaven's call for designers to create and publish actively and politically.   &lt;BR&gt; Most importantly, we'll explore the idea of an "ambient practice" and investigate ideas for pushing our work across multiple platforms and media. &lt;BR&gt;   The semester will be devoted to the creation of fully-developed publishing projects. Working in public, research-based exploration, experimentation and collaboration will be encouraged. &lt;BR&gt;   Familiarity with Adobe Creative Suite is helpful but not a requirement.  &lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This series of workshops explores the theoretical and practical aspects of curating exhibitions and the changing roles of the curator with regard to artists, the art-object, and institutions. Here are some questions to prompt us: How can we characterize curatorial 'authorship' in the age of the professional curator? What are some of the positions curators take in mediating objects for viewers? What does curatorial 'transgression' look like?   &lt;BR&gt; Through concentrated readings, discussions, and curatorial focus-projects, we will cover contemporary thinking on exhibitions and curatorial practices. These practices can include everything from the traditional thematic 'show,' to multi-platform and event-based exhibitions, online exhibitions, experimental publications, pedagogical interventions, and artist-organized spaces. The workshops aim to get students thinking creatively and critically about the transition of a work from production to display or distribution-studio-to-exhibition, rehearsal-to-performance, private-to-public-and the various potentialities that arise from that movement. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Graduate elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

He resisted what he described as education "funnels" advocating instead for educational "webs" that combine learning, collaboration, and technology to achieve more vibrant pedagogical models for "de-institutionalized" society. &lt;BR&gt;   Two years later, he wrote Tools for Conviviality where he challenges specialized knowledge, hierarchical structures, and the counterproductivity of industrialized society.  In contrast to the monopolization of professional technocrats, Illich proposed to "invert the present deep structure of tools" and to give people "tools that guarantee their right to work with independent efficiency."  For Illich, the concept of conviviality summons levels of interdependence and creativity to embrace that tools have many applications - often in contrast to their intended use - that become expressions of the user, artist, or designer. &lt;BR&gt;  The Conviviality of Tools provides an open framework ready to incorporate any type of production, creation, or distribution activity, from coding to visualization; sound, image and text; and material fabrications from small to modular to large to serial.  It is an intelligent practical and critical introductory strategy specifically for graduate students interested in working across domains, collaboratively, and open-mindedly based on both resonances and differences of materials and processes.  It is a support structure for research-based making and inquiry.  &lt;BR&gt; The Conviviality of Tools explores and activates RISD Co-Works' eclectic range of equipment, technology, and tools often utilizing Hacker space approaches and hybrid activities to connect adaptive processes and tools to broad and sustained creative structures of a thesis body of work and research.

   <COURSETITLE>WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS: UNCOVERING THE MECHANICS OF COLLABORATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In a world where complex problems demand working well with others, what makes for successful collaboration?  &lt;BR&gt; To uncover the mechanics of collaboration this 3 credit course introduces current theories of knowledge negotiation, explores interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary techniques, and gathers the insights of select RISD faculty participating in ongoing art+design+science collaborations.   &lt;BR&gt; Works Well with Others is structured as a collaboration between participating students and faculty. Working together, we will formulate the research agenda that will guide the semester, share our efforts to understand what works and develop models of collaborative structures.   &lt;BR&gt; The course will be of special interest to students interested in effective collaboration with experts across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEAM); using art &amp; design to enhance scientific learning (and vice versa); combining science in their art and design practices; and laying a conceptual and practical foundation for future professional opportunities that require interdisciplinary skills.  &lt;BR&gt; Works Well with Others is open to graduate and undergraduate students (as IDISC-1532-01) across the College.  The course is supported by the Rhode Island Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a National Science Foundation initiative.  Interested students should contact Charlie Cannon (ccannon@risd.edu) or Chris Rose (crose@risd.edu) directly.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN STUDIO I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Design is an ever-expanding field that demands students be accustomed to constant change and requires the development of confidence and core competencies for life-long practice. In this two-year studio track, students will learn to identify design opportunities and areas of inquiry within question-based units framed by the faculty team. &lt;BR&gt;  Each unit will vary in length, and will begin with a particular question to kick-off the process. For each unit, students will move through research, analysis, ideation, and prototyping and will be asked to communicate their findings. Units will increase in complexity over the four semesters, and are sequenced to move from a guided process to more open, self-generated methodologies. Units will be inquiry-based, allowing for a wide variety of outcomes to open questions. &lt;BR&gt;  By the end of the second year, each student should be in tune with his or her own working methods and will have the ability to frame projects independently and with self determination. Inherent in the course format is a kind of elasticity and nimbleness that should allow for group projects, social &amp; cultural engagement, and formal investigations instigated through a variety of faculty-posed questions. &lt;BR&gt;  Some examples of the questions (prompts) students receive might be: What is graphic? or How are tools shaped by contemporary culture, technology, and convention? or How is a spatial or dimensional experience plotted and communicated?  or How can you prevent people from texting while driving? These questions will be accompanied by a mix of precedents, theoretical contexts, readings and presentations, technical and/or formal exercises and working methods. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Requirement, Sophomore Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department;course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPOGRAPHY FOR NONMAJORS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This introductory course is intended for non-majors interested in learning the basic principles of typography including the study of letterforms, type classification, legibility, organization and hierarchy, as well as text applications, grid systems and page layout. Typography will be explored as both a means of communication and a vehicle for expression. Projects may include comparative studies for setting text and poetry, letterhead systems, brochure or poster. This course will provide a solid foundation for moving on to more complex typographic problems such as book, motion or web design.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;    </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TYPE &amp; IMAGE IN MOTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We stand firmly planted in a visual world, surrounded by a universe of things to look at. Images flicker from televisions, iPads, computer monitors and more-as large as towering billboards and as small as compact cell phones. Such images provide us with clues about our environment, feeding our mind with information that we find useful for survival or for orientation purposes. But these very same images clutter the horizon and prevent us from discerning what is truly important. How do we tell them apart? The primary goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to create meaningful and intelligent images. Course content is tailored for three levels of experience - introductory, intermediate and advanced. Some of the class projects include documentary photography, film title design and music video. The works of Saul Bass, Bill Viola and Michel Gondry will be used as the "textbooks" for this course. Readings, film screenings and listening exercises accompany studio work. Some knowledge of Adobe Flash or After Effects or Final Cut Pro would be helpful but is not required.

   <COURSEDESC>With emphasis on open search and experimentation this course explores how we experience the visible word. We will consider how typographic form can serve that purpose to read, frame, engage and inspire the depth and breadth of meaning. After brief introductory assignments to establish common ground, the course format becomes an open laboratory for individual (or collaborative) interests and inquiries. Participants are encouraged to experiment with the visible word such as to explore: the de/reconstruction of texts; type in 3-d space, or in motion, or in digital media; words and the sensory experience of materiality, sound, projection; text as poetry in public environments; visual and concrete poetry. Topics for inquiry can range from the practical to the poetical, to the purely experimental. Course work can supplement other course interests (especially graduate thesis work and degree projects).&lt;br&gt;With permission of instructor required it is necessary to receive the approval in writing from the instructor at a week before registration via email: tockerse@risd.edu (it will help to communicate your course interest, and even a project interest)&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Open to junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department.  Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>OPEN RE/SEARCH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course offers individuals the opportunity to pursue a project or topic of personal  interest related to visual design and communication. This may be an interest or activity not offered in other courses, a personal ideal, a unique circumstance, a collaboration of two or more individuals, the preliminary work for the Degree Project, or to supplement Graduate Thesis work, etc. The work can involve a broad range of curiosities like sustainability, sociocultural activism, public service, criticism, spirituality; the nature of theory; practice and experiment; methodology; technology; interactivity. While similar to an ISP or CSP this course differs in its objectives to also offer a dynamic learning experience: 1) to meet as a class (and in small groups and privately) to facilitate interaction and share work and ideas; 2) to discuss topics of interest and relevance to the group; 3) to stimulate interdisciplinary and inter-level interaction among students (all levels and non-majors are welcome!). Note: the scheduled time slot is not fixed, and we can accommodate schedule preferences or conflicts with other courses of student interest. With permission of instructor required it is necessary to receive the approval in writing from the instructor at a week before registration, after submitting a project proposal via email: hnurosi@risd.edu (project proposals must include: title, project synopsis, personal value of this project and interest, and a general projection of tasks involved).&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BRAND IDENTITY DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Branding-or the development of an identity and an identity system-is a critical skill practiced by today's designers. Before we can design a brochure or a web site or an interface, there must be an identity to frame and influence the medium. Branding as a discipline not only requires the ability to design logos, but to think strategically about a company's ethos and mission. Having thought strategically about ethos or mission not only positions a designer to create an identity and identity system but to influence the way a company or organization conducts all of its communications.&lt;BR&gt; In this course, students will create two identity systems: one for a traditional company and one for a socially constructive campaign. While a traditional identity system is defined as a logo and a set of rules for that logo's application, the goal of this class is to expand upon the ways a brand identity can be expressed through the manipulation of language, materials, and audience expectation/participation.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only.&lt;br&gt; Open to junior, senior, and graduate.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO ELECTIVE I</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course combines viral media and speculative design. Students will create web experiences that imagine hypothetical futures and cultural "what if" scenarios. We'll address design as a way to inspire reflection and discussion about pressing societal questions: In what ways could our culture improve? What injustices are we not confronting or preparing for? Where are our blind spots as we move forward? What utopias and dystopias might we summon? Students in the course will create viral webmedia projects that render such questions visible to pop culture. By approaching speculative design in web-native terms, designers can leverage network effects and stimulate widespread discussion of cultural concerns.&lt;br&gt;  Supporting materials and classroom conversations will draw on many topics: critical design, viral marketing, startup culture, tactical media, science fiction, post-internet notions of web &amp; image, athletic aesthetics, and beyond. Students may work individually or in small groups. The course has no formal pre-requisites, but background with web design (HTML, CSS, Javascript) will be very helpful.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE STUDIO II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This studio course is based on the premise that the narrative shaping of information is fundamental to human communication. As active participants in cultural production, graphic designers naturally collaborate within varied areas of expertise, assuming a documentary role in how society views itself. Narrative methods enable us to speak to (and through) any content with a sense of the story it has to tell - visually representing historical, curatorial, scientific, and abstract ideas and events. Students will explore design as a process of storytelling that includes linear and non-linear relationships, with an emphasis on developing formal strategies for multiple approaches to shaping a narrative experience from given as well as self-generated content. Particular emphasis is on sequence, framing, cause and effect, the relationships between elements, and the synthesis of parts into wholes. With text and image, and across media, we employ narrative methods to make sense of complex content meant to be shared and understood.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The visualizing of information into graphic form is one of the oldest forms of graphic design, and is one of the essential areas of professional design engagement. This course deals with the organization and analyzation of data, and the concepts and methods of visualizing information. Using information structure and visual systems of form, color, and typography, students will work projects which communicate complex information through the use of maps, graphs, charts, and diagrams. These projects will explore issues of mapping, hierarchy, location, time, comparison, motion, format, and the use of symbolic visual language.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Junior and Above&lt;BR&gt; Graphic Design majors only&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE THESIS II</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a continuation of the work begun in fall semester's Graduate Thesis I (GRAPH 327G). The 6-credit studio component is complemented with a 3-credit thesis writing seminar, together guiding the synthesis of independent visual and verbal investigations into a coherent thesis body of work. The MFA degree requires completion of a graduate thesis. The thesis, as a major undertaking for advanced study and personal development, also assists the student to direct a program of study for an experience that best serves that individual's interests and needs. The thesis is an inquiry into the process, expression and function of the visual in graphic design. Visual search is the primary means by which to develop and substantiate original work which provides proof of concept for the thesis argument, critique, or point of view. The graduate student is encouraged to go beyond established models and to project his/her unique character in the thesis rather than to evidence vocational training, which is implicit. The productions can involve any medium suitable to need and content. Ultimately the thesis is submitted as a written document supported by a body of visual work that is a meaningful synthesis of the visual and verbal, and a lasting contribution to the field of graphic design. Two copies of the document remain, one for the Library and one for the department. Completion is required before graduation as stipulated by the College.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; Graphic Design majors only. &lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This graduate-only Visiting Designers course provides contact with the visiting designers in four intensive workshops over the 12-week semester. The course objective is to provide graduates contact and interactions with national and international designers involved in a range of professional practice and public discourse of graphic design. While the emphasis is on typography and print, these designers actively explore a range of visual form. Each workshop will consider what provokes, inspires, and informs your working methods, and the role that "publication" plays in the communication of your ideas. Each session begins with a Thursday evening lecture, a Friday afternoon through Saturday workshop, and a Sunday midday critique.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate  Students Only. Graphic Design Majors Only or by special permission if space permits&lt;br&gt; Registration by Graphic Design department, course may be repeated for credit&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This is a hands-on studio class exploring the traditions and techniques of Asian paper and book arts. We begin with the basics, by cooking Japanese plant fibers (kozo, mitsumata and gampi), forming the beaten pulp into thin sheets of washi (paper). Students experiment with decorative paper techniques of suminagashi (marbled), itajime (clamped) and shibori (tie and dyed) papers. Printed images of your individual woodblock carved design will be incorporated into the final collaborative book project. Text material will develop from your own written haiku poetry. Non-western binding structures will be explored. Asian box making techniques will complete our investigation into the traditional book arts of the east.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;BR&gt; Open to junior, senior, graduate&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIGGER THAN YOURSELF: LARGE SCALE GRAPHIC INTERRUPTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As screens become a primary delivery method for information and visual form, graphic designers are confined to working in exceedingly smaller viewports. This course will refocus our attention to the physical environment as an opportunity for graphic interruption and large scale works. Students will investigate issues of modularity, duplication, architectural framing, placement, and interruption as potential for inserting graphic form into our collective environment, both physically and through the use of projection. Throughout the semester, we will reference poster design, supergraphics, exhibition signage, way finding systems, and art installations as disciplines in which graphic designers are producing work at dramatic scale.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Open to Senior, Graduate&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Particular attention will be paid to certain elements of design production, including the visual, tactile, and aesthetic qualities of paper, printing, binding, color separation, and advanced techniques in reproduction, namely duotone and three-tone in black and white photography. In the first part of the semester students will design the layout and the corresponding dust jacket for a photographic book. The material will include a number of original black and white photographs from one of the very well known French photographers. In the second part of the semester, students will be given the choice between designing a book based on their own interests and completing a book design project using assigned material.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>UNFOLDING + ENFOLDING MEANING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course we will inquire into the nature of understanding the design process from two perspectives: how do we process ideas to help us unpack meaning relative to complexity and vagueness; and how do we package meaning into a meaningful design interface for communication. Our ever-changing social and media-dependent environment increasingly demands that designers understand how to navigate this web of relations. Without that understanding, design is limited to empty form, senseless embellishment, and uninspired repetition. This course offers practical insight into the mechanisms of meaning for relational design via semiotics and mindful action. While semiotics is known as a logical system for critical thinking, more important for designers is its use as a tool to generate creative, original and optimal results. With this theoretical underpinning, the course emphasizes studio work to demonstrate the principles and value of semiotics. Moreover, while early studio work is assigned to establish common ground, ultimately participants apply this knowledge to individualized interests (open or degree projects, thesis work, etc.).&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Graph Design majors, Junior and above&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio course explores visual communication needs and design responsibility for human experiences in a changing social environment. The premise is that designed objects function in a vast range of possible relationships that pattern and shape identity, information, and behavior. We will address this design spectrum. The course emphasizes "making" via visual search and experimentation, but also embraces theory to describe complexity and envision change in design practice. Responding to the growing world paradigm of collaboration and integrative thinking we will experience group dynamics, consider how new media can serve social and information needs, explore ways to solve problems, and stimulate imagination and innovation.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Graphic Design majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by  Graphic Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MODES OF SELF PUBLISHING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Zines are typically self-published works with small circulations. Because of their spontaneity and low-fi craft, they allow individuals to express a broad range of voices in a rapidly shareable way; a device that has endured via sub-cultures that do not rely on power structures to function. Now, in a media landscape made more accessible through new technology, the definition of zines needs to be reassessed. What kind of forms and distribution strategies are possible via various modes such as printed matter, web, and mobile apps? What role does independent publishing play in a time when ideas are readily shared across moderated online platforms?  &lt;BR&gt;  We will explore 'zine', not just as a circulation platform for printed matter, but as an experimental vehicle for visual or verbal content. Through discussion and research, we will consider historical context and study a range of makers who use independent publishing as a medium. Bringing this into our own practice, we will learn how to visually express ideas that are openly distributed and can expand independent publication strategies in the context of contemporary media. You will create, curate, and circulate work whose meaning is amplified by its own process.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Designing for the internet requires a solution that embraces the web as a communication medium while providing for a unique user experience. The goal is to strike a balance between form and function, between visual design and effective communication. This course will cover the latest methods of web design, development, and production including standards-based XHTML, CSS, Javascript and media integration. From beginners to those with more experience, students will learn the most current techniques for planning, designing, building and testing a fully functional website start to finish.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Requirements: Students must be comfortable with Adobe Photoshop. Students must provide their own laptop (Mac or PC) loaded with Photoshop and an HTML editing program (Dreamweaver, BBEdit, GoLive, etc.).&lt;BR&gt; Section 1: Sophomore and Above &lt;br&gt; Section 2: Open to all&lt;br&gt;  Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHAPING LANGUAGE: A STUDIO COURSE ON THE MATERIALITY OF WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Writing is a flexible material and molds to multiple forms: as tweets, texts, code, and pixels; abstraction, sculpture, art and news; in 2D, 3D, books, and screen; for public, private, galleries, and commerce. While graphic designers have a deep kinship to the world of words, we are rarely tasked with making the words we shape.  What could writing look like if we were concerned with the whole expression, from writing to form, and vise versa? What if the boundaries between the two were no longer rigid or distinct and we treated writing as making, and making as writing.  &lt;br&gt; In this studio, we will explore what it means to shape language--we will write in multiple ways, and even re-define what 'writing' means as we frame and respond to project prompts. Through a series of short and long projects, students will investigate the power we have to expand the experience of words, both for ourselves as designers, form-makers and readers; as well as for our audiences. This studio establishes a space--a lab of sorts--for students who are writers, thinkers, wordsmiths, text or type enthusiasts. We will encourage and consider everything from the most intimate paper-based word/text explorations, to screen-based work, to language systems or code, to monumental and sculptural word experiments. As long as language is the medium, projects can be very open. &lt;br&gt; As we make our own work, we will also read and consider work by various wordsmiths, including but not limited to Kenneth Goldsmith, Anne Carson, Anne Hamilton, Ed Ruscha, Hito Steyerl, Xu Bing, Dieter Roth, Agnes Martin, Mira Schendel, to name just a few.  &lt;br&gt; The course will culminate in a publication that documents our explorations and experiments. Course open to graduate and undergraduate &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Graphic Design majors, Juniors and above; all others by permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIES, DAMN LIES, AND DATAVIZ</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Charts and graphs have an indisputable aura of objectivity and yet, much like statistics, they can use this power to either elucidate or mislead. What makes an information graphic 'trustworthy' and how do designers know that their work is telling the 'whole story'? In this course we will deal with the mechanics of collecting &amp; processing data from the local environment and the larger world. Eschewing the expected line graphs and pie charts, students will explore different ways of communicating the data's meaning in a quantitatively rigorous and visually engaging way. Projects will involve the use of scripting languages, web scraping, databases, and other numerical tools to transform data into something that is understood rather than simply 'seen'. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to Graphic Design majors only, Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate the unique challenges graphic designers face working across print and digital interfaces, and the opportunities for these spaces to have a dialogue with each other. Students will develop strategies for creating coherent visual and conceptual relationships that bridge this divide. How can responsiveness translate to print? What is the digital equivalent of a french-fold binding? Can a website be a time-capsule? Can a book be refreshed? &lt;BR&gt;   Students will be promoted to propose a project that makes use of a design methodology which can be explored through both the virtual and the physical, and consider how, or if, these spaces are different. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to Graphic Design majors only, Junior and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMPUTER UTOPIAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The goal of this studio is to reimagine the personal computer. &lt;BR&gt;  Three decades ago, the Macintosh dropped a sci-fi bomb on pop culture. It advertised a utopic vision of human-computer creativity to mass audiences. By remixing military-industrial-academic fragments, a product company sold the dream of new humanism. This decade, the planet is bursting with smartphones; billions of people will carry globally-networked pocket computers, each outfitted with sensors that datify the material world. We now have quantities, rates, and kinds of data unlike anything humankind has ever seen. Individual biological minds can't reason at network scale, so we're teaching fields of computers to do it instead.  &lt;BR&gt; If the data center is today's mainframe, is there a Macintosh hiding in the next decade? If your phone's camera is the next mouse, what will it click on? As machine learning reinvents humanism, what are 21st century creative tools? What do network literacy and 21st century citizenship look like? Is the programmer/user dichotomy destroyable? How much of this is just a design problem? &lt;BR&gt; We'll explore these topics with studio work and seminar-style discussion. Studio work will include creation of mockups, videos, webmedia, interaction design, and beyond. Prototypes and design fictions are welcome. Programming experience is not explicitly required. Sincere eagerness to rigorously engage and reorient computer culture is a must. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Junior and above &lt;br&gt; Graphic design majors only &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: ART &amp; RITUAL IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C503.

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF JERUSALEM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Jerusalem has earned a special eminence among the famed ancient cities of the world.  Its sanctity to Jews, Christians, and Moslems has made the city a focus of discussions and controversies regarding the evolving and changing identifies throughout its long urban history. Early and recent studies and discoveries, as well as old and new theories with a special emphasis on the Roman, Byzantine, and Early Islamic periods (ca. 63 BCE - 1099 CE) will be examined in the seminar.  A particular focus will be placed on how to identify ethnicity, religious identity, and gender in the archaeological record.  Though politics and religion have often biased related scholarship and the way excavations and their interpretations have been presented to the public, the goal of the seminar is to understand and examine various opinions and viewpoints.  This seminar will consist of regular meetings, with illustrated lectures, student presentations, and discussions. In addition to the presentations, weekly reading assignments, a mid-term exam, and a final term paper will be required.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HPSS C729.

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: GLOBAL-LOCAL CONTEMPORARY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What is globalism, and should we be celebrating it? Can we disentangle globalism from capitalism, and what is at stake in this effort? And what happens to the specificity of the local - the base of the political - in the internationalist flows of contemporary art? Examining notions of canon, legacy, influence, discourse, history, tradition, place and displacement, this seminar maps the current state of international contemporary art. It focuses on the recent artistic, scholarly, critical and curatorial attempts to rerout the linear trajectories of late modernism. Such initiatives all aim at conceiving an expanded - or even exploded - cartography of contemporary art. What might such a map look like? &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Does the approach to the conservation of ancient art differ from that of the conservation of contemporary art?  How and why do materials composing visual art deteriorate?  Which environmental factors adversely affect organic and inorganic materials first or fastest?  In this course, the student will gain an understanding for the five agents of deterioration, for issues of physical and chemical stability regarding organic and inorganic materials chosen by artists over the millennia, as well as how the care and handling of art differs in some respects for a museum than for a working artist.   Frequent visits through the museum exhibits, storage, and the conservation lab will demonstrate key concepts covered in the class.  Ethical issues regarding the determination of the original intent of any given artist as well as ethical issues regarding forgeries and looted art will be discussed.  Assignments will focus on the RISD Art Museum's collection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Restricted to HAVC concentrators or MA candidates in Museum Education&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Interdisciplinary by their very nature, textile traditions share a global history. Around the world textiles have found place in cultures as signifiers of social identity, from the utilitarian to the sacred, as objects of ritual meaning and as objects of great tangible wealth. The evolution of textile motifs, designs, materials and technology across Asia, Africa and the Americas will be explored utilizing the RISD Museum of Art with frequent visits to the textile and costume collections. We will examine such topics as: the function of textiles in the survival of traditional cultures, the impact of historic trade routes and ensuing colonialism, industrialization and its subsequent effect on traditional techniques of textile manufacture. Students will also have opportunity to examine various methods of textile display, analysis and storage appropriate to items of cultural heritage via case studies of specific objects in the RISD Museum.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTIST'S TALK: KENTRIDGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course analyzes the most commanding artists' lecture-performances of our time, focusing on the rhetorical strategies and performative gambits that contemporary artists muster in service of their public image.  It is also a practical course in rhetoric, or how to give an artist's talk. In the first few classes we analyze some of the classic modernist debates around self-representation- the quandaries of talking a little or talking a lot, for example - and explore high modernist texts as Matisse's Notes of A Painter and Picasso's 1933 self-curated retrospective. The class considers a range of landmark lectures, from those of Ben Shahn to John Cage, Robert Morris and Frank Stella. The last section of the course addresses William Kentridge's lecture-performances in tandem with developing individual student's rhetorical skills, both through presentations of other artist's work and their own. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL VOCABULARY OF CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class provides an introduction to contemporary art theory and its philosophical underpinnings.  Through critical readings in philosophy, literary theory, psychoanalysis, and art history, this course aims to familiarize students with the occasionally obscure, and sometimes blustery language of contemporary art.  Each class we approach a single term: such as "fetish," "neo-avant-garde" or "relational aesthetics;" or analyze dialogic pairings like "author/authority" or "origin/originality."  We examine the historical trajectories and philosophical underpinnings of these terms, charting their shifting and at times contradictory meanings. We also discuss some of the key texts of contemporary art in which these critical terms appear, and finally we consider what is at stake in the use of this critical vocabulary.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: HANDS, INSTRUMENTS, MATERIALS AND MINDS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are we made by things that we make? How do things precede their creation and make the creator, before the brush touches the canvas, the pencil the paper, the pen the ?mayline,? the fingertips the keyboard, the eye the camera, the metal the mold, the glass the fire? This course will look at the emergence of specific instruments of art and design making from medieval parchment folios, to graphite pencil, to architectural parallel straightedge, to mechanical and then electronic scanners, CAD software and 3D printers. It would follow the conceit that the process of creation we set for production of things also organizes our sense of self and the world, even before we have produced those things, just by virtue of the goals we have set for them, the processes we have organized for their production, the tools we have gathered or invented to transform them. We will explore the argument that physical things are always already ?epistemic? things as well: organizers of knowledge and meaning; knowledge that bubbles in the cauldron of meaning under which we are continuously trying to set the flame of experiment and process in to produce our historical, social, political, cultural and personal identities. Reading will cover a wide range of topics and disciplinary areas: from historians of science looking at production of immortal cell-lines, GMO seeds and combative viruses, to artists  and designers discussing production of stone carving tools and images produced by spitting blood on rocks, to art-historians talking about breeding horses to produce that ultimate paintbrush. Only serious thinkers hopelessly invested in their making (and vice versa) invited. Class attendance and participation is mandatory along with a final presentation and research paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar will examine a series of canonical readings of contemporary art, focusing primarily on key writings published in the journal October and the magazine Artforum since 1975. We will engage in detail with such overarching critical concepts as postmodernism, neo-avant-garde, site-specificity, and relational aesthetics. We will also examine readings that draw on concepts such as the fetish, the abject, the informe, the gaze, primitivism, and postcolonialism. Finally, we will attend to issues of writerly style and method, seeking to understand the wide variety of tools that critics and art historians employ to understand, historicize, and enrich our understanding of works of contemporary art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as PAINT 4516 for junior painting majors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will engage in detail with such overarching critical concepts as postmodernism, neo-avant-garde, site-specificity, and relational aesthetics. We will also examine readings that draw on concepts such as the fetish, the abject, the informe, the gaze, primitivism, and postcolonialism. Finally, we will attend to issues of writerly style and method, seeking to understand the wide variety of tools that critics and art historians employ to understand, historicize, and enrich our understanding of works of contemporary art.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as PAINT 4516 for junior painting majors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTLES &amp; MONASTERIES: ROMANESQUE ART AND ARCHITECTURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>People in Western Europe changed both the way they lived and the way they conceived and made visual culture during the 11th and 12th centuries.  It was the time of castles and pilgrimages, women mystics, and liturgical drama.  The rich, diverse, and inventive art produced in Western Europe during this period includes pilgrimage churches with complex sculpted facades, illuminated manuscripts, castles, isolated monasteries, narrative textiles, and Islamic pottery.  This course will address the relationship between visual culture and other phenomena of the age and will require the completion of assigned readings, a research paper, and two examinations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTS &amp; CRAFTS MOVEMENT IN AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Beginning in the 1870s, an international movement to reform the design of architecture and interior furnishings took hold in America.  Its proponents were on a mission to improve the aesthetics of daily life, and they waged a moral crusade that advocated the pride and honesty of hand craftsmanship and embraced the ideal of unity of design. This course addresses reform ideals in the architecture, graphics, furniture, silver, ceramics, and related interior furnishings of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement in America from 1875 -1920. The importance of experiencing and interpreting objects in context is emphasized through artifact study in the collections of the John Hay Library, the RISD Museum, and the Providence Art Club.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHANTOMS OF BEAUTY: ART AND POLITICS IN MODERN ITALIAN FILM MASTERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course studies Italian visual culture and politics - issues of landscape, architecture, painting, history, and fashion - in some major Italian filmmakers who have been labeled with art historical and aesthetic terms:'ealist' Rossellini, 'baroque' Fellini, 'modernist' Antonioni, 'mannerist' or 'avant-garde' Pasolini, 'theatrical' Visconti, 'spectacular' Bertolucci, and 'essayist' Moretti.  Like 'phantoms of beauty' (a term used by the Italian film critic Guido Fink), images, aesthetic issues and styles from art history, politics and media have consciously inspired or deeply haunted the works of these authors. Film critics have analyzed their idiosyncratic and avant-garde fusion of aesthetics and politics in debates which have established their ongoing international status of 'masters of the art film' from the 1940's to the 1990's and beyond. We will study some of these films as constructions of the modern Italian identity and visual culture for a national and international audience.  Requirements: Weekly group discussions on readings, one final paper.</COURSEDESC>

General themes will be perspective, form, color, and mechanical devices, and will include discussions on intellectual training, notebooks, treatises, and collecting. The course will examine artists such as Masaccio, Leonardo, Piero della Francesca, D|rer, Serlio, Carlo Urbino, Cigoli, Rubens, Vel`zquez, Saenredam, Vermeer, Poussin, Andrea Pozzo, Canaletto, Phillip Otto Runge,Turner, Delacroix, Monet, and Seurat. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FEMMES FATALES &amp; DOMESTIC NUNS: IMAGES OF WOMEN IN 19th and 20th CENTURY WESTERN ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In European and American art of the 19th and early 20th centuries, women were often presented in extreme ways: either as blood-thirsty creatures from Greek mythology, as Salome obsessed with the decapitation of a lover, as poison flowers and vamps; or as personifications of love and virtue, household angels, noble virgins dying out of self-sacrifice.  The literature and, later, cinema supported this dichotomy that can be still traced in contemporary culture.  In this course we will analyze the images of blessed and cursed women in Western art of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

We will study the late - 19th - century idea of the flaneur, which influenced both visual arts and literature. We will discuss the Futurists' fascination with machines and the Surrealists' concept of a city perceived as a human body. We will analyse the Impressionists' views of Parisian streets, Frans Masereel's woodcuts The City, de Giorgio Chirico's metaphysical paintings and Edward Hopper's nostalgic images of the American metropolis. We will study how the interest in urban reality has influenced the development of new art movements of the last two centuries.</COURSEDESC>

This course will discuss the way Alexander and his successors controlled their image in art and the styles of sculpture, painting, architecture, and urban planning that were precipitated by the socio-political changes brought about by his conquests.</COURSEDESC>

We will watch feature and documentary films, read literary texts, study self-portraits in painting and photography. We will try to define the special attraction and therapeutic role biographic art has for women. Among the artists discussed will be: Claude Cahun, Maya Deren, Meret Oppenheim, Leonora Carrington, Frida Kahlo, Cindy Sherman, Marina Abramovic, Laurie Anderson, Agnes Varda, Chantal Akerman, Francesca Woodman, and others. Students will do weekly readings; will write weekly reviews of films as well as a final paper about a chosen artist. Active participation in class discussions is required. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How are works of art reproduced (or re-presented) in photography and film? From the first photographs of the Sistine Chapel to the "mysteries" of Picasso drawing in film, this course will investigate the photography of art and artists in terms of the production of knowledge and meaning. We shall see that even the most "objective" documentary photographs of art are critical interventions that address the avid eye of the beholder. For example, Clarence Kennedy's photographs of the works of Renaissance sculptor Desiderio da Settignano has shaped our notion of Desiderio to this day, and Constantin Brancusi deliberately reworked his sculpture in the medium of photography in his own studio, forming a seamless modernist synthesis of authorship and form. Films about art and artists have attempted to show us the mind's eye of painterly painters such as Vincent Van Gogh and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Brassa's photographs of Matisse with his models have (for decades now) appeared as regular features on the pages of Vogue.  In our RISD studios, as elsewhere in the world, photography now serves as the visual record (sometimes the only record) of installations, performance art, and postmodern sculptural interventions.  We shall discuss images and writings on a daily basis. Students will craft essays on pertinent themes. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The introduction of Socialist Realism by Stalin in the 1930s terminated the Avant-Garde in the country and forced artists to become basically producers of propaganda. Despite this, a number of significant works, especially films, subverted ideological limitations. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTS ON SCREEN; HOW MOVIES REPRESENT THEIR LIFE, WORK, AND ADVENTURES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>When in the 16th century Giorgio Vasari described the life and adventures of Renaissance geniuses, together with their works, styles and ideas, art history as biography was born. Centuries after, in the 19th and 20th centuries,  psychoanalysis renewed myths, enigmas and aura of the artist as a complex psychological  subject. In the same decades cinema too renewed the genre of the artist biography and the documentary about his/her life and work.  Until now movies always update the artist's aura,  exhibit his/her 'body at work', narrate love stories, adventures and the  path to celebrity.&lt;BR&gt; This course considers films about artists of different times and countries. We'll see how directors stage artists or use actors to interpret them, their aesthetics ideas and political intentions. We will explore the artists' studios, working methods,  exhibit places, and listen to their  interviews.We will see how the film language reframes and interprets the life and work of  Caravaggio, Artemisia, Van Gogh, Picasso, Pollock, Basquiat, Warhol, Frieda Khalo, Richter, Kentridge and others, and how directors interact  with artists and their media, and with us the viewers. Course works: screenings, readings, group discussions, and two papers.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints: studying from the originals - curating a temporary exhibition at the Print Room of the RISD Museum This art history course pursues two goals - (1) to familiarize students with ukiyo-e woodblock prints as a distinctive, vibrant and highly influential form of Japanese art, and (2) to introduce students to various academic methods employed in art history in the art museum setting. The outcome of this course will be putting together a temporary exhibition of approximately ten Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints united by a certain theme, studied and presented to the public in correspondence to the standards of today's curatorial practices. Students will decide upon the exhibition topic, formulate the title, choose the works for display, analyze visual and contextual aspects of individual prints, perform the necessary research, uncovering cultural/historical/literary connotations invariably present in this popular yet sophisticated art form, write gallery labels, develop and deliver educational materials. Within the scope of students' work will be also the general design of the display as well as graphic design involved in preparation of labels and of the educational materials for museum visitors.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE GRAND TOUR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class will survey The Grand Tour - a cultural pilgrimage through France and Italy made by young British men and women during the 17th and 18th centuries.  The Grand Tour was designed to provide a liberal education to budding aristocrats by introducing them to continental language, music, art and architecture (ancient, Renaissance and Baroque), and to the sophisticated mores of fashionable society.   The Grand Tour also opened up new markets and opportunities for artists in their native cities and abroad. Grand Tourists returned home with crates of pictures, books, sculpture and decorative objects which would be exhibited in libraries, cabinets, gardens and drawing rooms, as well as in galleries built for their display. In this course, we will begin our journey in London and follow Grand Tourists on their travels through Paris, Venice, Florence, Rome, Naples and Pompeii, and examine the work of artists such as Canaletto, Batoni, Piranesi, Canova, Mengs, Angelica Kauffman, Robert Adam, and Hubert Robert. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar develops a historical and theoretical framework for understanding issues in the design and experience of exhibition spaces. Students will examine case studies past and present, including private collections, public museums, world's fairs, trade fairs, and retail environments. Discussions will engage with issues including architecture and interior design, visual strategies of display, ordering of objects, presentation of narratives, and political, social, and economic motivations. Class sessions will combine short lectures with intensive reading discussions and analysis of images. Visits to sites in and around Providence are also possible. Instruction in the two courses will be closely integrated. Students will be asked to reflect on their studio work to analyze historical material, as well as to draw on historical ideas to inform studio projects.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Senior and Graduate Level &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;This seminar is offered as one half of a six-credit collaboration with the studio course INTAR-7013-01 Introduction to Design for Museums and Exhibitions taught by Brian Kernaghan.

   <COURSEDESC>French Surrealism played an important role in the development of 20th-century European and American art.  The arrival of French Surrealists to New York during the Second World War influenced American artists and exposed more than a European audience to the movement.  In this course will study French surrealist painting, literature, and cinema in the context of intellectual and philosophical currents (such as psychoanalysis). We will discuss Odilon Redon, Gustave Moreau, and Giorgio de Chirico, the precursors of the movement, Andre Breton, the author of the "Surrealist Manifesto of 1924," Dora Maar and Meret Oppenheim - unfairly considered only as "muses" at the beginning of their careers. Special focus will be put on the work by Max Ernst, Man Ray,  Luis Bunuel, and Leonora Carrington.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUAL ARTS IN CHINESE HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course provides an introduction to the study of visual arts in Chinese history. It will introduce the major developments and themes of Chinese visual culture, interpreted broadly to include bronzes, jades, painting, calligraphy, sculpture, textiles, printing, ceramics, and architecture. The lectures will follow a chronological and thematic course through the development of visual culture in China. We will consider how to position these objects within a historical and cultural context, with particular attention to the interactions between visual arts and gender, religion, politics, and ethnic identity. Using formal analysis, and reconstructing production processes and consumption contexts, we will learn how to describe, research, and discuss objects of Chinese visual arts. We will also explore the recirculation of these objects, both in China and abroad, and how far theories and methodologies of Western art history can be productively applied to Chinese visual culture. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PERFORMANCE ART: BETWEEN MEDIA AND MASS MEDIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The main feature of Performance Art is its immediacy. As other forms of time-based art, Performance depends upon its documentation. The course explores the history of Performance Art through the media used to document it: photography, cinema, radio, books, journals, posters, objects, video, digital technologies and the Internet. The goal of the course is to show how the history of Performance Art is deeply connected with the development of mass media and technology in our society. Performance artists have been exploring mass media both as an instrument and as the content of their practice since the beginning of the Modern era. The course has an historical and theoretical approach, considering Performance Art from a wide perspective including social and cultural events at large and crossing the boundaries between visual art, design, theatre and subcultures. We will start with historical avant-gardes like Futurism and Dada up to contemporary art and activist practices like parades, flash mobs and re-enactments, passing through Action Painting, Situationism, Body Art and Relational Aesthetics.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*JAPAN: PAPERMAKING, TEMPLES AND PRINTS AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARTS OF JAPAN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material: its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture. &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Register for PRINT-4525 and you will be added to this Art History class by the Registrar &lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required &lt;br&gt; Registration begins on October 10 and ends on Wednesday, October 31, 2012.&lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRESS AND FASHION IN EAST ASIAN HISTORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines the aesthetic systems, historical development, and cultural meanings of dress and fashion in East Asia. With an emphasis on China, Japan, and Korea during the early modern and modern eras, we will consider the uses of dress within social, cultural, economic, and political systems, and the ways in which the materiality, style and silhouettes of dress have been deployed to express, control and contend gender, class, ethnicity, nationality, and modernity. Using a broad range of sources including paintings, prints and photography, fiction and diaries, songs and movies, we will explore how art historians and cultural historians utilize these different forms of visual, textual, and material representations to reconstruct meaning. Each week we will study individual objects of dress like the qipao, hanbok, kimono, and the ways in which these "traditional" dress forms have been reinterpreted in different social and temporal contexts. We will also examine topics including fashion systems, hair-styles, foot-binding, breast-binding, technologies of dress, and the way in which East Asian dress has been understood and framed by those outside East Asian society: as collectors and connoisseurs of "ethnic dress" or "art", and later on in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, as consumers of global fashions. Finally we will examine the position of East Asian fashion designers today and their complex relationships with the hegemony of Western fashion systems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Romantic concepts about the omnipotence of nature encouraged the ideals of human equality and democracy.  The Romantic search for truth, authenticity, and identity permeated empirical experience, feelings, and emotion. In this course we examine the visual expressions of Romantic ideals with particular focus on art of the 19th century.  We explore how images conceptualized morality, religious thought, nationalism, and human rights, as well as the new role of the artist as public intellectual, prophet and seer.  Readings from Romantic literature and a variety of contemporary texts will provide the social, intellectual and political context.  The enduring influence of Romantic thought on American art and life will provide our subtext.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The focus will be on the personal struggles, artistic innovation, and overarching achievement of a handful of artists including Willem De Kooning, Jackson Pollock, David Smith, Robert Motherwell and Barnett Newman, whose work catapulted American art and artists onto the world stage.  Concurrently we will examine the role of public and private criticism, especially the writings of Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg.  Additionally we will construct a view of contemporary society and the political leanings of artists and critics of the movement, as well as the concerted effort of the American State Department to showcase Abstract Expressionist work as visible proof of American freedoms during the Cold War. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Through close study of houses, interiors, furnishings, and a range of texts, this seminar will explore multiple concepts of domesticity and ways these have informed design practice. Classes will be conducted as collaborative workshops focusing on discussion of assigned texts and analysis of images. Student research projects will investigate a contemporary work of design.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE POWER OF IMAGES: ART AND RITUAL IN RENAISSANCE ITALY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course explores Italian art from ca. 1350 to 1600 within a ritual framework. A ritual can be defined as a codified, solemn, event that occurs within specific temporal and spatial cadres upon occasions such as marriage, birth, death, a ruler's visit to a city ('entry'), a calamity, or a feast day. Rituals work through the display of symbolic objects [here understood as 'images'] such as statues, reliquaries, paintings, elaborate costumes, or flags for which the role of artists was primordial. The power of images resides in their ritual use: colorful paraphernalia and sacred objects flaunted in city-wide processions could ward off the plague, honor a local saint, and turn princely entries or funerals into successful events. Through their symbolic and artistic components, rituals create authority, assert identity, define social status, and maintain order in society. We will study the extant objects themselves as visual evidence for such phenomena as well as representations (in the form of paintings and prints) of ceremonies, spectacles, processions, or ritual domestic settings. We will analyze art through inter-disciplinary methodologies: material culture, anthropology, social history, and iconography. Learning about artistic conventions and traditions will guide us to evaluate to what extent works of art manipulate reality in a 're-presentation' - rather than provide a mere illustration. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HAVC C503.

   <COURSEDESC>Jerusalem has earned a special eminence among the famed ancient cities of the world.  Its sanctity to Jews, Christians, and Moslems has made the city a focus of discussions and controversies regarding the evolving and changing identifies throughout its long urban history. Early and recent studies and discoveries, as well as old and new theories with a special emphasis on the Roman, Byzantine, and Early Islamic periods (ca. 63 BCE - 1099 CE) will be examined in the seminar.  A particular focus will be placed on how to identify ethnicity, religious identity, and gender in the archaeological record.  Though politics and religion have often biased related scholarship and the way excavations and their interpretations have been presented to the public, the goal of the seminar is to understand and examine various opinions and viewpoints.  This seminar will consist of regular meetings, with illustrated lectures, student presentations, and discussions. In addition to the presentations, weekly reading assignments, a mid-term exam, and a final term paper will be required.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as HAVC C729.

It is an introduction to both anthropological approaches to gender and to women's position in Asian societies. We will look at women in relation to religion; to family, marriage, and kinship structures; to household and national economies; and to various forms of political power. We will read about China, Japan, and Korea, among other Asian societies. The course will require a significant amount of reading and writing.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for all undergraduates. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: PHILOSOPHY OF DEATH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Socrates described philosophy as an intellectual preparation for death.  He recognized that how we react to, think about, and cope with finality tells us a great deal of what we think about the core of our existence.  Philosophers have been divided between a "bald scenario" that death is nothing but the end of our material existence to which we are limited, and the more reassuring view that death is a door to another personal plane of existence.  Death is nothing vs. death is everything.  We will examine these phenomena from philosophical points of view through reflection primarily on philosophical works but will include religious sources and literary works.  While philosophers have primarily focused understandably on the individual confronting death, we will constantly place these questions and their answers within interpersonal and social spheres of consideration.  We will focus on: What is Death? The role of death in the meaning of life; personal survival in various scenarios; ethical issues surrounding suicide, euthanasia, and other voluntary ending of life.  We will look at a few of the social practices surrounding death and examine their meaning and functionality. Intensive reading, writing, and participation in seminar format.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: REFUGEES, MIGRANTS, DISPLACED PEOPLE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course looks at key issues relating to migration, displacement and refugeeism in the world today. It frames these issues in terms of the factors which force movements and restrict the movement of people across national boundaries. It considers both the causes and consequences of such movements in relation to legal, political, economic, social and cultural factors.  It looks at the images of citizen, nation and state that are constructed through the regulation of national boundaries, and compares these with the goals, identities and cultural processes of the people who move or are across regulated borders. In working out how to think about people who live at the edge of conventional social science categories we will reconsider such basic concepts as ethnicity, identity, nation, culture and homeland.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING AND MESSAGE: INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF SIGNS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>We live amid a world of signs without which we could scarcely communicate or find our way through life.  The theory of signs, or semiotics, seeks to understand the nature of signs as vehicles of meaning in our perceptions and messages we send and receive in our spoken, textual, and visual communications.  This course moves from the analysis of signs and communication to a critical examination of the extension of semiotics to the surface and hidden meanings of dreams, handwriting, literary and art works.  At each step, we will endeavor to test the theories "in practice," to carefully evaluate their merits and limitations.  Through this, semiotics will emerge as a humanistic discipline that underwrites our critical and creative understanding of the world as well as funds our creative efforts to make the world anew.  Problem-based, discussion and lecture oriented with quizzes, practice-assignments, and short papers.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE WESTERN MIND</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The Greek historian Thucydides wrote that knowing the past is useful for understanding the present because, so long as human nature remains the same, things that happened once "will recur in similar or comparable ways." The Greeks of the 6th century BCE began a systematic, critical inquiry aimed at making sense of the world around us and within us. This "Greek Enlightenment" was as revolutionary and had as far-reaching consequences as the subsequent European Enlightenment. We will examine history's first tumultuous passage from religious myth to scientific theory and philosophical argument. Readings will be drawn from Hesiod, the philosophers before Socrates, Sophists, Plato, Aristotle, Greek poets, dramatists, and historians.&lt;br&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ANTHROPOLOGY OF GENDER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From an anthropological, cross-cultural perspective this course will focus on the ways genders are distinguished, constructed, and valued in different societies.  Although gender categories often draw on perceptions of anatomical and physiological differences among bodies, these perceptions are mediated by cultural categories, meanings, and beliefs. We will consider the notion of gender as a multidimensional category of personhood that encompasses distinct patterns of social differences, such as the Zuni berdache and the treatment of intersexed people.  In terms of gender diversity and social change across the globe, we will explore beliefs and practices linked to the formulation of genders in various societies and address the question of what it means to be human.  The course consists of lectures, class discussions of the readings, and films.  Requirements include several short analytical papers, two short essay quizzes, and a final project.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Loot? will study the history and analysis of the destruction of archaeological remains and cultural heritage by grave robbers, collectors, and museums. Why are the Elgin Marbles in London, and not on the Acropolis?  Why do there seem to be as many mummies in France as there are in Egypt? asks Sharon Waxman in her book Loot (2008). This seminar will examine the changing role of antiquities in the post-imperialist world, and access the moral and ethical questions raised by archaeologists, curators, collectors and lawyers regarding the plunder of ancient sites to feed an international art market.  We will also review legal standards regarding cultural properties (1970 UNESCO Convention,  1991 NAGPRA, and 1995 Unidroit Convention) and how they have impacted the protection of ancient archaeological sites, forced the return of many art treasures and lesser artifacts, and become big headaches for everyone involved in the preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;br&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Advanced and basic topics in the physical sciences are explored in this class. An overview of space-time and the expanding universe is followed by topics in: light quantum, the atom, and quantum physics.  Other topics include wave-particle duality, gravity, time, black holes, and the special and general theories of relativity.  Then we examine the unification of physics through the emerging result of (super) string theory which in spite of the incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics harmoniously unites (and also requires) these conflicting theories.  The already non-intuitive dimensions of space-time beautifully expand in the quantum geometry of string theory.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRODUCTION TO INSECT MORPHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Has the unfathomable diversity of insects ever fascinated you, but left you wondering where to begin? This is a basic course in entomology for the natural historian and artist. All orders of Class Insecta will be introduced, with both field and lab components whenever possible. Basic insect morphology and ecology will be covered for most orders, with opportunities for artistic rendition and use of both live and dead specimens as models. Students will learn basic insect anatomy and taxonomy for the identification of insects to order-level.  Elements of insect ecology will infiltrate everything we look at, in both the field and the lab.  Emphasis will be placed on the major orders (beetles, flies, butterflies/moths, etc.); the minor orders will be covered to varying degrees, but this can be adjusted according to the class consensus. Coursework will include field collecting trips, observation and drawing of specimens using a microscope, identification quizzes, and a course project that will emphasize the creation of materials for educational outreach. Additionally, students will finish with their own curated insect collection identified to order-level (or beyond, if student desires). &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Religion has long been a part of human life. Prehistoric burials include utensils and companions (sacrifice) for life in another world. Early writings pray for divine intercession or advise how to win divine favor.  Are beliefs such as these in survival after death and in supernatural beings reasonable?  Philosophy of religion asks this of these beliefs and others: Is belief based on experience (mysticism) and not argument reasonable?  Can the divine be proved to exist by argument, or proved not to exist (or care) by the prevalence of suffering?  Does the supernatural intervene in nature (miracles)? These and other questions will be examined through reading classic and contemporary writings, lectures, discussion, and student presentations.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SOCIOLOGY OF DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Technological change is often presented as a 'neutral' and 'dis-interested' set of processes that occur outside social, political and cultural processes rather than 'impacting' on 'society' and 'nature'. Much recent work in the sociology of technology has sought to contest this model suggesting that scientific and technological discourses are socially mediated in all kinds of power-laden ways. In this course, we will explore the contribution sociology can make to understanding the ongoing and dramatic changes occurring in the collision of technology, design, society and nature. We will begin by examining some central theoretical frameworks of technology studies variously inspired by the work of Marx and Heidegger, Foucault and Bookchin, Lash/Urry and Sennett; Latour and Haraway. We will move on to consider how these frameworks and related sociological literatures on consumption, commodification and the aesthetization of daily life might allow us to open up discussions about the sociology and politics of design. Finally, we will explore the history, culture and politics of various post-war, technology - inspired social movements from 'hackivism', 'sustainable design' and 'trans-humanism' which all share a commitment to re-designing social life and nature. Of central interest here will be to consider the relations between technology, design, citizenship and democracy and to reflect on the extent to which processes of technological change and design might be rendered more accountable, sustainable and reflexive.&lt;br&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

What and who are we in a universe of things unlike ourselves?  At its core, philosophy is a discursive, argumentative probing that pokes at our fundamental assumptions about the world.  The philosophical mind, of course, welcomes the challenge.  In addition to philosophers raising these questions, fiction has been a vehicle for raising these issues and challenging the status quo mindset of its readers.  Science fiction in particular, has long been occupied with questions regarding man's place in the universe and the limits and potentials of science.  While such philosophical probity rarely makes for great television viewing, there are a few shows, such as Star Trek, The X-Files and others, that are distinguished by their consistent philosophical texts in conjunction with the study and discussion of selected episodes from these extraordinary television series.  Participation, several short papers and group presentations are required.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIES OF ART, DESIGN, AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this seminar, we will take a social geographical approach to investigating a growing trend toward the merging of art and design - and the aestheticization of everyday life - with the social, economic, political and environmental interests of global capitalism. Additionally, we will explore forces within contemporary art, design and community practice that are resisting these trends; examples include a collaborative project involving artists, scientists, landscape designers and many thousands of citizens in "the production of capital" for soil remediation; the design of gaming that specifically draws on measured and predicted effects of climate change; a performance piece that draws equally from local knowledge, public health and medical expertise; and several art and/or design works, focused on justice, that take place on local/regional levels but intervene in larger global processes. Learning and applying concepts and methodologies of social geography (the study of social relations within specific spaces and places) to these conditions will help us gain the insight and understanding needed to evaluate the roles that art, design and community practice have and will continue to play in contemporary societies.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Plants shape much of the natural world around us. They influence climate and provide organisms with food, shelter and housing. This course will be an introduction to the vascular plant kingdom; its variety, classification, biology, and ecology. Through careful observation and illustration of live and herbarium specimens, students will gain an understanding of plant forms, structure, and reproduction. Field trips will facilitate the observation of plants in natural community assemblages, and will aid in students? understanding of similarities among plant families, as well as their adaptations to environmental conditions. Students will learn the Latin and English names of common species and learn to identify these plants through recognition of their unique morphological traits, as well as through the use of dichotomous keys. Students will learn the importance of documentation for study and scientific record keeping and will create mounted specimens of plant species for the use of all students at the RISD Nature Lab. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This course will approach the area of urban ecology from a natural science perspective.  We will learn about a broad variety of North American organisms  (vertebrate, invertebrate, plant and pathogen), from diverse habitat types,  and their ecological patterns and processes with regard to urbanization.  We will also conduct field experiments to evaluate certain patterns in our greater Providence landscape for ourselves.  Ultimately, how do urban wildlife patterns affect the lives of our species, Homo sapiens?  Coursework will include frequent readings, outdoor field trips, observational chronicling and group discussions.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONSOLATIONS OF PHILOSOPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Philosophy after Alexander the Great differed from what had gone before. Gone with Alexander were the small, self-governing communities in which each citizen had a place and a role to play. Secure in such communities, citizens had begun to philosophize in a disinterested search for knowledge. The conquests of Alexander brought into being a world-empire extending from Greece to India, Egypt to Kazakhstan. There were not citizens of this empire but unconnected and atomistic subjects of a foreign bureaucracy whose lives had been uprooted from all vital community. In such circumstances, people began to look to philosophy for answers to new questions: questions about their place in the world and the meaning of their lives. This course will examine the alternative communities that philosophy after Alexander offered to a vast, disenfranchised, and multi-ethnic population, preparing the ground for the new world-religions of Christianity and Islam that were to follow.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Witness trees, as designated by the National Park Service, are long-standing trees that have "witnessed" key events, trends, and people in history. In this joint studio/liberal arts course, students have the unique opportunity to study and work with a fallen witness tree, shipped to RISD from a national historic site. The course will involve three components: 1) a field trip to the tree's site at the beginning of the semester; 2) classroom-based exploration of American history, memory, landscape, and material culture; and 3) studio-based building of a series of objects from the tree's wood, in response to both the site and students' classroom study. Overall, the course will explore both how material artifacts shape historical understanding and how historical knowledge can create meaningful design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Must also register for FURN 2451.&lt;br&gt; Students will receive 3 credits in Furniture and 3 credits in HPSS, for a total of 6 credits.&lt;br&gt;  A single fee of $100.00 will be charged for your concurrent registration&lt;br&gt; Permission of Instructor required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most scientists agree that Earth is a place of constant environmental change. Much less obvious is what the changes we see around us mean in terms of human impacts and future conditions. This is partly because Earth's changes are viewed through the varying lenses of biology, ecology, evolution, oceanography, climatology, and geology. This course surveys the scientific methods and knowledge that underlie and unify these disciplinary perspectives on environmental change. Emphasis is on changes in Earth's climate and oceans, with ecology providing the primary point of reference. Course time is divided between lectures and group discussions, the latter being motivated by readings, observational exercises, and field trips. Scientific background is not required but critical thinking and participation are essential. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIOLOGY OF ANIMAL-HUMAN INTERACTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines how human activity impacts the animal world, how animals impact us, and how both are affected by the health of the environment.  We may find it convenient to think of humans as living in one sphere while plants and animals occupy another, but it's not that simple. All creatures share the same basic needs for air, water, shelter, food, space, and companionship - and we compete for these resources.  In order to maintain the balance necessary for healthy ecosystems, it's essential that we understand how one species impacts another.  Using a series of examples, we'll explore these connections, beginning with simpler animals and ecosystems, and moving up to more complex ones.  Topics covered include coral bleaching, the extinction of frogs, the use of DDT to control malaria, why dolphins strand, the future of polar bears - and more. We'll also study the potential solutions to these problems.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>While many tend to think about bureaucracies in emotionally charged terms (for example, Kafka and Orwell) or treat them with sarcastic derision (e.g., Parkinson), bureaucratic organizations are specific social structures possessing well-defined characteristics and following certain logic of behavior and development. They are present in government and business, as well as non-government organizations. Individual entrepreneurs and small businesses have to deal with bureaucracies to survive and thrive. This course will tell you how to behave around bureaucratic organizations. There are four major themes: organizational behavior, organizational boundaries, organizational environment, and interaction between organizations. Each theme will be looked at from the point of view of various types of bureaucracies: government, private, and non-profit. We will have a specific discussion of social entrepreneurship and its ability to navigate bureaucratic structures. Special attention will be paid to interaction between government and private bureaucracies. The course relies on a combination of lectures and in-class discussion. Students will be asked to write four short papers based on case studies and present them in class. There will be a final exam.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films.

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target differentcaudiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer- to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed for a public space or public interaction.&lt;br&gt;  The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy, and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>"THIS IS THE WOONASQUATUCKET": STORIES OF A LIVING RIVER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course invites students to engage as researchers and creative artists with the Woonasquatucket River, and with the people in its watershed.  At RISD we see the Woonasquatucket just before it reaches the sea.  But if we turn and follow the river upstream, under the Providence Place Mall, through Valley and Olneyville, to its source in North Smithfield, we begin to recognize the impact the river has had on the state, through massive industrialization in the 19th century to current efforts at environmental and social reclamation.  In this course we will study the river through story.  First, we will research the Woonasquatucket and its watershed, investigating the history, economy, politics, culture, and ecology of the region. Second, we will focus on Oral History, and learn the basics of interviewing and audio recording.  We will gather stories from people whose lives have been entwined with the river, paying particular attention to the expressivity of the human voice, and environmental sounds.  Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary work on sound and voice in poetry.  Finally, students will organize and present their work, and collaborate on a collective project of public interest.  How to collect and represent will remain ethical and aesthetic questions throughout.  Teaching and learning methods will include assigned readings and discussion; print, web and field research; field recording, audio recording and editing; guest speakers; and production/publication.  We will meet once a week for 3 hours, mostly on campus but several times in the field.  When we meet off-campus, travel may take up to an hour each way, in addition to class, and students should plan accordingly.  The course will be taught jointly by an anthropologist and a poet.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This course may be taken for either HPSS or LAS credit.

   <COURSEDESC>As over half the world's population has come to live in cities, urbanization has moved to the center of the environmental debate. This course will provide an interdisciplinary reflection on the past, present and future of ecological urbanism. Co-taught between a liberal arts and an architecture professor, (but open to all majors) the course will attempt to interrogate the ways in which green urban design has been conceptualized to date. It will interrogate the limits of present conceptions and it will explore cutting edge contemporary debates around the future of the green urban project.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Also offered as ARCH 1519.

Due to changing social, economic, and environmental pressures, the risk that genocidal violence will continue to affect people around the globe on an ongoing basis is great. This course is a critical examination of the history, causes, and consequences of genocide and related behavior. Drawing on theory and research in psychology and allied disciplines, students will explore definitions and legal issues, prediction, intervention, aftermath, and the factors that tend to promote or inhibit incidents of mass violence.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for all undergraduates&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Drawing from history, philosophy and economics, the course will explore how social entrepreneurs have built cooperative enterprises that differ from other conventional enterprises. Topics explored include the history of the cooperative movement, economic analysis of worker cooperatives, governance structures of cooperatives, the legal framework of cooperatives, cooperatives and sustainability, and the implications of cooperative enterprises for capitalist ideology.  The final project requires students to work together in small teams to develop a practical business plan for a cooperative enterprise that builds upon their own interests and expertise.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;BR&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AESTHETICS &amp; ETHICAL MAKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What constitutes the aesthetic values of objects? Do they consist of what affects our sensory experience? Is beauty only skin deep? Are aesthetic preference and judgment only a matter of personal taste; hence there is no disputing about taste? What happens to the aesthetic value of an object if we discover ethically problematic facts associated with it? What if the object's creation, maintenance, and afterlife cause serious environmental harm, compromise the health of living organisms including humans, or involve various forms of social injustice? Do these facts affect the aesthetic value of the object? Should they?&lt;BR&gt;   This course explores these questions that are becoming increasingly pressing today, as more problematic dimensions of artifacts continue to be exposed, while the aesthetic appeal of objects, in addition to their functional and economic values, compels our interactions with them. We hope to develop an informed, responsible and critical attitude toward the aesthetics of artifacts both as creators/designers and as citizens/consumers. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

How did people of the past use, abuse and think about nature?   How were their lives and aspirations affected by changes in the natural environment and by large-scale environmental events such as climate change.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

While the biological aspects surrounding the contraction and spread of epidemic diseases will be discussed, this course will concern itself primarily with the transnational, environmental, and technological factors that have promoted and sustained regional or world-wide outbreaks of epidemic disease.  Specific topics addressed in this course include: the connection between climatic or environmental conditions and the spread of disease; displacement, migration, and disease; and the development and evolution of medical institutions, quarantines, and public health systems.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing upon literary works to reconstruct and imagine urban life, this course focuses on the historical development of Istanbul - the capital city of the Ottoman Empire for 500 years and the largest and most important city in the Republic of Turkey today.  Economic, social, and cultural institutions, forms of entertainment, and communal relations that enriched daily life in Istanbul are addressed. This look at the pleasures of the city is counterbalanced by an examination of the vicissitudes of violence, disease, and natural disasters which ravaged the residents of Istanbul across the Ottoman centuries.  The last part of the class addresses the transformation and modernization of Istanbul in the nineteenth century and its place in the Republic of Turkey in the twentieth century.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergradutes&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course surveys the history of the modern Middle East (1800-present) and is designed to help students contextualize and understand political, economic, and social developments in the contemporary Middle East.  Composed of a mix of lectures and discussions, this course begins with a series of foundational lectures on important events and themes in Middle Eastern history prior to 1800 (such as the emergence of three monotheistic religions in the Middle East - Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and the rise, formation, and expansion of Islamic States in the early-modern period such as the Ottoman and Safavid/Persian Empires).  Moving quickly into the modern period, this course focuses in equal measure on the Arab Middle East, Iran, and Turkey.  The historical roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict are also addressed.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; HPSS S101 is a prerequisite for undergraduates&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>Global Climate Justice: Social Change in A WARMING WORLD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Climate change presents a problem of historic complexity, scale and injustice. It exacerbates inequalities between nations and social groups as its impacts are experienced worst and first by those least responsible for causing the problem. What movements for social change are underway in this context? What are the possibilities for transformative social action? What role can we play in catalyzing new solutions? Through readings, writing, film, field trips and engaged creative projects, this course explores the social science dimensions of climate change on a global scale, and seeks to re-imagine possibilities for social change in a warming world.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Where does our stuff come from? Who makes it? How does it get to us? And where does it go when we throw it away? This course explores the geographies of stuff: the places, networks, and infrastructures of commodity production and consumption. Drawing on scholarship in economic geography, cultural economy, and political ecology, the course engages academic and literary texts in a seminar format. Topics include: the geographies of global production, consumption, and waste; theories of commodities, infrastructure, and value; and case studies of particular geographies of 'stuff' like consumer goods, energy, food, and water. The conversations and assignments focus on the politics of critical making: on how to design and build a sustainable, equitable future. In particular, this course will debate the role of artists and designers in 'green capitalism'. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUDDHISM IN THEORY AND PRACTICE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This introductory course on Buddhism covers its three major traditions in order to introduce students to the internal diversity of this religion. It will be organized around the theme of the ideal of self-fashioning as represented by this religion's founder and central figure, the Buddha.  To do so, it will begin by examining Buddhist theories on reality and human character. Then, it will explore how these theories inform Buddhist practices and lived experiences as found in various cultural and social contexts.  The readings for this course will be primary sources, works of scholarship, and first-person ethnographies. Overall, this course is designed to teach students how to think according to an order of ideas and how to read and interpret narratives in order to practice thinking with metaphors and allegories as well as to practice examining human religiousness. &lt;BR&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FIELDS OF GLORY: SPORTS AS CULTURAL INFLUENCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In most advanced cultures of the world, the passion for sports has reached into many and unexpected aspects of society.  As participants or observers, we all, at one time or another, recognize the power of sports as spectacle, distraction or metaphor.  This course will examine the evolution of sport from competition among individual athletes in the ancient world through the rise of team sports in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It will then consider the influence of sports on language, politics, gender identity, art and architecture, literature, media, and apparel, among others.  Sports inevitably have an interrelation with class, race, and nationalism; and they have developed their own myth &amp; ritual &amp; hagiography, aesthetics, economy, cult of celebrity and statistical idiom.  There will be readings, assigned papers, classroom presentations, an exam and field trips to local sports events.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Most young people have developed their perspectives on the Vietnam War primarily through the medium of film. We will examine several of the most popular movies about America's longest war, such as "Apocalypse Now," "Platoon," and "Full Metal Jacket."  We will explore in particular the following questions. What is the relationship between the history presented in Vietnam War films and the history of the era as presented by professional historians? How might these films shape popular understandings of the war? How might these films act as cultural artifacts offering insight into American political discourse at the time of their production? Assignments will include reading, discussion, and written reactions to the films. You will need no particular background in history, film, or cultural studies to learn from and enjoy this course.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Shoes are an everyday commodity; but do you know how many are steps involved? In this course, students will handcraft a basic pair of cemented construction shoes from start to finish. This includes beginning by creating a basic pattern, draping the last, cutting (clicking) the leather, sewing (closing) the upper, building a stacked leather heel, and finishing the sole. We will approach the requirements of constructing a shoe through choice of material, characteristics of leather, and how to utilize them in laying out the pattern. In the process of the construction from pattern to shoe, we will work with basic tools for handcrafted shoemaking including a shoemaker's knife, closers hammer, buff stick, lasting pincers to name a few. Students are expected to complete one pair of shoes and begin work on a second pair, applying and expanding upon the techniques learned in the class.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $225.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Also offered as APPAR 2494 for Apparel majors &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BUSINESS PRINCIPLES: DESIGN AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Turning an idea into a sustainable reality requires a fundamental understanding of business, but the frameworks that guide business principles overlap, complement, and enhance design principles. &lt;BR&gt;  This course seeks to educate students to understand business as a critical design factor-- a defining constraint or liberating perspective?along the same lines that other design principles are taught.  &lt;BR&gt;  The guiding principle is that design and business are inextricably linked:  ? Design work is intrinsically linked to business and will always be at the service of business, fulfilling the need for an enterprise (profit or non-profit) whose business model is critical to its survival * Design will find new channels, new outlets, through a more complete understanding of business needs and how businesses see opportunity * Design can and should be considered as critical strategic input for business&lt;BR&gt;  The objective of Business Principles: Design and Entrepreneurship is for students to understand basic business vocabulary, to explore how design vocabulary and design processes overlap, complement and enhance business vocabulary, and to understand how design thinking skills can be used to identify and execute business opportunities.&lt;BR&gt;  This course will consist of a series of lectures, readings and case studies from the Harvard Business School.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective ID majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Nine thematic briefs are provided, from which students select two. Subsequent design projects represent the students' considered position on the relevance of the selected theme to contemporary design practice. The range of themes explored in the class broadens the critical discourse on issues pertinent to the field of Industrial Design and provides a segue way to the students' declaration of thesis topics.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement; ID majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Industrial Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIES IN PRACTICE: DESIGN THINKING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>n the Spring of 2015, Theories in Practice will explore Design Thinking. &lt;BR&gt;  Design Thinking applies design tools and processes to the production of ideas and strategies - typically for the creation of new business value.  The seminar will examine how contemporary designers are using Design Thinking to create value not only for business, but for communities and organizations as well.&lt;BR&gt;  Theories in Practice examines the historical and intellectual precedents of emerging areas of design practice. The aim of the seminar is to provide a space for critical evaluation of new and exciting developments in design that is grounded in an understanding of their intellectual foundations. The seminar draws readings from an array of disciplines, including: sociology, business, critical theory, as well as historic texts and manifestos from design. These readings provide a lens to explore the work and writing of current practitioners. At the completion of the course, each student will have developed a broad understanding as well as a measured evaluation of that semester's area of focus. To arrive at this understanding, students are expected to complete weekly readings, participate in class discussions, write critical reflections and complete a final paper.&lt;BR&gt; Theories in Practice is a 3 credit seminar offered through the Department of Industrial Design. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major elective; ID majors only &lt;br&gt; Registration is by Permission of Instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CNC MACHINING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This  workshop is a hands on experience learning the fundamentals of Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining. It will cover the basics of machine setup, tool selection, toolpath programming, and machine operation using a Tormach CNC mill and MasterCAM software. CNC machines are directed using digital information called G-Code to tell the machine how to move the workpiece relative to the cutting tool. A G-Code 'program' can be manually written or generated by CAM software, such as MasterCAM. These machining systems are used across many industries to produce everything from plastic injection molds to precision machine components to functional prototypes. The goal of this workshop is to equip students with a basic understanding of how these systems operate to facilitate independent experimentation and contextualize their own work within current fabrication technologies. We will consider the entire workflow, from 3D model to finished part, with an emphasis on programming techniques, workholding, and process troubleshooting.    &lt;BR&gt; Students will be required to participate in the final critique on the final day of the semester.   &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: Students may want to purchase additional supplies for projects per instructor approval. &lt;br&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL [LEGO] ANALOG</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As artists and designers, where do we draw the line between real and augmented experience? &lt;BR&gt; As technology flows into the many facets of our physical world, the answer is increasingly elusive. As teachers, students, artists, and designers, our ability to navigate this changing terrain will continue to play an even greater role in our work. As part of a two-part research project with Denmark-based LEGO Education, RISD faculty and students will explore the fascinating and rapidly evolving intersection between digital and analog experience, with a particular emphasis on its impact on learning experiences.&lt;BR&gt; Collaborators Cas Holman (ID) and Nicole Merola (LAS) have broken the coursework component of the research into two phases, a 3- credit Wintersession LAEL Research Seminar (Phase 1) and a Spring 6-credit out-of-major Studio Elective (Phase 2). Students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. &lt;BR&gt; In this Phase 2 interdisciplinary studio, led by Cas Holman and supported by Nicole Merola, students will further develop the research findings from Phase 1 through form-finding and prototype testing based research. The driving research question from Phase 1; "What is the potential of the digital and analog in proximity?" will become "What is the potential of digital and analog learning with LEGO bricks?" Two additional constraints will be added to the research; playful learning experiences with LEGO bricks, narrowing the question in order to imagine, visualize, and test experimental outcomes. &lt;BR&gt; Representatives from LEGO Education will attend final critiques for this course. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt; This course is limited to 15 students and enrollment is by permission. Enrolled students will receive 6 out-of-major studio elective credits.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>A Collaborative Study Project (CSP) allows two students to work collaboratively to complete a faculty supervised project of independent study. &lt;br&gt; Usually, a CSP is supervised by two faculty members, but with approval it may be supervised by one faculty member. Its purpose is to meet individual student needs by providing an alternative to regularly offered courses, though it is not a substitute for a course if that course is regularly offered.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Permission of Academic Advisor and Department Head is required&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORKS WELL WITH OTHERS: UNCOVERING THE MECHANICS OF COLLABORATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In a world where complex problems demand working well with others, what makes for successful collaboration? &lt;BR&gt;   To uncover the mechanics of collaboration this 3 credit course introduces current theories of knowledge negotiation, explores interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary techniques, and gathers the insights of select RISD faculty participating in ongoing art+design+science collaborations. &lt;BR&gt;   Works Well with Others is structured as a collaboration between participating students and faculty. Working together, we will formulate the research agenda that will guide the semester, share our efforts to understand what works and develop models of collaborative structures. &lt;BR&gt;   The course will be of special interest to students interested in effective collaboration with experts across science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEAM); using art &amp; design to enhance scientific learning (and vice versa); combining science in their art and design practices; and laying a conceptual and practical foundation for future professional opportunities that require interdisciplinary skills. &lt;BR&gt;   Works Well with Others is open to graduate (as GRAD-160G-01) and undergraduate students across the College.  The course is supported by the Rhode Island Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), a National Science Foundation initiative.  Interested students should contact Charlie Cannon (ccannon@risd.edu) or Chris Rose (crose@risd.edu) directly. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISUALIZING THE NATURAL SCIENCES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This 6-credit course (previously entitled "The Art of Communicating Science") invites undergraduate and graduate students to improve their skills in communicating and illustrating science. The general topic is changing biodiversity, how humans impact plants, animals, and their environment. Examples will be presented from around the world, as well as from Rhode Island. Through a series of exercises, students will practice analyzing and interpreting scientific information in order to both understand and present it. The science content will be delivered through lectures, visits to research labs, and to a nearby nature sanctuary. The course is designed to introduce students to relevant scientific concepts and challenge them to use their art to make these ideas more concrete and meaningful. In some cases, the goal may be to educate; in others, it may be to raise awareness, stimulate debate, or entertain. Students will explore the use of different media, including 2-D, 3-D animated, and interactive modes. They will also target different audiences and venues, including: general interest or editorial publications, art for public spaces including galleries, educational and peer-to-peer science materials. Class work includes assigned reading, several minor projects, an exam, and a comprehensive final project. &lt;BR&gt; Students will choose a recent research study on the topic of human impacts on biodiversity for the subject of their final project, which is a written paper combined with original artwork designed  for a public space or public interaction. The Departments of Illustration and History, Philosophy and Social Sciences will teach the course collaboratively. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Students must register for both LAEL 3912 and ILLUS 3912 and will receive 3 elective plus 3 LAEL credits. ILLUS major elective; non-majors will receive non-major elective&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The convincing depiction of form in three-dimensional space is one of the great conceptual and philosophic breakthroughs of Western art.  In this class, the first half of the sophomore drawing sequence, our main focus will be the study of form in a spatial context.  We will use observational and projected systems of perspective in construction of our images.  Emphasis will be placed on exploration of conceptual and physical viewpoint, effective composition and convincing light and shadow to shape expression, engage the viewer and create a unified pictorial image. The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

The class will promote acute observation of existing spatial situations, the invention of convincing imagery from imagination, and the successful integration of the two.  Exposure to traditional and contemporary drawing masters and practices will provide inspiration for experimentation, personal expression and artistic growth.  &lt;BR&gt; A series of perspectival studies will build into longer projects integrating observation and invention and concerns for figure and ground.  Students will come to grasp the elegance and power of perspective as an approach to drawing, tempered with an awareness of its limitation and alternatives.    &lt;BR&gt; Several black and white media in addition to charcoal (mixed media, collage, monoprint, caran d"ache, pastel, etc) and various ways of working  (line weight, cross-hatching, additive, subtractive) may be explored.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Rather it will seek to provoke insights that are best expressed visually and verbally, as humor. Humor as the means, not the end, of the illustrative gesture. A funny-bone to pick.&lt;BR&gt; Assignments will include inversions of expectation, the uses of the inappropriate, the various guises of the satirical, of parody, single frame cartoons, black comedy. Wit. ("Wit" is merely insight made delightful). These will seek to elicit from the student a series of illustrations that will be as self-descriptive as any portfolio, as definitive as any 'style'. Humor is intensely idiosyncratic, personal. But when it 'works', when it achieves its audience, it is a particularly intimate and effective means of communication.

What motivates an artist to explore one particular theme over another, whether it is a political issue, personal obsession, or a "purely aesthetic" interest? This course will require students to mine personal meaning in the narrative sources they choose for class projects, ultimately using these analytical conclusions to shape each project's character. Assignments will include the creation of the following: a storyboard; an historical narrative image, a series  for a book, a comic and a game or toy. Discussions will include: formatting a single narrative image or a series of images; telling text-free stories; illustrating stories for adults and for  children, analyzing plot, character, pacing, and style and communicating the essential meaning of a story to an audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective Illustration majors only&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for juniors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING WITH COLOR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Color is arguably the single most expressive and mysterious tool available to the artist. However, many artists who are skilled in black and white drawing have difficulty when they turn their hand to color. Crayon creates a bridge, which is at once less intimidating than more traditional media, while at the same time capable of producing highly sophisticated imagery. Through classroom exercises an awareness of the transformative power of color is awoken. Limited color underdrawings are further developed with multiple layers of color. The use of warm and cool color relationships as well as the exploration of polarities of color, in order to create rich, dramatic effects, is examined in depth.&lt;br&gt; Class work gives the student the opportunity to work from the live model.  For homework, the student is encouraged to engage in subject matter which has personal significance, perhaps something one had always wanted to create but hadn't had the opportunity.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will build on the skills established in Sophomore Painting, while broadening the students' understanding of options available to the painter. The primary work of the semester will be on individually directed projects, worked on both in and out of class. Overall, a goal of establishing a personal visual vocabulary of facture and image will be emphasized. Students will be encouraged to particularize their use of the painting medium and their approach to subject and statement through color, painterly touch, format, use of materials, drawing and compositional decisions, stylistic reference and implied narrative. The core medium of the class will be oil paint, but this may be augmented or extended by other media. The course will include group exercises designed to solidify a basic understanding of drawing, the use of the medium and the principles of color. Periodic outside assignments will extend this practice while emphasizing personal choice and expressive adjustment based on individual priorities. A flexible format for in-class work on personal projects will allow group interaction to coexist with individually directed work. The semester's goal for each student will be to define a direction for future work in painting.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This is a course on the history of techniques, concepts, possibilities, and purposes in landscape painting. The class will encourage exploration of landscape as sublime subject, as metaphor for human experience or as the battleground for politically charged debate of environmental issues, among other possible approaches. Students will work on location and in studio, learning approaches to plein air painting as well as incorporation of references in the construction of natural environments. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Open to Non-Majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE ARTIST'S BOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>At their very core, all books convey a sequence of ideas, but the execution varies widely from one volume to another. In this course, juniors and seniors strive to extend this concept outside of traditional book parameters to achieve their own creative interpretation. Working from their own themes, students mold an innovative presentation of images and concepts&amp;#8212;in two dimensions or three, using concrete depictions or abstract forms&amp;#8212;into the construction of their own unique artist's book. Assignments include the study of different folds, narrative problems, poetic counting, lost and found, and a free project of the student's choice. Students are encouraged to continue their own media that might include painting, construction, printmaking, etc. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAKING PLAY: GAMES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to play is a complex activity that is at the core of human learning. From Monopoly to poker, Doom to the baseball diamond, games allow us to explore social interactions, take risks, set goals, develop skills and expand our imaginations while entertaining us without serious consequences. What makes a game fun? Or memorable? In this class, we will explore the intersections of learning, experimentation, and play. In our constructed projects, we will search for innovative ways to expand or reinvent game traditions. Through individual and collaborative projects, we will examine how game mechanics (rules/systems) thoughtfully combined with game aesthetics (visuals/story) can be used to craft engaging, memorable and informative user/player experiences. Our goal is to develop primarily non-digital games that are conceptually innovative responses to various questions you pose related to play. Quality assurance and usability concerns will be explored through focus group play tests.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PROJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to bring a creative project to a full and successful level of finish is often neglected in the academic environment, but is an essential professional skill. This course requires that students meet goals they set for themselves through individualized projects, but that they meet them fully with the highest degree of resolution and polish. In a written proposal, each student will present his or her project for the semester: a graphic novel, a series of paintings or drawings, a children's book, a suite of prints or posters. Work may be in any medium, in any format and on any theme, but these parameters must be clearly established at the outset. Work on the project will be conducted in the studio during class time and outside of class, and will be focused on full realization of a finished product that meets the specific standards established in the original proposal. Consistency and quality of execution will be the goal, and less successful or preliminary pieces will be re-worked to elevate them to the level of the project as a whole. Students will have one-on-one crits each week and group crits as needed. Finally, students will mount a professional-level juried exhibition of the completed projects in the ISB gallery, with an emphasis  on presentation, marketing and a public opening.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from slow, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from slow, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>This course will continue the study of color organization and use of the oil medium begun in the fall semester, with increased emphasis on compositional structure and adjustment. Assignments will feature imaginative or hybrid compositions, combining observed and invented components. Using principles of color, directional light and spatial structure to solidify atmospheric unity, we will explore the implication and construction of narrative.  Work in class will solidify the student's ability to evoke volume, space and light.  We will examine the breadth of creative choice in representational color use to illuminate the expressive qualities of various options. &lt;BR&gt;   Students will study the role for color in directing the viewer's navigation of a composite subject, or imbuing a simple image with depth and complexity. Color design is introduced as an abstract structure that underlies figurative imagery, providing an important expressive subtext. Quick compositional studies in casein or gouache of a work in progress will be used to focus atmospheric and spatial effect. The historical development of  color use in painting and cultural associations of style will be explored in slide lectures and experimentation.   &lt;BR&gt; A capstone assignment will tie the principles of color and composition to a large narrative painting combining diverse imagery from reference and imagination, and emphasizing clarity and subtlety of structure in service of personally determined content.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

The success of an illustration depends on the seamless connection of these two entities. In this course students encounter a wide variety of subject matter drawn from a variety of fields. They are asked to create illustrations with a particular emphasis on the development of a personal vision as well as the successful communication of wisely chosen ideas. Style, its strengths and limitations, is examined in the light of its importance in the marketplace.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We will study the fundamentals of typography including its history, theory and contemporary practical application. Lectures and exercises will build in complexity from the study of letter forms and the classification of typefaces, with an overview if their derivation, to the effective use of typography in single page design. A significant part of the course will be dedicated to understanding page dynamics including proportion, grid systems and color. The final project will be a poster design for a local non-profit organization.&lt;BR&gt; Students will use Adobe Illustrator and InDesign throughout this course; so some basic computer experience will be helpful but not absolutely necessary. Students unfamiliar with the Adobe interface will be asked to attend an introductory workshop.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;br&gt; This course fulfills the Computer Literacy requirement for Illustration. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Portraiture in oils doesn't simply begin and end with a likeness. In this class we will explore ideas and techniques employed by great painters since the Renaissance to create truly lifelike representations. We will begin with limited color underpaintings and thereby establish the basic image which frees us up to explore color through glazing. As the semester progresses we will move on to opaque painting techniques and finally to thickly applied paint using the palette knife. Emphasis is placed on color mixing and the use of a limited palette. We will examine how color can convey life and how this can be achieved through the use of subtle warm and cool color relationships.&lt;br&gt; Although the assignments are essentially figure and portrait related, the student is given great latitude in the choice of subject and how it is handled.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Based on memory, dreams, fantasy, travel, and intuitive stirrings, each student's own journal will be the source of a group of paintings executed in a variety of mediums such as oil, acrylic and watercolor. In addition to their own journals, students may create images/paintings based on pertinent film, memoirs, essays, or other reflective texts by well-known and lesser-known authors. (Suggested references may include: Christopher Isherwood's I Am A Camera; Arthur Koestler, Darkness At Noon; Allen Ginsberg, Howl; Kerouac, On The Road; Elie Weisel, Night; Vladimir Nabokov, Speak Memory; Francis Ford Coppola, Apocalypse Now; Sylvia Plath, The Bell Jar; William Styron, Darkness, Visible: A Memoir of Madness; Julian Schnabel, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly; Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels; Frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz.)&lt;br&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Open to Non-Majors&lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE SILKSCREENED POSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Since the time of Shakespeare, posters (or "broadsheets" as they were called) have attracted the attention and sparked the imagination of viewers throughout the western world. The best posters are both visually striking and communicative.  Designs usually incorporate image and text; but are often effective with either text or image alone.&lt;br&gt; In this class we will learn the essentials of silkscreen printing in the context of studying a bit of the history of poster design: from historic fine artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha, to more contemporary illustrators like Seymour Chwast and Shephard Fairey. &lt;br&gt; Students will be designing and printing several editions, experimenting with hand-drawn and digitally produced art and typography. The nature of the silkscreened image allows for investigation of various color palettes or structures for a single image. No printmaking or digital experience required. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The course will also include historical and contemporary issues on the phenomenon of the printed shirt, i.e., uses ranging from social protest to advertising and the use of the body as a substrate for images.  A variety of techniques will explore everything from simple handmade stencils to the use of photo/computer technology to create individual designs.  Assignments will be given through the developmental phase, and in-class critiques will play an important role in determining the final product.  By the end of the semester, students will also investigate the business/commercial side of silk-screening, including at-home studio setup, recordkeeping and selling the product.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>2-D OR NOT 2-D</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Illustration is of course visual communication, but the vast range of illustrative statement requires varied and resourceful modes of expression to communicate with grace and force. Very often, and historically almost always, illustration has confined itself to two dimensions: art made flat, reproduced flat. But isn't it likely that for certain statements the best visual articulation involves the third dimension? Might not eloquence occasionally require that a line lift off the page, that color sculpt itself into shape, that form not be wholly illusory?&lt;BR&gt;  The answer is "yes".  The evidence and justification for this assertion, however, will be provided by students in this course.The semester begins with weekly assignments that combine illustration objectives with a playful spirit of exploring materials for its own sake. Simple ingredients include plain paper &amp; junk mail: cut, crimped, ripped, twisted, poked, prodded &amp; glued. Layered cutouts extracted from old publications will be added &amp; subtracted. Quick experiments will be the basis for compositions that will animate shadow boxes and tell stories.&lt;BR&gt;  Techniques with polymer &amp; air-dry clays will be demonstrated (modeling on wooden board for low-relief images as well as formed over armatures for more dimensional figures). Scavenged objects to be disassembled &amp; reconstructed in fresh configurations will offer another way to make images. Whatever the initial steps, pieces will be finished by incorporating mixed media, collage and other surface treatments that unify the whole.&lt;BR&gt;  The semester culminates with a four-week final project of stylistically-consistent narratives. Idea and technique come together in the resulting pieces; these illustrations will be anything but shallow.&lt;BR&gt;  So 2-D or not 2-D? That is the question. Or it will be after taking this class.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>3-D ILLUSTRATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While most illustrations are flat, working in three dimensions allows for the engagement of a whole new range of material and conceptual possibilities. Whether using plaster, Sculpey, paper clay, wood, latex, fabric, foam or found objects, sculptural materials are enormously nuanced in what they can suggest. In this class we will examine how objects and various sculptural strategies can be used to convey complex concepts and ideas.  A survey of contemporary sculpture and 3D illustration will provide plenty of conceptual, process and material inspiration.&lt;BR&gt;  Projects are structured to introduce you to a variety of materials and methods of working. Character design, model-making, casting, and work with found objects are some of the areas we will explore. A visit to the Rapid Prototyping facility at RISD will illuminate how digital files can be translated into 3D objects. Additionally students will learn how to light and photograph three-dimensional work for reproduction or portfolio. The class promotes development of personal expression, strong conceptual solutions, excellent craftsmanship and good design.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>VISIBLE CITIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A society's history is written in its stones. From the dystopias of Gotham City or Grand Theft Auto, the hive mind of the Borg and the ecstatic asceticism of the Shakers, to the suburban conformity of Levittown and the Sphinx half buried in sand, every city, every society, is an embodiment of ideas, history, geography, and beliefs. Each built environment has its own logic, both architectural and cultural. With some provocative writings about the phenomenon of the city as inspiration, you will be asked to conceptualize a place and bring it to life visually. The essence of a city - its buildings, pathways, public and private spaces - depends on how you define the character of its people, its government, its history, its geographic siting and even its language.&lt;BR&gt; After defining a back-story in broad strokes, you will begin researching the implications of those choices visually. Working from thumbnails and sketches to finished conceptualization, you will explore compelling physical and conceptual viewpoints, with a variety of possibilities in the use of media and technique. Rather than limiting ourselves to purely pragmatic architecture, the class will be searching for imaginative visualizations, where form becomes poetic metaphor suggestive of narrative.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PUPPETRY &amp; PERFORMANCE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Puppets can span an emotional range from poetically tragic to violent and irreverent and throughout history have been both venerated and outlawed. The goal of the class is to give people a basic understanding of puppetry philosophy, construction and manipulation and to gain a richer appreciation of live movement towards image-based storytelling. The course will be loosely divided into three stages: investigating what a puppet is, designing and building, story telling/performance. Each student will create a three-dimensional figure (or figures), either representational or abstract. Manipulation languages of the puppets will be explored to highlight their narrative strengths including the puppet's relationship to the puppeteer. Exploration of the means by which the story is going to be told and find what is most appropriate will be integral to course activity. The culmination of the students' efforts will result in class performance/presentations, either individual, in small groups or collectively as a class. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MASTER PAINTING TECHNIQUES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How did Caravaggio finesse such powerful chiaroscuro in his masterpiece, The Conversion of Saul? What's beneath the surface of a Titian? Why are the details in Rembrandt portraits so alluring? And how did Vermeer so perfectly capture the north light in his tranquil domestic scenes? Knowledge of painting technique is vital but often neglected. This course presents the techniques of four great Late Renaissance and Baroque artists: Titian, Caravaggio, Rembrandt and Vermeer. Students paint from life in the studio, deciphering the techniques of these artists in painting from observation while guided through demonstrations and discussions of visual examples by these artists. Four figurative compositions inspired by the masters are completed during the semester, exploring materials and methods such as colored grounds, underpainting, glazing and scumbling to better understand and build upon the unique contributions of each of these artists.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Open to Non-Majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

It includes development of both a traditional and on-line presence, discussions on specific industries, copyright issues, client contracts and pricing guidelines. Each student will create new work to augment their existing portfolio, as well as business cards, a resume, a contact list, invoice and letterhead. The course will also include visiting guest lecturers from a variety of industries. The focus will be to complete a portfolio that serves as a professional tool in the marketplace most suited to each individual's talent and aspirations.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration seniors&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ARTISTIC ANATOMY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students in this course will investigate the specific physical structure of the human body, with the aim of producing drawings of greater structural and visual integrity and more fluid descriptions of movement and weight in the figure. We will proceed through the skeletal and muscular systems at a brisk but reasonable pace, learning names, points of articulation and the dynamic functions of each component of the body. Each weekly assignment will consist of a careful, descriptive drawing of an element of the skeletal or muscular system, and a 'dynamic' drawing in which that same element is shown in action in the living figure. We will also review the work of artists, both contemporary and historical, who have made vital artistic use of the elements of anatomical study. The course includes an optional field trip to the Brown University Evolutionary Biology Lab to draw from cadavers. There will be at least one written test on anatomical facts and terminology. The course culminates in a final project on the theme of 'A Human Ideal', exploring past concepts of idealized form in the figure in relation to anatomical reality and contemporary cultural perspectives.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CREATING A PRINTED COLLECTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Become your own art director in this "learn by doing" boot camp that explores the transition of 2-D work into tangible products. In this interdisciplinary course, we'll learn about manufacturing and printing processes (i.e., books, gift objects, identity materials and more) by breaking down how to get from point A (concept) to point B (final, mass-produced product, suggested in the form of a greeting card collection). Manufactured products are frequently the territory of professional artists-whether through printed identity materials such as show catalogs and portfolios or through more entrepreneurial output such as the objects found on DIY websites and museum stores.&lt;BR&gt; This course is designed to create hands-on experiences for students to abandon thinking exclusively of "art for art's sake" by considering the potential real-world applications of art as tangible and functional objects married to the creative identity of the artist.&lt;BR&gt; We'll begin with the simple challenges of a printed business card representing your identity as an artist and work toward a larger project of your concept and design by investigating manufacturing options in Rhode Island and beyond. Understanding how to negotiate the technical aspects and restrictions of manufacturing such as budgeting, file delivery and set-up, and learning how to build relationships with manufacturers could serve you for a lifetime as an artist and entrepreneur. Critiques, visiting lecturers and suggested readings are designed to simultaneously inform and inspire.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING I: COLOR PERCEPTION AND EXPRESSION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Students will gain an understanding of basic color characteristics and relationships through observational painting and color mixing exercises. Perceptual phenomena of space and light are directly connected with principles of color organization on the palette, color mixing procedures and adjustment of color interaction in compositions according to properties of hue, value and chromatic intensity. The associative properties of color rooted both in the natural world and in cultural precedent are explored in relation to expressive priorities. Students learn the use of the physical properties of the medium, gaining sensitivity to qualities of volume and depth, the textural character of the artwork and the sense of artistic facture. Painterly precedent from the history of art and contemporary practice will be studied for inspiration and technical insight. &lt;BR&gt;   The primary medium for the course is oil paint, and students will be introduced to the complex layering and manipulations the medium makes possible. Water-based media such as casein or gouache will play a supporting role as vehicles for color studies and exercises in abstract color theory.  &lt;BR&gt; The semester ends with an extended project allowing the combination of observed and invented elements and emphasizing compositional color adjustment in connection with the artist's expressive priorities.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>ADVANCED PROJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to bring a creative project to a full and successful level of finish is often neglected in the academic environment, but is an essential professional skill. This course requires that students meet goals they set for themselves through individualized projects, but that they meet them fully with the highest degree of resolution and polish. In a written proposal, each student will present his or her project for the semester: a graphic novel, a series of paintings or drawings, a children's book, a suite of prints or posters. Work may be in any medium, in any format and on any theme, but these parameters must be clearly established at the outset. Work on the project will be conducted in the studio during class time and outside of class, and will be focused on full realization of a finished product that meets the specific standards established in the original proposal. Consistency and quality of execution will be the goal, and less successful or preliminary pieces will be re-worked to elevate them to the level of the project as a whole. Students will have one-on-one crits each week and group crits as needed. Finally, students will mount a professional-level juried exhibition of the completed projects in the ISB gallery, with an emphasis  on presentation, marketing and a public opening.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CINEMATIC STORYTELLING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine various storytelling techniques used in cinema that are essential in guiding the look and feel of a film. These will include storyboarding, color key creation, and production illustrations. Our goal is to build the essential skills needed to participate in the narrative process of filmmaking. You will work both individually and in groups on a series of assignments to create finished works that build your individual skills, and demonstrate your abilities to work on a story team in a cinematic production. We will examine camera placement and frame-to-frame clarity by creating storyboards for different scenarios.  In addition, to explore the emotional beats of a narrative, you will create lighting and color keys.  In the final weeks, we will create a finished production illustration for a narrative that will be either supplied or created by the student.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; restricted to Illustration juniors and seniors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Writing and image-making are both important languages to process and communicate personal ideas and experiences with immediacy.  How can they be used most fruitfully together?  In this class, we will examine the relationship between the voice and vision of the artist-writer through a series of projects that intertwine written and visual communication. Projects may include image-making which is stimulated by writing (or vice-versa), blogging and visual journalism for the artist-writer, as well as creative writing projects which consider a significant visual element.  We will look to Artist's Books and notebooks, developments in literature, blogs, and on-line communications.  Students will be encouraged to mine areas of personal interest in the development of a body of work.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course fulfills the Illustration Concepts requirement for Illustration majors.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course, taught by Bryan Konietzko (co-creator and art director of Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra) will take students through each major aspect of designing and art directing for an animated TV series. Students will each choose a style, either of their own creation or adapted from a preexisting one, to generate characters, props, backgrounds, color models, and background paintings that all serve a single short-format story. The curriculum will concentrate on cultivating a harmonious, expressive, and appealing art direction that is pragmatic for the applications and limitations of TV production. Whether the final goal of each art style chosen is 2D or 3D, the assignments will be drawn and painted, either traditionally or digitally, or by using a combination of the two mediums. We will examine how all aspects of design are paramount in the production process, and also potent and vital components of storytelling as a whole. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Junior and above &lt;br&gt; Illustration majors, open to non-majors by permission of instructor  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Building on the skills and sensibilities developed in ILLUS 2000: Visual Thinking, this course will address a range of strategic considerations important for the articulation of ideas. While emphasis will remain on methods for encouraging conceptual aptitude and innovation, there will be greater focus on specific forms of communication. Practical issues such as the nature of audience and the context for interpretation will be matters of concern, as will vehicles for communication and the handling of media. The basic aim of this course is to enable the student to discover a creative identity and develop an itinerary for upperclass study; its larger goal is to wed communicative purpose to artistic voice.    &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING II: THE ARTICULATE FIGURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The ability to articulate ideas visually is the most important skill an illustrator has. Building on knowledge of observed and invented form in space gained in fall semester, this class will explore the human figure as physical form and as a vector for narrative and expression.   Anatomical study, volumetric form, foreshortening, gesture, as well as balance and counterbalance will help ground and energize the figures physically. Narrative content and sequential reading will be explored in reference to the interaction of figures in a spatial context, and in relation to an imagined viewer.  &lt;BR&gt; Additionally the student will be asked to consider complex integration of observed, researched and imagined imagery in the creation of more advanced independent personal work. Drawing will be approached as an investigative tool, one that supports all aspects of studio practice, from slow, developed works to quick research studies for paintings or other media.  Narrative, expressive and conceptual issues will become increasingly consequential as students become more versed in defining , building and shaping their imagery.    &lt;BR&gt; Various media and methods of working, including a role for limited color, will be introduced.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;   Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

   <COURSEDESC>This course will continue the study of color organization and use of the oil medium begun in the fall semester, with increased emphasis on compositional structure and adjustment. Assignments will feature imaginative or hybrid compositions, combining observed and invented components. Using principles of color, directional light and spatial structure to solidify atmospheric unity, we will explore the implication and construction of narrative.  Work in class will solidify the student's ability to evoke volume, space and light.  We will examine the breadth of creative choice in representational color use to illuminate the expressive qualities of various options. &lt;BR&gt;   Students will study the role for color in directing the viewer's navigation of a composite subject, or imbuing a simple image with depth and complexity. Color design is introduced as an abstract structure that underlies figurative imagery, providing an important expressive subtext. Quick compositional studies in casein or gouache of a work in progress will be used to focus atmospheric and spatial effect. The historical development of  color use in painting and cultural associations of style will be explored in slide lectures and experimentation.   &lt;BR&gt; A capstone assignment will tie the principles of color and composition to a large narrative painting combining diverse imagery from reference and imagination, and emphasizing clarity and subtlety of structure in service of personally determined content.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Major requirement; restricted to sophomore Illustration majors; open to non-majors pending seat availability and permission of instructor.

Building on the theorectical understandings obtained during that prerequisite course, this semester is designed to assist students to identify a suitable thesis project. The discussions will refer to important precedents, many of which will have been identified during the earlier course.  The students will be required to submit their proposals for their own self-choice design project. Through group discussion and individual interviews, outline proposals will be approved in principle, requiring each student to prepare a feasibility report for their proposed Design Thesis. The design phase will take place during the following Spring semester.  The completed feasibility report will be submitted for evaluation at the end of the Fall semester.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement:MDes&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Interior Architecture department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORY OF ADAPTIVE REUSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Routinely defined as "transforming an unused or underused building into one that serves a new use," the practice of adaptive reuse is rich and varied. &lt;BR&gt; This lecture course will examine the pluralism of this practice through weekly lectures that focus on these varying aspects. The course will also focus on the differences in the implementation of this practice from countries in Northern Europe with its longstanding regard for reuse to countries with emerging practices such as China and Korea.&lt;BR&gt; The lectures will include case studies of buildings, unbuilt projects, and urban assemblages, which will be contextualized in through the common themes which are critical to understanding reuse.&lt;BR&gt; Requirements: weekly lectures and discussions, readings, a mid-term examination and a final paper. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major Requirement:MA, MDES &lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PRINCIPLES OF ADAPTIVE REUSE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course approaches the subject of adaptive reuse through the understanding of the rules and methods of design interventions. Analysis and synthesis regarding construction methods, structure, use, scale and the regulations pertaining to existing structures will be explored. &lt;br&gt; Building on the framework of the International Building Code for Existing Structures, this course also examines the feasibility of reuse as defined by construction regulations and practice.&lt;br&gt; The semester will be based upon case studies of completed projects in adaptive reuse to demonstrate the principles of design and construction within the context of existing structures. Through this course, students develop an understanding for the design process necessary in implementation of adaptive reuse in the design profession.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Assigned papers and projects through the semester require the understanding and implementation of these methods and regulations on projects of adaptive reuse.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major Requirement: MA&lt;br&gt; INTAR majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Relevance will be attached to the exploration of visual solutions that are viscerally grounded in the text.  Script analysis will be thorough and ongoing.  Group participation in this process is essential.  Students will be expected to read and research one to two plays per week.  All sets will be modeled, with fluctuating levels of completion.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Architecture &amp; Design Majors Only&lt;BR&gt; Class meets off-campus at Brown University, 50 John Street Studio&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course is primarily intended to provide some insight into the design objectives of the studio projects of the undergraduate and graduate degree programs of Interior Architecture at RISD.  As a studio introduction to Interior Architecture for non-majors, the course will focus on the spatial design concerns of the department focusing on how one carves, creates and occupies built space. Projects will explore the realm of work that begins with an architectural volume and transforms it from the ill-used or obsolete, to new purpose and viability, presented in drawings and models.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This studio focuses on creating space as a total environment to convey information - and experience books, literature and knowledge in a new and compelling, possibly even spiritual way. In this project typography and architecture will intersect.  &lt;br&gt; The site is within the second floor of the Providence Public Library's historic wing. In this memorable setting, the student's intervention should create a new, rejuvenated sense of space - one where the present and the past are in a dialectical relationship and where each amplifies the value and quality of the other.   &lt;br&gt; Space, structure and typography should fuse into an inseparable unity in the inserted volume. Students will integrate the written word with the erected forms using both traditional methods along with more experimental digital technology.  &lt;br&gt; The final project should form a space of repose, an ambiance fostering a different exposure to and immersion in knowledge that inspires new ways of thinking and feeling.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;  Open to All Grads&lt;/I&gt;&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Using computer programs which will build upon knowledge already gained, the course will be helpful to all those who wish to gain some knowledge of techniques which will enhance the presentation of design work already completed.  This is an essential aspect of the class, and should not be regarded as an opportunity to extend further design work on earlier studios, although some refinement of existing drawings will be necessary.

   <COURSETITLE>FINAL STUDIO PROJECT SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will be held in conjunction to the final advanced studio of senior UG students and intends to expand the advanced studio project with individual additional design and research studies. Building upon the offered and selected advanced studio, the seminar engages the student with research and design studies that expand the final studio and deepen the research on the selected typology and topic of the parallel studio. This will involve expanded reading, group discussions, testing of typology studies, further conceptual development and a writing component . The seminar should conclude with a booklet and a common exhibit proposal representing a holistic proposal of a given topic. This seminar will work in conjunction to the final studio where all senior students from different advanced studio groups will meet, discuss their projects with their peers and work on individual basis with the instructor on above outlined topics. UG Students in their final year will have the opportunity to expand their final design investigation to a holistic project, create a final book and present the work in a final Department exhibit.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective, INTAR senior majors only&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DESIGN FOR MUSEUM/EXHIBITS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This combination of seminar and studio work presents an opportunity for students to investigate issues and ideas that concern museums as they develop increasingly sophisticated stratagems for engagement with the communities they serve. In some cases these communities may be very local, and in others, the primary audience consists of urbane international visitors whose travel itinerary will always include visits to the world's greatest museums. In such cases, orthodox text-based captions of objects on display often do not properly communicate essential aspects, and as the expectations of museum visitors increase exponentially relative to their everyday engagement with the digital world, designers, museum educators and curators are becoming ever more resourceful as they compose and choreograph narrative environments. The studio will proceed through a series of short design exercises, each of which will introduce a different approach to the forming of a narrative environment, connecting with the museum visitor through diverse means of communicating complex ideas.&lt;br&gt; Through these design exercises, students in the studio will increase their understandings of museum design in the twenty-first century and be properly equipped to engage in meaningful dialog with those curators /clients whose task is to project their collections and special exhibitions as effectively as possible. We will discuss fine distinctions between notions of propaganda and a purely didactic approach to exhibit design. We will consider questions of how the essential aspects of a collection can be communicated most effectively, and how complex ideas can be effectively encapsulated for a general audience.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This studio is offered as one half of a six-credit collaboration with the liberal arts course HAVC-7013 Exhibition: History and Theory, taught by Eric Anderson. Register for INTAR-7013 and you will automatically be added to HAVC-7013 by the Registrar for a total of 6 credits.   &lt;br&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The sensor will be the primary tool for the creation of spatial experience. Actions are converted to electric signal and visual actions will output as sound, lighting, color, movement etc. &lt;BR&gt; In this class, students will learn the principles of digital sensors, focusing especially on touch, distance, sound. We will translate emotion to interactive space installations by listening to the sounds - rain, traffic, barking, explosions - that exist around us. Students will have one individual project for the 1st half of Wintersession, and conclude with one final exhibition as a team project. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00 (could be changed by scale of ideas)</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>NAVIGATING THE TANGIBLE AND THE INTANGIBLE: THE ART OF WAYFINDING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Images of street signs and mall directories often come to mind, but what exactly is wayfinding in the broader sense of the word?  How do people interpret what they see in front of them?  How do they move through a space, decipher a painting, or understand how to use a teapot?  How do people navigate their stream of consciousness to formulate an idea?  This interdisciplinary course will explore the role wayfinding plays in our lives across multiple scales and disciplines including the city, building, object (3D), image (2D) and idea.  Ultimately, students will understand how to guide the interpretation or perception others have of their work using principles derived from their investigation into wayfinding. &lt;BR&gt; This course allows students to investigate the topic of wayfinding as it is relevant to their field or discipline of choice.  Through sharing across disciplines and interests, students will gain an overall understanding of how people traverse the different elements in their daily lives, which will be applied to the creation of a final work in the medium of their choice.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SKETCH ME A THOUGHT</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course does not intend to teach students how to sketch beautifully, even though the improvement in sketching skills is one of our final outcomes. Rather, this class is conducted to help students to realize their full potential in the process of thinking through sketching.  &lt;BR&gt; Our thought processes make our creativity unique. Creativity and intuitive thought are often transformed in the form of sketches. Arising from our senses, observations, memory, conversations, and explorations, sketching is a tool of design thinking from the initial stage to completion, translating and visualizing thoughts fluently through different scales and complexity. Lectures will focus on the development of techniques that aid in connecting fragmented and different layers of thoughts.  &lt;BR&gt; This class will allow the student to elevate his/her design sketching so as to enable the dialogue "between head and hand"(Steven Holl).</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>GRADUATE JEWELRY SEMINAR 2</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The fall seminar concentrates on critical reading as an opportunity to locate, examine, and discuss your work within a broader field of inquiry. The additional objectives are to increase critical thinking, hone reading and writing skills, expand vocabulary, and build presentation skills. Woven into all of this is the understanding that research can be a valuable, if not essential, component of making - each informing and enriching the other. The focus of the spring seminar shifts to writing and presentation as an integral part of both studio and professional practice. Each spring brings a new team of guest instructors who introduce various modes of writing as a means to mine, develop and articulate ideas in a concise and authentic manner, and, to further hone that information into artist statements, written theses, and public presentations. Throughout the term writing will be the vehicle in which to move between private and public realms. This journey will begin with 'automatic writings' and culminate with your public artist presentations.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In the Senior J+M Degree Project students focus on a clearly defined, individually chosen, subject of inquiry for 12 weeks. Seniors are required to take full responsibility for the evolution and articulation of their creative practice. Two faculty serve as DP advisors, meeting weekly with students, to discuss and facilitate the progress of their work. Writing exercises are incorporated into the class to support the relationship between writing and their studio practice. Although seniors must be self-reflective in identifying the individual impulses and motivations in their work, emphasis in review and discussion begins to shift from the voice of the personal to that of the greater collective, context, and role of the audience. The DP culminates in an exhibition at Woods-Gerry Gallery on the RISD campus. Graduation requirements include: CV, professionally documented digital portfolio, artist postcard, and artist/degree project statement.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement, J+M majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by J+M department; course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SKIN: ADORNMENT AND CRAFTED BARRIERS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"Skin"; the notion of this permeable barrier has captivated poets, architect's, spiritual leaders, executioners and lovers. Both beautiful and macabre, the idea of skin excites and repels simultaneously. The void between jewelry and clothing begs to be investigated. Considering the broader definition of skin, how would you translate these histories, biological factors and psychological implications into body adornment and wearable's?  This course explores the intersection between jewelry and apparel by introducing materials and perspectives from both fields and beyond. A number of techniques will be introduced as a way to explore different notions of "skin". Materials such as leather, latex, textile, sheet metal and acrylic plastic will be introduced. The first part of the course is devoted to technical demos and collaborative exercises and lectures from both fields as well a leather factory visit. In the second part of the course students will do their own research and develop a project proposal based on their own interests. Students will receive weekly individual guidance and share their work through peer presentations and group critiques. The course will culminate in a public presentation. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $50.00 - $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;  Junior and above &lt;br&gt; Prerequisite: experience in jewelry or apparel is required.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COMMUNICATING SCIENCE THROUGH ANIMATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class, offered jointly by professors at RISD and Brown and in partnership with the Science Center and the Creative Mind Initiative, will explore and develop the pedagogy of using visual media to convey scientific concepts.  There is a growing library of online content but often times it is not well suited for seamless adoption into educational use. The goal of this course will be to assess the quality of existing material and design new material that not only fills an educational need but makes science engaging and accessible.  Class will be comprised of lectures, labs, screenings, discussions, critiques and guest speakers.  After an introduction to science teaching pedagogy and the basics of animation and visual design, small student teams with a balance of science and art backgrounds will collaborate on a series of short exercises leading to the creation of final videos or animations that explain scientific concepts.  Topic selection will be based on filling an educational need, where a satisfactory example does not yet exist and where the topic benefits from a visual presentation. Student groups will be paired with faculty mentors from the life or physical sciences to design an educational tool that is appropriate for a particular audience.  Projects will be evaluated on accuracy, clarity of explanation, educational value, engagement with the viewer, and creativity. The skills of lesson plan design along with writing, recording, animating and editing short educational videos will give students experience within the growing field of supplements to traditional learning and online learning.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Also offered as FAV-4599&lt;br&gt; Class meets at Brown Campus, Granoff Rm.

   <COURSETITLE>RISD/LEGO/DIGITAL/ANALOG PHASE 1: RESEARCH SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>During 2014-2015 RISD is engaged in an exciting, LEGO-sponsored research project: an investigation of the ways digital and analog modalities productively inform each other.  Cas Holman (ID) and Nicole Merola (LAS), the co-leads of the project, have broken the coursework components of the research into two phases, a Wintersession 2015 3-credit LAEL/NMSE Research Seminar (Phase 1) and a Spring 2015 6-credit out-of-major Studio elective (Phase 2).  While some students may register for both the research seminar and the studio, registration in both courses is not required.  Registration is by permission of the Instructor; students from all disciplines are encouraged to apply. &lt;BR&gt;  In this Phase 1 interdisciplinary research seminar, students will use humanities and studio methodologies to investigate, map, and analyze cultural practices and objects in which the digital and the analog comingle.  The overarching goal of the course is to constellate and assess a set of digital + analog objects and practices in order to draw conclusions about what makes these objects and practices compelling.  That is, we will be interested in examining the ways particular digital + analog objects and practices position their users-in relation to the object/practice, in relation to other users and/or objects/practices, and, more generally, in relation to the material world.  While making is an important component of this seminar, its focus is the theoretical/conceptual.  Through mapping and analyzing the specific ways digital and analog modes relate to, enhance, and inform each other, students will work individually and in groups to produce a set of research findings and exploratory inspiration sketches that will inform Phase 2, the Spring studio.  &lt;BR&gt; Coursework will include reading and viewing humanities, design, and fine arts texts/objects/practices that engage the intersection of digital and analog; using writing and making as tools for exploring the intersection of digital and analog; developing a coherent set of research findings that can be presented to and interrogated by peers and guest critics; producing exploratory inspiration sketches and a set of research findings to hand off to the Phase 2 Spring studio.  &lt;BR&gt; Representatives from LEGO Education will attend final critiques for this Wintersession course.  &lt;BR&gt; This course is limited to 15 students.  &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above  &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THEORIZING THE ANTHROPOCENE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In an article published in 2000, ecologist Eugene F. Stoermer and atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen presented data on human population growth, urbanization, industrial agriculture, fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, rates of extinction, and changes in land use to argue that we are living in a new geological epoch, one marked by the "central role of mankind in ecology and geology."  To demarcate this epoch from the Holocene, they coined the term Anthropocene, the "age of man."  Although scientists continue to debate whether to officially designate the Anthropocene as a new geological epoch, scholars in the environmental humanities have begun exploring what it means to re-conceptualize humans as a biosphere-altering geological agent.  In this class we will examine literature, theory, non-fiction, science, films, maps, and visual art texts that help us chart the effects of anthropogenic activity on the planet and theorize the Anthropocene.  Some questions this class will consider include: How do geologists define the Anthropocene?  What tools are necessary for reading and recording the Anthropocene?  How do cultural texts conceptualize the Anthropocene?  What role can the concept of the Anthropocene play in how we understand "natural" and "human" systems?  How does the concept of the Anthropocene pressure our understanding of temporal and spatial scales?  This is a discussion-based class with occasional in-class writing, two 2-page single-spaced papers, and a final paper or project.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: NOIR GOES GLOBAL</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Noir crime fiction and film have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity around the world: from Stieg Larsson's internationally best-selling Millennium trilogy to the rise of Havana Noir.   Why this fascination with all things noir?  Like classic noir, these new crime fictions from around the world serve to "unleash demons..bottled up in the national psyche,"  but, more particularly, they do so at a time when the very notion of a national psyche is being redefined under the pressures of globalization.  Combining gritty realism, moral complexity and striking visual and literary styles, these texts adopt and parody some of the main conventions of classic noir crime traditions in order to comment on the effects of globalization and its neoliberal corporate underpinnings.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEXUALITY &amp; SUBVERSION: FICTION &amp; FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Rope to Fried Green Tomatoes to Fight Club and beyond, 20th century mainstream American writers and filmmakers toyed with and hinted at-or even overtly confronted-the concept of homosexuality, often with mixed results. Critics, reviewers, and even scholars have generally labeled these popular texts "subversive," but were they? If so, to what extent and why? In order to explore these and other questions, we will initially investigate the term subversion (as opposed to transgression or "ludic play"), through theoretical texts and class discussions. We will then move on, to see how subversion might (or might not) work within and among the competing, complementary, and conflicting discourses in various texts. In addition to those listed above, the literary texts and films will likely include: Boys on the Side, The Women of Brewster Place, Single White Female, M. Butterfly, Truth or Dare, Madonna's Sex, The Object of My Affection, The Next Best Thing, and others.  At the semester's end, we will examine Brokeback Mountain as the 21st century's "answer" to the texts of the preceding century. Students will write several brief responses, give a class presentation, and take a midterm and final exam. In addition, students will need to acquire online or other access to the films.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SIGNIFYING LANDSCAPES: FICTION AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Landscapes function as apocalyptic, political, urban, imaginary, and nostalgic sites of great significance in fiction and film. Films like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Take Shelter, and Melancholia illustrate the environment's profound role in recent apocalyptic narratives. Cormac McCarthy's fiction in general, and the Coen Brothers' interpretation of No Country for Old Men in particular, place human violence in harsh, brutal, and ancient settings. Bodies of land are divided, raped, ruined, and transformed from gardens into wastelands of abandoned machinery and landmines--as in Salman Rushdie's Shalimar the Clown or Bahman Ghobadi's Turtles Can Fly. The Garden of Evening Mists, by Tan Twan Eng, like Amy Waldman's The Submission, places a garden at the center of the novel and its meaning. Other titles which provide an illustration of the course material include Barbara Kingsolver's Flight Behavior, Krakauer and Penn's Into the Wild, Dave Eggers' Zeitoun, Josh Fox's documentary Gasland, Wes Anderson's nostalgic landscape in Moonrise Kingdom, and imaginary places in films like After Life (Kore-eda Hirokazu), Micmacs (Jean-Pierre Jeunet), and Marwencol (Jeff Malmberg). Titles will change each semester. Weekly writing assignments in response to the reading and films are required.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AFRICAN AMERICAN DRAMA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course will focus entirely on African American theater. We will be concerned with the politics of representation and location, paying close attention to the relationship between the historical moment and the dramatic and performance texts. The meaning of the dramatic texts studied will be linked to their significance and potential social effects. Written largely during periods of turbulent social change, the texts chosen provide an opportunity to reflect on the transformative power of theater. Beginning with a broad overview of the issues and performance traditions impacting African American drama, we will proceed to the major highlights in the evolution of the latter. Notions of race, gender, class, and how these impact the retrieval of black people as speaking subjects will also be examined.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SHAKESPEARE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The name Shakespeare often conveys a set of commonly held assumptions about style and eloquence in the English language, British history, the power of dramatic literature, the protocols of theatrical performance, and Renaissance/Early Modern Culture in general --not to mention the "human condition."  In this seminar, we will work at "unpacking" some of these assumptions by undertaking a critical examination of the plays and poetry in the context of 16th- and 17th-century economics, political struggles, ideological shifts, literary history, thresholds of poetry and history, and the cultural place of the theatre as a new and controversial space of representation, performing specific scenes if necessary in order to show what this space looks like. Requirements for the course include regular short writing assignments, a modest research paper and a final examination.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BEGINNING FICTION WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>While the writing of fiction involves only the writer and the page, the group workshop affords the writer the opportunity to explore, develop and refine his or her work in a small community focused on a single goal. This environment of craft and creativity is particularly critical to the beginning writer. As with any craft, revision is the key to effective storytelling. The revision process will be emphasized. Short fiction by leading writers will be read and discussed; elements of craft will be explored; students will learn to deliver criticism in a supportive, constructive way; but learning by doing will comprise the majority of the class. Writing will begin in the first class, leading to small, peer-driven workshop groups and culminating in a full class workshop at semester's end. Students will produce three stories throughout the semester, all of which will be workshopped and revised. The student's engagement in the course, participation and attendance, will drive the final grades.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Why is it that the elaborate and expensive videography of Matthew Barney is named "art" while the equally expensive and elaborate videography of Mariah Carey is only "performance?"  How much of such categorization is about a pure assessment of the artistic end product, and how much more is about the social-cultural baggage (gender, race, socio-economic class) that underwrites the process of performance-making?  This course will probe the dys/functional marriage between "performance" and "art" through the conceptual tool of "craft." While we will of course consider the history of performance art, this is not a survey course. Rather, using speech-act theory of performativity as groundwork, we will theorize and finesse the creative process by which the human body becomes a compelling medium of object-making.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORICAL FICTION: WRITING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>As a writer of historical fiction, I am drawn to set stories in the past for many reasons: fascination with another world or way of life, a desire to understand today's world through a study of the past, the desire to time-travel and experience another world through fiction. Students are invited to bring their passions and interests to the table in this course that will combine two disciplines, the study of history and the literary arts. Short works of historical fiction and discussions of craft specific to historical fiction will be read and discussed. Research techniques and resources will be examined. Students will produce one work of historical analysis that relies on the use of primary and secondary sources. The latter half of the semester will be focused on producing and workshopping fiction set in the past. The course assumes a familiarity with the writing of short fiction and the basic elements of craft. Previous courses in creative writing are preferred but not required; registration is by permission of the instructor and based on the submission of a creative writing sample.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to sophomores and above. Interested students should contact tpolites@risd.edu.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ACTING WORKSHOP</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Taught by a working professional actor/director, this introduction to acting will lead the beginning student through the artistic process involved in acting for the stage and other media. Through exercises, study of technique, scene work and improvisation, the student will work to develop natural abilities and will become familiar with the working language and tools of the modern actor.  Emphasis in this class will be on the physical self, mental preparation, the imagination, and discipline.  Written work will include keeping a journal and writing a character analysis.  Perfect attendance in this course is vital and mandatory.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Hollywood films:  how are they "written" by directors, performers, scriptcrafters, cameramen and producers?  We will view a selection of films featuring directors who stamped Hollywood and us with their visions, often from other cultures.  We will also study the direction Hollywood took in interpreting the Depression, War, and Recovery, and the direction stars, writers and designers chose in defining themselves.  This is a course in criticism, history and articulate appreciation.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course will examine the dual Haitian Revolution as a pivotal moment in the making of the modern world. It will review the various historical interpretations of the Haitian events, examine how these events contribute to or trouble our ideas about modern politics and notions of freedom as well as our conceptions of revolution. The course will engage in these issues working through three archives: Vodou Religion, The Art of the Revolution and conventional historiography about the revolution.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;This course is in collaboration with Brown University.&lt;br&gt;  This course will be held at Brown University's Churchill House, 155 Angell Street, Africana Studies Department, Room 106 during Fall 2014. &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This discussion-based course surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry, from the late Middle Ages to the Eighteenth Century, with emphasis on the way these works relate to broad cultural phenomena in other areas, including philosophy, theology, and visual arts.  Regular homework emphasizes independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your own insights with those gained from casual and scholarly research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Chaucer (3 Canterbury Tales), Spenser, Sidney, Shakespeare (Sonnets and The Tempest), Donne, Marvell, Herbert, Herrick, Milton, Bunyan, Butler, Behn, Rochester, Locke, Dryden, Pope, Hogarth, Gray, Boswell and Johnson. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THINGAMAJIGIRL: OBJECTS, HUMANS, FEMININITY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>What does it mean to be a "thing"?   What does it feel like to be a "thing"?  We all feel that we know how it feels to be "human": we are not "things," or "inanimate objects."  But what we don't often question is the emotional and social valuations put upon the relationship between humans and things.  For most of us, to be treated "as a thing" is to be de-humanized, de-valued, the nadir of existence.  This course will question that binaristic tradition of conceptualizing objects through the lens of femininity.  Cross-culturally but especially within the Western-European world, women have been treated as "things": toys, trophies, dolls, ornaments, are all metonyms for "female." By studying literary and cultural texts as well as art produced by women and women-identified authors, we will rigorously and critically examine the multiple functions, oppressive and subversive, of the linkages between "woman" and "thing," and in turn, re-think the idea of the object.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course examines contemporary American fiction and film, meaning that the narratives (family narratives, historical narratives, and so on) were written or produced within the past twenty years. Specific titles will change each semester in an effort to study current ideas and styles. Writers of significant stature in American literature, like Philip Roth and Cormac McCarthy, will be included, as will notable new writers, including Adam Johnson, Marisha Pessl, and Jennifer Egan.  A film will be scheduled and discussed during class each week. While some narratives directly confront contemporary American culture, others may look at the present indirectly, using history, or focus on events in other parts of the world, as in Paul Theroux's The Lower River.  Attention will be paid to satirical portraits of the American family and to political narratives, whether they address global conflicts or the politics of work, family, friendship, identity, love, and sex. Short interpretive papers will be required in response to the fiction and film each week.  Class attendance and thoughtful participation are mandatory. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PICTURE AND WORD</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A workshop-style course which combines English with a studio project for students with an interest in children's picture books.  Students will learn to develop storytelling skills (imagination, language, plot, character, and voice) and illustration techniques (characterization, setting, page, layout) by studying picture books and completing writing and illustration assignments.  For their final projects, students will be expected to produce an original text, sketch dummy, and two to four finished pieces of art.  The class will also include an overview of publishing procedures and published writers/illustrators will be invited to share their experiences and critique students' work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students who register for this course must register for both LAS E416 and ILLUS 3612 for a total of 6 credits.

   <COURSETITLE>CONTEMPORARY CRITICAL THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will provide students with a foundation in the major movements, debates, and thinkers of 20th- and 21st-century critical theory. We will begin from both Marxist and psychoanalytic engagements with semiotics, visuality, mass media, sexuality, and representation. Proceeding through structuralism and post structuralism, we will examine the important contemporary debates about the individual's relationship to identity, aesthetics, power, history, technology, and the lived environment taking place in recent feminism, queer and postcolonial theory, and eroticism.  No previous familiarity with critical theory is required. Critics will include Marx, Freud, Lacan, Foucault, Benjamin, Lukacs, Adorno, Barthes, Derrida, Althusser, Crary, Baudrillard, Butler, Harraway, Said, Chow, and Zizeck.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Postcolonial literature is the writing produced by people in or from regions that have escaped the yoke of colonialism.  Of course, such a definition raises a number of questions, and during the semester we will grapple with the definition.  Our reading will open with several theoretical discussions of postcoloniality, then we will continue with novels and poetry from Africa, the Caribbean, and Latin America.  The spectre of slavery and its repercussions will reverberate in many of the readings.  Through individual projects and a final paper that works with at least one of the theoretical texts and a novel or a book of poetry, students can begin to focus on the area in the field that specifically interests them. Writers may include Chinua Achebe, Isabel Allende, Michelle Cliff, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, George Lamming, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Derek Walcott.</COURSEDESC>

The shape of the course will be organically formed in large part by the degree projects of the members of the course.  We will work through theories that interface textuality with visual, digital, tactile and performance art while working to hone the development of individual projects.  The majority of course work will be specifically designed for each course member. &lt;i&gt; Registration is by instructor permission only.  Please email to the instructor a description of your degree project, and why it would benefit from an intensified study in textuality.  Include your name, major, and rank.  (Note that the course is only open to Juniors, Seniors, 5th Years and Graduate Students.) &lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: LITERARY ART: BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This class can be taken for credit in either LAS or HAVC.  William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Offered as LAS-C221 or HAVC-C221. Register into the course for which credit is desired. &lt;/I&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>AFTER BABEL: LITERATURE IN THE TIME OF GLOBALIZATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The course examines the ways in which literature responds to the utopian dreams and dystopian nightmares engendered in the current moment of globalization. Are we still living in the ruins of Babel -- defined by conflict, fragmentation, and mutual incomprehension? Or is this a time of harmony and translucent immediacy when neither linguistic nor cultural translation is necessary? What happens to notions of language and humanity as literature and life both become disposable; as origins become untraceable; and as forms of violence -- whether terrorist, revolutionary, or poetic -- are seen to infect the everyday? Readings include late-20th century and contemporary novels and poetry from post-totalitarian Chile, post-unification Europe, de-secularizing Turkey, post-colonial South Asia and Nigeria, post-socialist Poland, and post-revolutionary Algeria (Roberto Bolao, Juan Goytisolo, Orhan Pamuk, Amitav Ghosh, Chris Abani, Michal Witkowski, Assia Djebar). These texts will be supplemented by films and theoretical essays.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LIARY: PROSE STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The word "liary" references the seven volumes of Anais Nin's diaries, which, upon their publication, were denounced by Nin's friends as utter fiction, as the "liary."  This course will treat this insult as the basis for a literary genre: the fiction of life itself.  We will focus on the production of liaries: fiction using real life - your own.  But rather than thinking about lived experience as the raw material of fiction which finds expression through words, we will think about words themselves as the medium through which the fiction of life can be constructed.  In this course, we will be fully invested in the materiality of words and the functionality of fiction.  We will collide with words as if they were a particularly willful batch of clay, to find different ways in which fictionality is created when a word is imagined to give contour to the slippery moments of living.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Although it dovetails with LAS E211, usually offered in the fall, this discussion-based course can be taken by itself.  It surveys major and minor works of British literature, mostly poetry and prose fiction, from the late 1700s to the early 20th century, with consideration of the way these works relate to broad social and cultural phenomena including philosophy, gender politics, aesthetics and visual arts.  Regular homework exercises emphasize independent critical and investigative reading of complex texts and images; formal writing assignments develop your ability to combine your insights with those gained from research, open-book midterm and final exams allow you to demonstrate your ability to analyze unfamiliar works and place them in context with those we have studied.  Readings include (mostly short) works by Charlotte Smith, Blake, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley (Transformation), Tennyson, Elizabeth B. and Robert Browning, Hopkins, Housman, Yeats, Stevenson (Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde), Conrad (Secret Sharer) and Lawrence. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BIRDS IN BOOKS</COURSETITLE>

Hudson--the bird as woman--and examine the bird as omen and warning--the ecological and environmental indicator of human fate.  Our books include such recent essays and memoirs as Jonathan Safran Foer's &lt;i&gt;Eating Animals&lt;/i&gt; -- an indictment of the poultry industry and a plea for vegetarianism--and also the arguments both personal/subjective and yet also scientific for the intelligence of birds such as the bestseller books &lt;i&gt;Alex: The Parrot that Owned Me&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wesley the Barn Owl,&lt;/i&gt; in which birds appear not so much as pets but rather as companion creatures who share our destiny and condition.&lt;BR&gt; Our course will include actual birdwatching during times of migration or nest-building, either locally within the borders of our campus world, or beyond its frontiers.  Migration has always meant the crossing of national barriers, and therefore a promise of peace and order despite the turmoil under the skies.  We read, we watch, and we design projects relevant to the various meanings of birds to be found in books.</COURSEDESC>

This course seeks to approach these questions through readings that may include works by Brecht, Fo, Heaney, Boal, Wilson, Churchill, Stoppard, Edgar, Tendulkar, Soyinka, Fugard, Fusco, Deavere Smith, Kushner and Nottage along with relevant theoretical texts. Screenings might range from recent US election videos to the acts of contemporary culture jamming activists like "The Yes Men."&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>"PRINT THE LEGEND": THE WESTERN AS FILM AESTHETIC, NATIONAL HISTORY, AND INTERNATIONAL MYTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Taking its cue from Clint Eastwood who proclaimed, "As far as I'm concerned, Americans don't have any original art except Western movies and jazz," this course will analyze the Western film as an art form in and of itself. We will discuss Westerns in terms of their specific aesthetic and technological influence on the medium, their cultural expression of a national political unconscious, and their global function as the meta-narrative of space. This course will tackle these discussions through a chronological unfolding of the genre starting with the Edison Company's 1898 Westerns and Edwin S. Porter's &lt;i&gt;The Great Train Robbery (1903)&lt;/i&gt; through the Golden Age of John Ford and Howard Hawks' films and the reciprocal translation of Akira Kurosawa's epics, and finally, to the variants of the Spaghetti, Revisionist, and genre-bending contemporary and postmodern Westerns of Dennis Hopper, Sam Peckinpah, John Sayles, Jim Jarmusch, Ang Lee, and Wim Wenders. There will be required readings in critical film theory, weekly screenings, analytical essays, and oral presentations.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>FROM LITERARY TO CULTURAL STUDIES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Cultural studies has made its mark in the humanities as a structured discipline since the 1960s. It emerged from a dissatisfaction with traditional literary criticism and sought to widen the latter's focus on aesthetic masterpieces of "high" culture by incorporating "low," popular, and mass culture in an interdisciplinary analysis of "texts," their production, distribution and consumption. Varied "texts" from the world of art, film, TV, advertising, detective novels, music, folklore, etc., as well as everyday objects, discourses, and institutions have since been discussed in their social, historical, ideological and political contexts. This course will provide an introduction to the field and its concerns.  It will also encourage students to practice some of its modes of analysis.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>QUEER FICTION AND THEORY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In the 1990s Queer Theory emerged as a critique of the ways in which power institutionalizes and thereby legitimates certain forms of sexuality while marginalizing others.  Sue-Ellen Case, a performance theorist, claims that "queer theory works not at the site of gender, but at the site of ontology, to shift the ground of being itself. Queer revels constitute a kind of activism that attacks the dominate notion of the natural. The queer is the taboo-breaker, the monstrous, the uncanny" (quoted from Queer Theories). Through our readings of seminal queer theorists such Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Eve Sedgwick, and Gayle Rubin, we will explore important questions about the politics of queerness. Our investigation will focus on sexuality and gender, closeting, homophobia and drag, the aesthetics of queer literature, and the ways queer writers such as Leslie Feinberg, Kate Bornstein, and Randall Kenan interrogate and inscribe such subjects in their work.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: FAMILY NARRATIVES</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Tolstoy's famous opening sentence of Anna Karenina reminds us that families provide a lot of good material for fiction and film narratives. "All happy families resemble one another," he writes, "but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way." This seminar will take a look at unhappy and happy families alike and will consider alternative or surrogate family structures and definitions of home. Contemporary writers like Jhumpa Lahiri, Michael Cunningham, Philip Roth, Chang-rae Lee, Jonathan Safran Foer, and Jeffrey Eugenides, just to name a few, take us inside homes where identities are formed and where they clash. We will also study family portraiture in film to extend our understanding of the subject's narrative possibilities.  Students must be prepared to participate in class, must know how to read narratives closely, and must be able to write specific and detailed papers each week in response to assigned material.  Research outside of the class material is expected.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SEM: "EATING THE WAY BACK HOME": Food, Literature, and Identity</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In "The Wretched of the Earth" (1961), Frantz Fanon writes, "The relations of man with matter, with the world outside, and with history are in the colonial period simply relations with food." Fanon recognizes that for the colonized subject existence itself is so threatened that every bit of food one can gain access to is, as he writes, "a victory felt as a triumph for life." The foods people choose to eat and the ways they prepare those foods speak volumes about their relationship to the land and reflect their history. Postcolonial storytellers, writers, and filmmakers use food and foodways as markers of independence, as symbols of cultural colonization, and as signs of continued deprivations. Through foodways one can glimpse famines, invasions, and historical access to trade networks, and food itself can even serve as a vehicle for communication. Since these stories are not constructed in a vacuum, they also can reveal something about what food means in specific historical moments, in specific places, and for specific populations. This course will look at the roles food and foodways play in a series of narratives from formerly colonized spaces. Writers we will read may include Chris Abani, Bessie Head, Tsitsi Dangarembga, and Ken Saro-Wiwa.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Sophomore and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PALEOGRAPHY: WESTERN HANDWRITTEN LETTERFORMS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This Liberal Arts Elective is a hands-on investigation of the development of Latin handwritten letters from about 200 BCE to about 1500 CE, analyzing scripts and script families from Roman cursive and monumental letters to the Renaissance letters that were the basis of most modern fonts. The emphasis of the course is on dynamic analysis of letters as written rather than static forms, though we will also explore the implications of the Platonic and later organic/evolutionary models that are the traditional means for understanding the history of letterforms.  Students will master a basic Italic hand; study and write versions of a dozen or more historical scripts originally executed with styli, brushes, and reed, quill, and metal pens; make pens from river reeds and other materials (and write with them); and investigate the properties of papyrus, wood, vellum, and paper as writing surfaces. The class will visit at least one museum, spend extensive time outside of class practicing letters, and write two papers involving the historical contexts, paleographic characteristics, and calligraphic/graphic procedures for particular handwritten manuscripts. Although all the scripts studied were originally written right-handed, left-handed students have excelled in the course.</COURSEDESC>

Students in this course will be asked to: audition for, rehearse and perform assigned speaking and/or non-speaking roles; express preferences for leading and/or assisting in design areas (sets, costume, sound, lighting, etc.); accept assigned duties on design, construction and stage management crews; commit to a flexible rehearsal/construction schedule outside of class meetings; and pursue a guided study of the dramaturgical and production elements of the play or plays being produced. Under consideration for this Wintersession production is a selection of short plays by modern masters/"geniuses" such as Tennessee Williams, Samuel Beckett, Thornton Wilder, David Mamet, etc. The structure of the selected play will be analyzed for its themes and historic context as well. The play will furthermore be examined for its unique performance techniques and production requirements. Sign up, put on some comfortable clothes and come to the first class ready to play.&lt;BR&gt; Rehearsals are scheduled throughout Wintersession as needed.</COURSEDESC>

We draw our films from many sources. We draw our readings from a wide range of film journals and establish a shelf of reserve reading material in our library. These sources are incorporated into our discussions and reports. The course requires a class presentation about a film shown and a visual project in film or slides.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXTREME FICTION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Most mainstream fiction is realist in form and narrative in style. These stories generally have a beginning, middle and end, and adhere to a formula that includes rising action, climax, and denouement. The fictions we will examine in this course, however, may have few or none of those qualities:  they may be nonrealist, nonnarrative, postmodern, or fall somewhere between and among these categories, but they provide a counterpoint and challenge to preconceived notions of what a story ought to look like, how it should unfold, and even what relationship the readers should have to the text. We will begin the course with some more traditional stories and then move directly into examining alternative fictions. The readings will likely be selected from texts written by the following authors: Donald Barthelme, Kathy Acker, Italo Calvino, Ishmael Reed, Pamela Zoline, Angela Carter, Ursula LeGuin, Kurt Vonnegut, Stephen Dixon, Michael Wilkerson, Karen Brennan, and others. In addition to the readings, students will be required to give a presentation (with at least one other member of the class), write several responses, and take a final exam.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Since the early Hollywood years, films have played a major role in the way American mainstream culture inscribes Queerness: the many and diverse queer communities, identities, and experiences. This course begins with an examination of earlier representations of Queerness in Hollywood films, tracing Queer cinematic images throughout the early 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.  We will screen Queer films such as Nazimova's &lt;i&gt; Salome (1922) &lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt; The Killing of Sister George (1968) &lt;/i&gt; to analyze their representations of queer identity and examine what they signify to us today.  Our examination of queer film will address the following questions: What is gay or lesbian film?  What is a queer film? What are the ways in which the discourses of race, gender, and sexuality are interrelated and deployed?  The latter half of the course also will examine selected films and documentaries from the new emerging Queer Cinema and a selection of film shorts that are currently running in queer film festivals.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EKPHRASIS AND ITS REVERSE: WRITING FROM ART, ART FROM WRITING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Here's Marcel Proust on his love of art: "Through art alone are we able to emerge from ourselves, to know what another person sees of a universe which is not the same as our own." Instead of seeing one world only, our own, we see that world multiply itself and have at our disposal as many worlds as there are original artists. I want to do something similar in this course: to encourage students to see visual art in terms of writing and writing in terms of visual art, and thus to inspire them in their own studio practice and writing. Students will write creative texts related to their artistic interests or the work of the artists who inspire them and will create art in response to literary texts. We will read various writers (Rilke, Proust, WH Auden, Frank O'Hara - many others) who have been influenced by visual artists, and vice-versa. We will explore questions of narrative, framing, place, autobiography, appropriation, metaphor and symbol, truth and realism, irony, and so on. How can a poem or piece of fiction 'tell the story' of a sculpture or painting? How can a painting 'translate' a passage from Proust, a short story by Kafka or a poem by Elizabeth Bishop? How can it fail, and how are these failures interesting? What is lost in translation between art and literature, and what does this say about the singularity of each medium?  Our overarching aim will be to inspire students through a series of juxtapositions (looking at the similarities between negative space in painting and 'silences' in literature, for example), and to encourage them to engage with and find inspiration in ideas and methods from fields beyond their major.</COURSEDESC>

Texts will include theoretical readings, films, novels, audio recordings, handbills, stereocard slides, postcards and advertisements. Students will be writing frequent response essays, and will produce a presentation--both written and oral-- on one particular aspect/enactment of corporeal display. There will also be a final project which will involve students constructing their own displays.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLAKE AND HOGARTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>William Hogarth (1697-1764) was a practical-minded painter and engraver who sought artistic independence from aristocratic patronage and cultural respect for printmaking as an art.  His greatest innovation was a form of narrative painting and printmaking, marketed to the public at large, in which he presented original stories, essentially visual novels, that challenged the groups that had until then controlled the content and distribution of art, that is, the religious and political establishments. William Blake (1757-1827) was a profoundly impractical painter, poet and engraver who challenged church, state, commerce, and everything else, including time and space, illustrating his own stories and visions as well as a very large proportion of past literary works in ways that reveal their visionary potential.  We will study an array of Hogarth's serial and independent works, as well as several of Blake's "illuminated books," literary and biblical illustrations, and un-illustrated poems.  Students will do independent research and write short papers for all class meetings. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Also offered as LAS C221.

We'll take up these and related questions, and study the rhetorics of legitimation that secure diverse ways of thinking about the increasingly digital present. We will read electronic literature, print sci-fi, film, games, and art, along with cultural and political theory spanning the past half century. Taking a long historical view, we'll address topics ranging from globalization to the aesthetics of code, the newness of new media, technics-out-of-control, gamification of war, technologies of race and gender, digital narratology, and the ideology of computationalism.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>"THIS IS THE WOONASQUATUCKET": STORIES OF A LIVING RIVER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course invites students to engage as researchers and creative artists with the Woonasquatucket River, and with the people in its watershed.  At RISD we see the Woonasquatucket just before it reaches the sea.  But if we turn and follow the river upstream, under the Providence Place Mall, through Valley and Olneyville, to its source in North Smithfield, we begin to recognize the impact the river has had on the state, through massive industrialization in the 19th century to current efforts at environmental and social reclamation.  In this course we will study the river through story.  First, we will research the Woonasquatucket and its watershed, investigating the history, economy, politics, culture, and ecology of the region. Second, we will focus on Oral History, and learn the basics of interviewing and audio recording.  We will gather stories from people whose lives have been entwined with the river, paying particular attention to the expressivity of the human voice, and environmental sounds.  Students will be introduced to a range of contemporary work on sound and voice in poetry.  Finally, students will organize and present their work, and collaborate on a collective project of public interest.  How to collect and represent will remain ethical and aesthetic questions throughout.  Teaching and learning methods will include assigned readings and discussion; print, web and field research; field recording, audio recording and editing; guest speakers; and production/publication.  We will meet once a week for 3 hours, mostly on campus but several times in the field.  When we meet off-campus, travel may take up to an hour each way, in addition to class, and students should plan accordingly.  The course will be taught jointly by an anthropologist and a poet.   &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; This course may be taken for either HPSS or LAS credit.

   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will explore the artistic, cultural, economic, and scientific role of biodiversity in today's society. Using Guyana, a biodiverse English-speaking Caribbean nation located along the northeastern coastline of South America as an example, students will approach the topic of biodiversity from multiple perspectives, including the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and visual arts. Students will spend the first two weeks of Wintersession at RISD, learning about the social history of Guyana; studying its geological, ecological, and biological history; exploring literature and art produced by Guyanese authors and artists; and examining the challenges and opportunities of both conservation and ecotourism in a developing country. Students will then spend two weeks in Guyana where they will explore the bustling capitol city of Georgetown and do fieldwork at the Karanambu Trust House, a biodiversity research and training station located in the sparsely-populated North Rupununi region of the country. The course finishes with a wrap-up session at RISD. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students must also register for co-requisite LAS-E717. &lt;br&gt; Open to Sophomores and Above.&lt;BR&gt; Permission of instructor required&lt;br&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $3,900.00&lt;BR&gt; ***Off-Campus Study***&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MAGICAL REALISM AND THE SOUTH</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The contradiction and excess, the blurring of the real and the imaginary of magical realism have been associated with particular geographical and cultural environments.  We will examine this territorialization of magical realism by comparing the ways in which novels from the "South" -- South America, the Caribbean, Southern U.S. -- formulate the relation of land to individual, familial, and cultural identity.  We will also examine how these "counterrealist" regions reflect on the supposed "rationalism" of the North.  Works to be considered include novels and essays by: Alejo Carpentier, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Octavio Paz, Flannery O'Connor, Toni Morrison, Ana Castillo, William Goyen. &lt;i&gt; Space may be available during Add/Drop for upperclassmen &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS: GENDER AND MEDICINE IN VICTORIAN LITERATURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course focuses upon two interconnected threads in the literature of nineteenth-century Britain-issues of gender and the development of the medical profession. During the Victorian age, the medical field sought to establish itself as a respectable and organized profession, and this effort led to widespread discussions and developments amongst practitioners who attempted to discover the causes and cures of various ailments and perfect their understanding of the human body. As male doctors attempted to establish their position as the sole authority on the human body, women's bodies became a primary focus in medical circles. Victorian medicine portrayed women's bodies as potentially dangerous; they could infect others through disease, go mad, make themselves ill through overwork, die as a result of menstruation, pregnancy, or childbirth, pass on problematic traits to their children, and even become murderous as a result of biological drives. Interestingly, the medical profession also offered an idealized portrait of female health, sometimes believing women to be "born good," describing ill women as beautiful or saintly, and championing the idea that women made the best caregivers for other sick people. In this class, we will read a variety of literature which focuses upon gender and medicine in the Victorian age, drawing upon actual medical articles, newspaper stories, fiction, poetry, memoirs, and even examining pieces of art. We will discuss topics which include (but are not limited to) revivification, invalidism, mesmerism, feminism, the doctor-patient relationship, nursing, reproduction and childbirth, insanity, disability, pseudo-science, masculinity, sexually transmitted diseases, contagion, and psychiatry. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE LIVES OF OBJECTS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>A dancing table, a blind glass, a tender button. This course examines how modern representations of the inanimate world speak to questions concerning human life, human rights, and the shape of desire, by tracing industrialization?s effects through the horrifying recognition that we, too, have become thing-like. While the human/inhuman distinction has remained a perennial interest to artists, writers, political economists, anthropologists, and philosophers, such an obsession intensified with the rise of industrial capitalism in the early 19th century. Using things as a lens, we will cover such topics as fetishism, reification, the uncanny, and the art-object in order to pursue the strange lives that objects assume in the modern imaginary. At the same time, we will consider how discussions of thingness reflect on systems of exploitation, including slavery, colonialism, and human trafficking. We will explore the processes of producing, collecting, consuming, exchanging as they are described in 19th and 20th century literature, film, and political discourse in order to ask the following: What is the difference between a thing, an object, and a commodity? How have human subjects come to be constituted by the inanimate world around them? How do these narratives of possession-of being possessed by possessions-approach something stranger than the history of a culture of consumption? As a way of answering some of these questions, we will turn to important thinkers and artists on these topics, which will likely include: Karl Marx, Georg Lukacs, Sigmund Freud, Martin Heidegger, Gertrude Stein, Joseph Cornell, Nathaniel West, Charlie Chaplin, Georges Perec, Ralph Ellison, Muriel Spark, Kazuo Ishiguro, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnes Varda, Donna Harraway, Susan Stewart, and A.M.

Americans frequently take to the roads to find themselves, but how does the journey help shape our identities? &lt;BR&gt;  This course will examine a variety of twentieth century road trip narratives (books and films) to understand how the road teaches us what it means to be American.  We will give particular consideration to how gender, age, class, race, and ethnic identity might influence one's experience of the road, and, conversely, we will look at how the mythology of the road has affected our collective understanding of those categories.  Other topics to be addressed include, American regionalism, the "outsider's" view of America and, of course, America's love for the automobile.  Our travel guides: Walt Whitman, Jack Kerouac, Eddy Harris, Henry Miller, John Steinbeck, William Least Heat-Moon, Diana Hume, and John Krakauer.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomores and above.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops the different levels of dexterity and control in the construction of architectural drawing. The pedagogy allows for students to build a basic understanding of orthographic drawing typologies and traditional drawing methods while preparing them for more complex hybridized drawing methods. A parallel segment of the course addresses freehand representation, developing observation and translation tools necessary to design. Through these multiple approaches, drawing is developed as a tool to transform conceptual ideas into tangible form. The class will be taught as a series of lectures that discuss both why and how we draw accompanied by skill building workshops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*SRI LANKA: NORTHERN VISIONS SRI LANKA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This travel course will explore the rich architectural, landscape and artisan traditions of the island nation of Sri Lanka. Located just 22 miles across the Palk Strait from the southeastern coast of India, the island has a long and rich history of settlement dating back to at least the 6th C BCE. People from West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Portugal, the Netherlands and England have arrived, conquered and stayed, leaving an elaborate tapestry of artistic traditions, religions and customs.&lt;BR&gt;  We will visit the Buddhist stupas and lakes of Anuradhapura, ancient capital of the Kingdom of Sri Lanka, dating to the late 4th C BCE, and the Buddhist temples of Kandy, last capital of independent Sri Lanka founded in the 14th C and nestled in the central highlands. There we will explore the 19th-early 20th C hillside homes and verdant tea plantations of the British colonizers and the ancient stone rainwater harvesting tanks and cascading irrigation systems. We will visit the Portuguese Fort and Dutch city of Galle on the southern coast and study works of the great Sri Lankan modern architect Geoffrey Bawa and his disciples in the capital Colombo and across the southern parts of the island. En route we will visit village textile cooperatives and artisan cottage industries to see how these traditions are being kept alive and how they are part of larger strategies aimed at social and economic empowerment.&lt;BR&gt;  The goal of the course is to create an annotated visual documentation of ancient through contemporary architectural, landscape and artisan practices in Sri Lanka. These will include siting strategies, material and structural studies, climate control and resource management systems, spatial layouts and use patterns, and artisan processes. The entire Wintersession period will be spent in Sri Lanka with regular work sessions for compilation of data and observations built into the trip. &lt;BR&gt;  Note: This course is part of a multi-year RISD involvement with Sri Lanka through DESINE-Lab@RISD. The larger effort focuses on the northern region of the island and the reconstruction and refugee resettlement process following the country's three-decade civil war. While the material produced in the course is a critical component of the larger effort and there will be DESINE-Lab members running workshops in conflict-impacted areas in the weeks prior to Wintersession, this travel course will NOT be going to the north of the country.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Open to Sophomores and Above. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Travel Cost: $571.00; Airfare not included&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar introduces a spectrum of research methodologies meaningful to design disciplines focusing on the intersection of the human, built and natural worlds - approaches stemming for the social sciences, environmental sciences, and design practice.  Students will work through a variety of written and visual means to explore differences between, and uses of, quantitative and qualitative data collection, analysis, interpretation, and application.  Methods to be explored include Grounded Theory, Phenomenological Inquiry, Participatory approaches, Ethnography, Comparative approaches, Case Study, Postmodern Critical Theory, Systems Theory, survey, narrative, typologies, experimentation, modeling, matrices, mapping, design as research, and social and environmental impact assessment and evaluation.  Special attention will be paid to issues of causality, generalization, values and ethics.  &lt;BR&gt;  The class will be organized around a set of related issues water, ground and poverty, with a focus on the city of Providence.  There will be two phases of research with the class participants determining the over-riding research question. Each phase will involve teamwork where teams will utilize different research methodologies to examine the same basic question, and will include written and visual documentation, analysis and interpretation.  At the end of each phase, students will explore the differences between the various methodologies and their outcomes and discuss when and how certain approaches and their combination may be more or less effective as part of the practice, critique and scholarship of design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This graduate seminar meets two days a week, three hours each.  It is required for all first-year students in Landscape Architecture. &lt;BR&gt; Open to Graduate Level only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>What do these words mean and what is their relationship to each other in the architectural design disciplines? Each word is packed with complex and evolving meanings that reflect the state of human knowledge about the environments in which we live and in which we intervene. Each word reflects our understanding of systems, physical, cultural and social, biotic and abiotic, as well as our aspirations to conserve, restore, or reshape those systems. Each word is ubiquitous in the contemporary quest to construct a sustainable, resilient future.  But do we really understand what they mean? Are they critically interdependent or can they be considered separately?&lt;br&gt; This studio will examine these questions with the twin objectives of establishing an evolving and dynamic understanding of the terms and generating working methods that respond to the complexities of scale encountered in the landscape. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN SYSTEMS STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This final core studio stresses large-scale design and planning issues, complex sites, and urban conditions. The city is a living organism which evolves in a particular locale with a particular form due to a combination of environmental and cultural factors. These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux. This studio will explore these systems and the complex issues at play in our urban areas and the potential for positive change. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $210.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RESEARCH METHODS FOR DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This seminar introduces a spectrum of research methodologies meaningful to design disciplines focusing on the intersection of the human, built and natural worlds - approaches stemming for the social sciences, environmental sciences, and design practice.  Students will work through a variety of written and visual means to explore differences between, and uses of, quantitative and qualitative data collection, analysis, interpretation, and application.  Methods to be explored include Grounded Theory, Phenomenological Inquiry, Participatory approaches, Ethnography, Comparative approaches, Case Study, Postmodern Critical Theory, Systems Theory, survey, narrative, typologies, experimentation, modeling, matrices, mapping, design as research, and social and environmental impact assessment and evaluation.  Special attention will be paid to issues of causality, generalization, values and ethics.  &lt;BR&gt;  The class will be organized around a set of related issues water, ground and poverty, with a focus on the city of Providence.  There will be two phases of research with the class participants determining the over-riding research question. Each phase will involve teamwork where teams will utilize different research methodologies to examine the same basic question, and will include written and visual documentation, analysis and interpretation.  At the end of each phase, students will explore the differences between the various methodologies and their outcomes and discuss when and how certain approaches and their combination may be more or less effective as part of the practice, critique and scholarship of design.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt; This graduate seminar meets two days a week, three hours each.  It is required for all first-year students in Landscape Architecture. &lt;BR&gt; Open to Graduate Level only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course develops the different levels of dexterity and control in the construction of architectural drawing. The pedagogy allows for students to build a basic understanding of orthographic drawing typologies and traditional drawing methods while preparing them for more complex hybridized drawing methods. A parallel segment of the course addresses freehand representation, developing observation and translation tools necessary to design. Through these multiple approaches, drawing is developed as a tool to transform conceptual ideas into tangible form. The class will be taught as a series of lectures that discuss both why and how we draw accompanied by skill building workshops. &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration; Open to non-majors by permission of Instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>TRANSLATING THE MIND'S EYE: 3D PERSPECTIVE HAND DRAWING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>"The perspective drawing, invented in the Renaissance when its optical principles were initially understood, triggered revolution [.] the perspective is difficult to construct but easy to comprehend, since it represents form and space as they are actually seen." As the human eye visualizes objects through three point perspectives, it is imperative for students working in design to understand how to represent their ideas clearly in a two dimensional plane. Students will start the course off by drawing a simple dice and then progress to more advanced drawings. &lt;BR&gt;  We begin with the dice, as the foundations for its accurate representation are easily translatable to many objects. It integrates two principle shapes that form the basis with which one is able able to extrapolate many objects and forms: the cylinder and rectangular prism. &lt;BR&gt;  This class is focused on helping students to understand and better visualize three-dimensional spaces, as well as being able to translate them onto a two dimensional plane.  This class is specifically geared towards students who want a better understanding of how to use a measured plan to draw a three dimensional perspective.  Students who will benefit from this class will have little to no background in technical architectural or landscape drawing. In week one of the course, students will be asked to fill out a form outlining their weaknesses and strengths in drawing. Students will then be assigned to draw a dice in perspective. This simple object will allow the instructors to use the information from their self-evaluations and dice drawings to cater future assignments for the class. In section two of the course, students will be able to apply the logic of the dice drawing, learned in section one, to a studio project or to future portfolio pieces. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $100.00</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>"THE PLACE" - MAPPING EMOTIONS IN LANDSCAPE AND FILM</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC> Landscape is not just the physical environment that we live in, it is closely connected to our own psychological world. When we walk through a landscape, we are not only moving physically, but also mentally. The emotions that we experience in a landscape color our  understanding of that place and, often, offer us fresh insights of ourselves. Film is a medium that can capture and express psychological states very successfully. The methods used in film share much in common with methods of landscape design; one's view is controlled and exploited for effect, movement is choreographed through sequentially framed scenes, light and shadow are modulated to enhance or hide information or to change the feeling of the scene, and sound is used to layer additional qualities of mood and feeling. There are also differences, for example, landscape architecture maps experiences through processes of diagramming that anticipate temporal changes and diverse movement patterns. In this class, we will look at how methods from these two disciplines can be used to create rich emotional experiences in a specific outdoor space.  Each student will make a short film or video about a place of their choosing in Providence. Using their film as a starting point, students will use the methodological languages of film and landscape architecture to deign a proposal for an environmental intervention to be inserted into the original space. This course is also a testing field for students to observe and study how people engage with their surroundings on both physical and psychological layers, in both films and landscape; and get a much broader and richer understanding of landscape. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Materials Cost: $200.00   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>URBAN SYSTEMS STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This final core studio stresses large-scale design and planning issues, complex sites, and urban conditions. The city is a living organism which evolves in a particular locale with a particular form due to a combination of environmental and cultural factors. These factors, the forces they represent and the material results of their interaction form, in their interrelated state, what can be called "urban systems." The many forces at play within cities-social, cultural, economic, ideological, ecological, infra structural, morphological and visual-combine in various ways to created both an identifiable urban realm and the many sub zones within this. Yet, none of these factors is static and unchanging; and, as a result, urban systems, urban dynamics, and urban identity are likewise in a continuous state of flux. This studio will explore these systems and the complex issues at play in our urban areas and the potential for positive change. &lt;br&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $210.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The advanced course studies multimedia drawing through the use of freehand and computer drawing. It explores the possibilities with the material and content of two dimensional expression. The class encourages greater connections with the design studios by testing and reevaluating design work through the lens of phenomenology and seriality. Scale and composition are emphasized in the detailed and constructed drawings that are required in class.  Individual investigations are developed throughout this advanced course to encourage a way of making marks that connect with the various modes of exploration in their studio work.&lt;br&gt; Estimated Cost of Materials: $225.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; LDAR majors only&lt;br&gt; Registration by Landscape Architecture Design department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar engages the rich dialogue that occurs between digital space and manual space. It will focus on independent lines of investigation exploring drawings that generate and communicate three dimensional experiences that transform over time. We will be using multiple technologies including photography, scanning, collage, photoshop, and sketchup, overlapped with direct actions taken upon the drawing surface. The focus throughout the spring will be the development of a set of drawings that utilizes the many tools of drawing from digital media to hand drawing.&lt;BR&gt; An essential ingredient in the course involves the Medium. While we will discuss "medium" as it relates to the "message" (MacLuhan), we will also medium within themes of workflow production and the experimentation process, and the conveyance of the artists' intent. Another essential ingredient is Process, (or evidence of a process). This seminar is an opportunity to advance theoretical and experimental expressions of your RISD trajectory. Lastly, Corroboration as a separate theme will highlight the expected mutual reinforcement that takes place between visceral representation and quantitative infographic overlays.&lt;BR&gt;  Estimated Cost of Materials: $250.00 &lt;br&gt;&lt;I&gt;Major Elective; Open to ARCH and LDAR majors; Open to others by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CRITICAL CURATING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The history of painting and the trajectory of radical exhibition models in the post-war period have always seemed divergent, even antithetical: the former pursued autonomy, then, more recently, returned to narrative and figuration, while the latter took cue, both morphologically and discursively, from installation, sited, and conceptual art. This course counters such assumptions by examining post-war painting in tandem with key moments in curating (eg. Alanna Heiss' PS1; Okwui Enwezor's Documenta XI; Jerome Sans and Nicolas Bourriaud's Palais de Tokyo; and Dan Cameron's Prospect 1). The course's second half, at once more speculative and hands on, uses the Painting Gallery as a test site for mounting an exhibition or exhibitions, with emphasis on the peculiarities that painting - bounded, rectilinear, and flat - presents. Readings to include Bruce Altschuler, Julie Ault, Thomas Crow, Thierry de Duve, Hal Foster, Brian O'Doherty and others.&lt;br&gt; The course has a fee for two field trips to New York.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Senior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SENIOR HONORS INTERDISCIPLINARY CRITIQUE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This is a course in which first-semester seniors who have already demonstrated unusual commitment, ambition and initiative within their majors will pursue and discuss independent work in a setting that reflects, as closely as possible, the interdisciplinary conversation that actually takes place around advanced art practice today. The course is intended to allow those working within medium-specific vocabularies to test how their work will make meaning in an art world in which a variety of disciplinary histories and conventions coexist, clash, and inform one another, as well as to provide an opportunity for students whose work bridges two or more disciplines (or involves performance/new genres/post-studio approaches) to learn from one another and from faculty capable of addressing all of these sorts of practices. This is a demanding critique course with additional seminar components (readings, screenings, discussions, slide presentations, etc.), and as such students can expect a workload equivalent to a core studio requirement within their major.&lt;br&gt;  Acceptance into the course will be based on a GPA of 3.25 or greater as well as the recommendation of faculty and department heads from the student's major and on review of previous work. Candidates will be identified in discussions between the instructor and department heads during the preceding spring semester. Successful completion of ARTH-H490/PAINT-4507 (Contemporary Art &amp; its Discourses) or equivalent coursework is a prerequisite, ensuring students have a shared understanding of the art historical context for interdisciplinary. The maximum enrollment is limited to seminar-size (c. 15 students) in order to provide sufficient attention to each student's work in group and individual critiques while still allowing for seminar-style discussions.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES IN PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course would address many practical issues to do with becoming a professional artist after graduation. Some of these issues are: the commercial gallery, the not-for-profit gallery, museums, graduate programs, auction houses, grants, documentation of work, archival storage of work and restoration of artwork. Professionals from the gallery, museum and other fields will be invited to the class to share their expertise with the student. Artists will be invited to talk about their professional experiences. It is a seminar class addressed particularly to the senior painting student.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Painting majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Non-majors by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"Three Critics" will offer graduate students the opportunity to get inside the art critic's head and learn how writers think about the visual. Students will be exposed to a wide range of viewpoints and discourse on contemporary art issues as defined by the interests of three different, practicing critics. Each critic will become part of the RISD community for approximately one month, conducting 3 sessions on campus and one in New York or Boston. On-campus meetings will consist of lectures, reading and writing assignments, group critiques and one-on-one studio visits. Off-campus trips will include visits to museums, galleries and artist studios. Small groups of students will be expected to lead several classes. Outside coursework and full participation in class discussion required for successful completion.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major requirement&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Painting department, course not available via web registration&lt;br&gt; Requirement for second-year graduate Painting graduate students.

   <COURSETITLE>MEANING IN THE MEDIUM OF PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This first-year graduate seminar approaches painting as a technical skill, a historical practice and an intellectual project. Weekly sessions begin with group discussions of key readings about recent painting. Readings are organized in three sections. The first looks backward, to the problem of medium that preoccupied modernist painting and, residually, contemporary practices until the 1980s. The second section looks at two phenomena, the academy and the art market, and their effect on how painting is produced, disseminated, discussed and received. The third, the most speculative, looks laterally at a range of contemporary practices from the 1990s to the present.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FOCUS: MATERIAL EXPLORATIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Working with a wide array of materials, different approaches to physicality and surface, and inventive methods of deploying color other than by brush, this "painting" course will make works that occupy the space of the wall familiar to painting -- but not its most traditional conventions.  With a deep engagement in process and informed by readings and targeted artists and art historical movements, students will explore materiality and visual culture. Shopping for "art supplies" will take place as much at Home Depot as at Utrecht. Employing the recycled and trash, the found and gathered, and the manufactured and the natural, the art made will be critiqued for both presence and meaning.  From duct tape to cotton balls soaked in acrylic paint -- one finds context, from varying thicknesses of rope dipped in polymer mediums to woven plastic shopping bags -- one finds structure, and from paint squirted from plastic ketchup bottles to fake fur -- one finds attitude.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course open to all majors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

An historical and cultural perspective will be introduced to inform ongoing color studies executed in the studio. Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Open to all majors&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASE STUDIES:CONTEMPORARY ART</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This intensive course is designed to immerse students in select, salient debates impacting the direction and parameters of contemporary painting. The goal is not only to introduce and familiarize, but also to collectively and actively generate possibilities for and within the medium. Six overlapping nodes, or case studies, each accompanied by readings and a list of relevant artists, guide our investigation: Endings and Beginnings, Monochromania, Photoshop Killed the Photographer Killed the Painter, Market Mechanisms (and Academic Exercises), Regional Painting, and Narrative. When possible, current exhibitions will be discussed.  The course will be seminar style sessions interspersed with critique and discussion of the work of enrolled students.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major elective, Painting seniors only&lt;/i&gt;  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>MONSTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will investigate cultural traditions of the "monster", broadly defined as an entity of horrific other-ness. Monsters can be microscopic or gigantic, savage or pathetic, infectious or predacious.  Monsters of all sorts, real and imagined, continue to invade our lives. Their narrative depiction has developed culturally as a metaphorical exploration of our deepest fears. tDuring the class our interest will be in a three dimensional communication and transcription of monster related imagery.  While working with a variety of sculptural materials we will stimulate imagination through films, slides, books and articles.  We will distill these influences into our own themes, grandiose, frightening and seductive.  Our goal will be to forge connections between themes of fear from the distant, and those of our present lives.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FOCUS:GO FIGURE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will investigate various approaches to representing the figure in contemporary art. Such things as the historical, psychological and narrative implications of using a human form in a work of art will be emphasized. There will be an exploration of studio-based strategies that will include working from observation and using mediated imagery such as film stills and photography.  Students will start with in-class assignments working from a model in an interior that will culminate in a large-scale project that investigates the broader interpretation of figuration. Students will be challenged in technical, formal and conceptual approaches to creating a figurative work of art. While technical instruction will be focused primarily on painting, drawings and collage, students will be encouraged to also work in the media of their choice. In-class assignments will be supplemented with PowerPoint presentations as well as film and video screenings, reading materials, and critiques.  &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING FROM OBSERVATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a comprehensive introduction to painting. It will be a marathon of daily painting assignments designed to develop confidence and experience with representational painting. We will examine historical and contemporary trends and paint from life models and photo sources. Fundamental techniques for basic ground preparation, oil painting mediums and direct as well as indirect processes will be taught. Representational painting will be the primary focus but experiences in abstract painting will also be encouraged. We will learn abstract principles that organize composition, depict spatial illusion and describe form while developing a shared language in critiques. No prior painting experience is required and Foundation students considering painting as their major are encouraged to enroll, as well as majors from other departments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;i&gt; Students are advised not to take a second Wintersession course because of the commitment of time this course will require.&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

An historical and cultural perspective will be introduced to inform ongoing color studies executed in the studio. Students will acquire the vocabulary to articulate color phenomena and the means to exploit the expressive potential of color in their work. Color studies will be principally created with gouache, and a variety of other materials and means will also be explored. Lectures, demonstrations, and museum visits will supplement studio work.  A short research paper is required.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective; Open to all majors&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This seminar course will introduce students to the complex and growing terrain of contemporary South Asian art via three key intersecting areas of inquiry: drawing, narrative, and materiality as explored by contemporary artists working in the South Asian subcontinent and diaspora. Through critically engaged discussion, readings, screenings, and talks, we will examine a wide range of contemporary art practices, including comic and graphic novel based works, site-specific installation, street art, and the role of materiality and process in contemporary South Asian art practice. Alongside an in-depth investigation of specific artists and their practices, we will also situate these works within key theoretical texts and exhibitions generated in the field, in order to shed light on the social, political, and art-historical discourses in which they are situated, and their impact on the global contemporary art scene.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Junior and Above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The main objective of this course will focus on the creation of spaces, both figurative and physical, that produce unprecedented realms for acts of performativity. Modern histories of object making and exhibitions (painting, sculpture and installation) and the trajectory of performance have been intricately linked in scholarship and exhibitions. From the collaborations of the Cabaret Voltaire, Rauschenberg/Cage/Cunningham, to directors like Robert Wilson and Richard Foreman to the recent work of Cindy Sherman, the paintings of R.H. Quaytman and the fluid installations Lucie Mackenzie, strategies of object making have coalesced with performance in formality and concept. This convergence has challenged conventional ideas of theatricality and theatre design. This course will examine these dynamic histories and scholarship, and will analyze related exhibitions such as Tate Modern's chronicle A Bigger Splash, Painting After Performance, in 2012-13, which explored the cross pollination between painting in tandem with key moments in performativity. We will examine how this Avant guard linage has influenced and countered conventional productions, and we will seek to design and implement scenarios and spaces contemporaneous to this investigation. The course encourages research and writing as well hands on investigations through the making of objects and performance actions. We will thoroughly examine the concept, design and implementation of tableaux; generating visual scenes that grasp yet challenge familiar theatrical constructs whilst creating performances within these constructs culminating in a collaborative performance production. Throughout the course we will explore documentation as a vehicle for implementing various mediated redelivery systems. We will establish our own Vimeo page for public access to works created during the course as well as an ongoing Internet presence. Using the Tap Room for performances and a drawing studio Memorial hall 312 as tests site for mounting performances and exhibitions, with emphasis on finding new methodologies and delivery systems for this ongoing dialog. The course will culminate play (TDB) presented collaboratively for the entire RISD community in one of the auditoriums.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Deposit:  $120&lt;br&gt; Elective; Junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The main objective of this course will focus on the creation of spaces, both figurative and physical, that produce unprecedented realms for acts of performativity. Modern histories of object making and exhibitions (painting, sculpture and installation) and the trajectory of performance have been intricately linked in scholarship and exhibitions. From the collaborations of the Cabaret Voltaire, Rauschenberg/Cage/Cunningham, to directors like Robert Wilson and Richard Foreman to the recent work of Cindy Sherman, the paintings of R.H. Quaytman and the fluid installations Lucie Mackenzie, strategies of object making have coalesced with performance in formality and concept. This convergence has challenged conventional ideas of theatricality and theatre design. This course will examine these dynamic histories and scholarship, and will analyze related exhibitions such as Tate Modern's chronicle A Bigger Splash, Painting After Performance, in 2012-13, which explored the cross pollination between painting in tandem with key moments in performativity. We will examine how this Avant guard linage has influenced and countered conventional productions, and we will seek to design and implement scenarios and spaces contemporaneous to this investigation. The course encourages research and writing as well hands on investigations through the making of objects and performance actions. We will thoroughly examine the concept, design and implementation of tableaux; generating visual scenes that grasp yet challenge familiar theatrical constructs whilst creating performances within these constructs culminating in a collaborative performance production. Throughout the course we will explore documentation as a vehicle for implementing various mediated redelivery systems. We will establish our own Vimeo page for public access to works created during the course as well as an ongoing Internet presence. Using the Tap Room for performances and a drawing studio Memorial hall 312 as tests site for mounting performances and exhibitions, with emphasis on finding new methodologies and delivery systems for this ongoing dialog. The course will culminate play (TDB) presented collaboratively for the entire RISD community in one of the auditoriums.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Deposit:  $120&lt;br&gt; Elective; Junior and above&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PROFESSIONAL PRACTICES IN PAINTING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course would address many practical issues to do with becoming a professional artist after graduation. Some of these issues are: the commercial gallery, the not-for-profit gallery, museums, graduate programs, auction houses, grants, documentation of work, archival storage of work and restoration of artwork. Professionals from the gallery, museum and other fields will be invited to the class to share their expertise with the student. Artists will be invited to talk about their professional experiences. It is a seminar class addressed particularly to the senior painting student.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Painting majors only&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Non-majors by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>ABSTRACT PAINTING: ATTITUDES AND ACTIONS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Our conceptions of abstract painting may lie in a romantic notion of expressionism, the lofty spirituality of intuitive painters, or a cold calculated sense of execution found in minimalism. We may even feel that in today's pluralistic age of art making that abstraction may only serve the whims of dealers and collectors in the market. I would argue that the practice of abstract painting can be extremely radical, allowing for endless possibilities and manifestations of images through the act of painting. Sustaining this practice expands the mind and material understanding of the maker. &lt;BR&gt; This course is for the student looking for a hands on investigation into the methods and material practices of abstraction. We will focus on the tools, techniques, and conceptual methods employed by abstract painters through time to build a foundation for beginning a new body of abstract work, or enhancing a student's practice already in motion. Attitudes and Actions could easily stand for motives and techniques, as we will supplement our studio work with readings from artist interviews, critics, and art historians from the past and present. We will learn how these artists approached their work and how we can apply their lessons to our own work without simply stealing their pictorial devices for our own use. We discuss the work of seminal abstractionist such as Juan Miro, Arshile Gorky, Richard Diebenkorn, Cy Twombly, Willem DeKooning, Philip Guston, Amy Sillman, Bill Jensen, Charlene von Heyl, Robert Gober, and Per Kirkeby. As we progress we will have an open dialogue allowing for all types of fuel for speculation of abstract painting, including poetry, film, philosophy, new media, etc.&lt;BR&gt; This course will be divided into three sections dealing with three time periods of abstraction, to give structure to the readings and assignments. These include Past forms of Abstraction(Modernism and it's offshoots), Contemporary forms of Abstraction, and finally Speculative forms of Abstraction. Slide lectures and readings will accompany each section.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>SUBVERTING THE NUDE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In Subverting the Nude, we will explore the complexities of the meanings of "nude" and "naked" within painting. We'll inquire about what it means to be a subject or an object, and how to depict these notions on canvas. Subverting the Nude will allow students to challenge traditional representations of figurative painting through depictions of human, animal, and hybrid bodies. We will begin by painting from a model while studying basic human anatomy. Students will then advance beyond conventional figure painting practices into creating informed works that take influence from the body. Students will be encouraged to not only challenge the painted figure, but the history of nude painting itself. Thus, "painting" will not necessarily be restricted to paint on canvas. The format of this course will be influenced by feminist pedagogy, apparent through a style of alternative critique based on Critical Response Process by Liz Lerman. This process is valued as an empowering and non-threatening feedback system. Readings will be based upon criticalities of traditional painting, the objectification of women and animals, and a collaged painting aesthetic.  </COURSEDESC>

The course will study and move from the traditional to the conceptual to allow for an adequate understanding of the history of drawing and its constant change. The role of the course is to empower students in the studio by giving them a concrete and critical overview of the variety of techniques and methods of conveying and conceptualizing ideas through a flexible and malleable medium.  </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>RELIEF.PAINTING.</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is going to focus on using 'relief' in painting, or the space between 2D and 3D, to facilitate invention and transformation. While there is a rich history of using paint to enhance relief sculpture, there seems to be room for further investigating the use of relief to transform painting. Making three-dimensional decisions for an idea typically expressed in two-dimensions will allow students to rethink the context of their work in relationship to the physical index they create. With the 'relief' in mind, we will examine the following four concepts: relief as obstruction, relief as transformer, relief as pictorial, and relief as reference. &lt;BR&gt; In addition, this studio course will reexamine the parameters of painting to facilitate the understanding of using materials as a means to a new beginning, or a generative starting point, rather than a means to an end. We will use a wide range of materials traditionally used in sculpture and construction, to investigate 'relief' painting, as a type of expanded drawing, where 2D, 3D, and process collide to create meaning. Through weekly demos, samples, slide presentations, and videos, we will revisit historical models in an effort to better understand how and why relief has been used in the past and the possibilities it has for the future. Emphasis will be placed on making. For the final class each student will be expected to bring in all of their artwork from the class to present not as a finished product, but more of as a body of experiments. All students will be required to document their making process and work.</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>EXTRACTING THE REAL: PAINTING AND REPRESENTATION</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>How have systems of representation and various image-making devices through which we make meaning changed in condition since the onset of the digital and mass image production? Extracting the Real: Painting and Representation will explore various historical approaches to representation within the context and history of painting. We will investigate what representation is within the medium of painting, what some of the basic devices for representation are, why they are used, and how these systems can serve the purposes of an artist's project to generate meaning in various ways. The course will initially begin with painting directly from life - perhaps the most classical, exemplary standard technology for representation - and will move to consider how other 19th and 20th Century technologies of mimesis - photography/film and other forms of indexical mark making - have functioned to change, complicate, or revise the ways images are both created and received. How might these various multi-media approaches to representation be considered as painting? Are the technologies for mediation that are thought of as belonging to photography and film in fact owed to painting? What are the conditions particular to the hand painted mark as opposed to the photographic and/or indexical one and where might the binary become blurry? How does each of these approaches to representation and image-making function differently to define content? Open-ended assignments will prompt students to experiment with and/or reexamine a few of the predominant historical approaches to representation through the frame of painting, and critiques will further our dialogue around an understanding of what representation is and how it functions. Readings will be assigned to assist in the development of this dialogue. The course will culminate in individual projects based on a system (or combination of systems) of representation of the students' invention. In tandem to this final project, students will also create a brief, written definition of their individual understanding of what representation is, through the lens of painting, as a reflection on the course.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>PAINTING ABSTRACT REALITIES: THINKING ABOUT TODAY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course aims to think of abstraction not as a synonym of modernism but as a contemporary practice. The course will focus on building a foundation on abstract painting by using themes that respond to nature (anatomy, landscape, etc.) and themes that respond to culture (architecture, language, technology, etc.) Throughout the course, we will work with a variety of theatrical sets, photographs and 3D models that embody the themes mentioned above. The student will be asked to explore the presented reality and develop a visual language by abstracting, completing or creating an altered narrative. Presentations and readings will serve as an instrument to understand not only the formal aspects of paintings but also, its sociopolitical and cultural connections. This course will generate a body of work that portrays the student's interests and curiosities about the present day and abstract art. A final project will complete the course.   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING IN 3-D SPACE</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is a laboratory sited at the crossroads where drawing and the physical world overlap, perform, and deploy one another. Logistically speaking, assignments will address the challenges implicit in making work beyond the rectangle of the page. We will engage this subject through a combination of studio-based assignments, readings, and in-class discussions and critiques. In specific terms, we will be working through a series of studio-based assignments that will aid us in our interrogation and engagement of the mimetic, sublime, and theatrical notions of space. Together we will arrive at an understanding of these terms by using Miwon Kwon's text "Promiscuity of Space: Some Thoughts on Jessica Stockholder's Scenographic Compositions" as a roadmap for our inquiries. Kwon's essay presents an alternative narrative to the claims made by Rosalind Krauss in her influential text Sculpture in the Expanded Field. In Kwon's essay there is a prompt to investigate connections between Krauss' "Expanded Field of Sculpture" and the 'field' of Color Field paintings. This course takes the possibility of a connection between these spatial locations to its logical conclusion via the medium and activity of drawing in 3-D space. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"For there is no folly of the beast of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men." - Herman Melville, Moby Dick  &lt;BR&gt;  Located just 35 minutes east of RISD, the New Bedford Whaling Museum offers a fascinating and often disturbing perspective on the emergence of modernity along side the systematic hunting and harvesting of whales to the brink of extinction.  Through several visits to the museum this course asks students to reflect upon and interpret a wide range of interrelated subjects including folk art, nautical culture, colonial politics, marine biology and museum display. With additional access to museum archives students address these topics through research-based projects that employ drawing, painting, and installation with particular attention to contextualizing within differing modes of museum display.  &lt;BR&gt;  The New Bedford Whaling museum boasts a rich collection of unique and unusual artifacts that together issue a cautionary tale by asking visitors to contemplate the tenuous line between pursuit of profit and the destruction of that which we hold most sacred. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>A MYRIAD MARGINALIA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This semester course will be connected to the residency in the RISD Museum of the Raqs Media Collective, New Delhi-based artist provocateurs.  As part of this experimental course students will explore manuscript marginalia and develop a body of artistic, literary, philosophical, and narrative resources that culminate in an experimental manuscript.  &lt;BR&gt;  "We may all be on the same page, but no one is at the center. The margin is everywhere."   -Raqs Media Collective &lt;BR&gt;   With the rapid dissolution of any pretense of a single pivotal meta-text that enables a reading of the world in terms of stable centers and peripheries, marginalia - acts of writing and drawing on the margin - take on a new significance.   &lt;BR&gt; 'A Myriad Marginalia' is an experimental studio designed by the Raqs Media Collective, drawing on conversation, collective annotation and the gathering of materials in order to transform the practice of the thinking artist. &lt;BR&gt;   The margin has its own force-field. Medieval illuminated manuscripts come alive at the margins. "Marginalists" (generally apprentices to scribes and illustrators) inscribe figures and tropes embodying profane wisdom, popular proverbs, burlesque figures, chimerical creatures, and fantastical or allegorical allusions that construct a counter-narrative to the main body of a master text. Sometimes, this is where the new ideas that change everything make their first appearance. &lt;BR&gt;   During their time at RISD, Raqs will maintain a studio dedicated to the exploration of marginalia in the wake of the dissolution of the power of any central codex. The studio will cultivate the specific kind of attentiveness necessary to pursue and parse the marginal. In their time at the studio, Raqs will also work on the making of what they call a 'myriad marginal manuscript' - an artistic work that indexes their what they consider to be their ongoing entanglement with the seven billion people of the planet. In the course of doing this, they will develop (with students) a body of artistic, literary, philosophical and narrative resources that enable a rich and growing conversation across all media, on the vistas opened out by standing on the margin. &lt;BR&gt;   Class trips in planning will include the Queens Museum for a guided tour of the ground-breaking exhibition After Midnight: Indian Modernism To Contemporary India 1947/ 1997 with artist Suddhabrata Sengupta. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt; Junior and above &lt;br&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOBOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is not far fetched to think of our times as the Golden Age of the photobook. Never before have there been that many makers of photobooks, ranging from major publishers to individual artists producing their own photobooks "on demand." This development is both a reaction to and a consequence of new - digital - technologies, which have vastly lowered the barrier that stands between a photographer and her/his own photobook. As a consequence, there now is a small industry dedicated solely to photobooks, a development jump-started by the success of Martin Parr and Gerry Badger's two-volume The Photobook: A History. &lt;BR&gt; The purpose of this course is twofold. First, it introduce students to the photobook, its role and purpose, and its history. Part of the historical survey will be to study well-known or important photobooks to see how they operate. Readings will be given to explore, text, sequencing and concept. Students will use their on going studio work to complete assignments to establish photo book design and sequencing skills. Each student will complete a photobook for the class final project. There will be an assignment designed to help produce a digital proof but the final book will be hand printed and bound at a custom binder. Distribution of the photobook and self-publishing will be explored in depth.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;This is a laptop based class.

   <COURSEDESC>The lines between still and time-based media are blurring in the digital era. New cameras offer both modes of image capture and image files are infinitely malleable. This course follows Issues &amp; Image I and introduces students to a wide range of critical issues and expressive approaches in time-based (lens-based) work, concentrating on work of the past two decades. Course time will be divided among multimedia lectures, group discussions, visiting artists/curators, in-class projects, and student presentations. Reading and writing assignments will introduce students to the concepts and language of time-based work. Class lectures will expose them to a large range of styles, methods, genres and content concerns. Practical assignments (including a collaboratively-produced videotape, individually edited and presented to the class) will allow students to put theory into practice and understand in a low-tech, hands-on way the expressive possibilities of time-based work. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; Registration by Photography department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;   </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This final course in the required technical series for majors emphasizes the potentials of image-making untethered from a paper support. With the advent of digital image capture, the photograph, as digital data, has become an infinitely malleable unit of meaning that can be reconstituted to form sequences and transformations. Not only can it be a still print-object, but it can be a projection of light on any number of surfaces, an informational component in a screen-based narrative, or one visual element among many in an environmental installation. Students will explore the dynamic intersections between moving and still; timeless and time-driven; simultaneous and sequential imaging. They will learn how to move data fluidly among different programs and to work from a broader "systems-level" perspective - a necessity in the context of today's rapidly changing software platforms.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major requirement&lt;br&gt; May be taken concurrently with PHOTO 5311&lt;br&gt; Permission of instructor for nonmajors&lt;br&gt; Fee for nonmajors $100.00  Deposit: $100.00&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making.  We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)  Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HANDBUILT AND ALTERNATIVE CAMERAS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course will explore a wide range of handbuilt and low tech methods for generating photographic images. Students will learn to build pinhole cameras that range in size from match box to box trucks, learn about making cameras with 3-D printers, and become familiar with existing and modified low tech plastic cameras like the Diana, Holga, and others. Ultimately, whether a beautiful sculptural object that makes pictures, or a cardboard box held together with tape, students will make cameras that generate photographs which are clearly a product of the individual contraption which they have designed and designated a "camera." &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Junior and above&lt;br&gt; Prerequisite: PHOTO 5300, PHOTO W551, PHOTO 5302, PHOTO 5304, PHOTO 5350 or equivalent experience &lt;br&gt; Major Elective for Photo Majors&lt;br&gt;Non-Major Studio Elective for all other majors&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This class serves as an introduction to photographic methods and ideas. Through this, we will be exploring the creative possibilities of both traditional and digital photographic technologies. First and foremost, this course is about creative exploration in photography. Technical skills mean nothing if not paired with imagination, and this course will aim to develop both. Throughout the semester, the instructor will consistently be pushing towards an integration of these new technical skills with the interests and ideas that are important to you as an individual. Using film cameras and complimentary digital tools, students will address the essential technical, conceptual, and artistic problems that have been associated with photography since its birth, as well as some of the new issues that have arisen with the advent of digital imaging. Through a combination of assignments and critiques, in-class exercises, and artists' talks, students will question what they know about the medium and its potential. At a time when photography's popularity and ubiquity has challenged its relevance as a fine art form, this course will explore the photographic image as a powerful and versatile tool for contemporary artistic self-expression.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt; Deposit:$100&lt;/I&gt; &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Course fee and department receiving fee:$100.00 &lt;/i&gt; &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IMAGE BANK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Image Bank is an interdisciplinary course investigating how new personal, social and political meanings can be generated from disparate visual sources. Sifting through the sedimentary layers of our experience of visual images (from high to mundane), each student will create a personalized image bank of at least 250 examples, including snapshots, postcards, newspaper and magazine clippings, internet images and their own photographs. What once seemed series of casually accumulated images becomes something concrete and intentional. Students will each create personal "rules" for  their collecting, yet be challenged to explore how meanings change as they follow or bend those rules. Through collecting, indexing, and juxtaposing images, students will hone their skills as image interpreters and create new personal visual languages for themselves. In the end, each student will have a physical or digitized image bank to be used as source material for future projects. Throughout the course, we will explore artists whose work has focused on image collecting, including Gerhard Richter, Douglas Blau, Buzz Spector, John Cage, Martha Rossler, August Sander, Nina Katchadourian, John Baldessari, Hanne Darboven and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt; Fee for non-majors: $100.00&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>*FRANCE: PHOTOGRAPHY IN PARIS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Over a period of five weeks, students will come to know well the magnificent city of Paris with its abundant museums, significant architecture, atmospheric parks and intimate cafes.  Paris and its environs will be the catalyst for inspiring students of all levels of photography to begin or to continue to develop technical skills and to explore personal visions.&lt;BR&gt; In discussions on the work of past and contemporary photographers, in group critiques which investigate "learning how to see" and how to create "good" photographs, and in individual meetings, students are encouraged to respond in unique ways to photographic problems.&lt;BR&gt; Using black and white film and the 35mm camera as the primary tools for employing the visual language of art, students will process film and print in the well-appointed and maintained facility of the Photography Studies in France. The PSF building is located in the 11th arrondisement of Paris near the Bastille.  In addition, field trips outside the city will introduce students to the countryside, as well as afford further photographic opportunities. Independent study in photography in Paris is sure to impact on the creative life of a student at any level of photography in immeasurable ways!&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Estimated Travel Costs: This course has significant fees for travel and academic expenses which will be listed as soon as they are available.Payment in full is due at the time of registration.

   <COURSETITLE>INTRO TO DIGITAL PHOTOGRAPHY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>In this course, students will be introduced to the basic principles of digitally capturing, processing, and printing photographs that are really worth making.  We'll cover all the important functions that most digital cameras have in common and we'll go through the fundamentals of using Photoshop to refine and manipulate images. Students will learn their cameras' controls well enough to use the manual settings with confidence, and how to make the automatic features work for them instead of against them.  We?ll consider what makes a good photograph both technically and creatively, and we'll critique prints made on the Photo department's high-quality Epson printers.&lt;BR&gt;       Students will need to provide their own digital camera with raw capture capability (DSLR or equivalent), and a portable hard drive (formatted for Mac), both of which they should bring to the first class. (Hard drives will be needed before week 2.)  Students registered for the course who are in the market for a new camera are welcome to contact the professor for camera purchasing advice.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Open to Undergraduate and Graduate Students&lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>"The practice of taking pictures with a camera phone is so much more widespread than any other form of image-making in the history of humankind." - Mia Fineman, Associate Photography Curator at The Metropolitan Museum of Art, NY.&lt;BR&gt; Who is a photographer and who is the audience for photographic images today? How has the Internet changed conditions for taking, viewing, and sharing images? Increasingly, photographic images inhabit a virtual slipstream that dislodges pictures from both their object status and original author and context. The internet shifts, blurs, and multiplies the relationships between images.&lt;BR&gt; How are artists responding? In this class, you will engage in critical analysis of contemporary photographic practices in a networked age, and also define your own practice of collecting and organizing the images you upload to (or take from) the web.&lt;BR&gt; You will be developing different methodologies for presenting your "curated" collections including (but not limited to), book, tumblr, installation, YouTube, or blog formats. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Elective&lt;br&gt; Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>THE PHOTOBOOK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>It is not far fetched to think of our times as the Golden Age of the photobook. Never before have there been that many makers of photobooks, ranging from major publishers to individual artists producing their own photobooks "on demand." This development is both a reaction to and a consequence of new - digital - technologies, which have vastly lowered the barrier that stands between a photographer and her/his own photobook. As a consequence, there now is a small industry dedicated solely to photobooks, a development jump-started by the success of Martin Parr and Gerry Badger's two-volume The Photobook: A History. &lt;BR&gt; The purpose of this course is twofold. First, it introduce students to the photobook, its role and purpose, and its history. Part of the historical survey will be to study well-known or important photobooks to see how they operate. Readings will be given to explore, text, sequencing and concept. Students will use their on going studio work to complete assignments to establish photo book design and sequencing skills. Each student will complete a photobook for the class final project. There will be an assignment designed to help produce a digital proof but the final book will be hand printed and bound at a custom binder. Distribution of the photobook and self-publishing will be explored in depth.&lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;This is a laptop based class.  Laptop required&lt;br&gt; Elective, Sophomore and above&lt;br&gt; Fee for non-majors: $100.00 &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Students will be expected to work more autonomously and will explore their ideas with more focus and depth, with the goal of working toward the successful production of several bodies of work over the course of the year. Group and individual critiques will continue to form the basis of the course curriculum, supplemented by visiting critics, field trips and class exercises.

   <COURSEDESC>Installation Sight &amp; Sound is a studio course where students may create installations, performances, or site-specific works that incorporate screenprinting techniques as a primary medium. Students are encouraged to create experiences that transform the gallery setting or exist outside it. The course is open to students of every disciple and allows for cross-media experimentation. Print will be used and viewed as a drawing and sculptural tool that can be combined with your other technical/digital knowledge and experience. Students will be challenged to explore and invent new ways of utilizing Printmaking in their work, and will be encouraged to transform and reutilize space through interdisciplinary experimentation, and to begin to think about surfaces other than walls for the display of work. In the first half of the semester, students will conduct research, experiment with a variety of screenprinting techniques, offer short presentations of past work, and collaborate on midterm projects. In the second half of the semester, students will form final project proposals, and then work collaboratively or individually on a self-directed final. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as DM 4520 &lt;br&gt; Registration by Printmaking department; course is not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>WORKSHOP: LIGHT TO INK</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Contemporary Printmaking's use of photo print processes is ubiquitous. This class is about laying a foundation in making prints using those processes.  The class is designed to introduce students to the basics of Printmaking using either hand made, digital or photo-made matrixes. The class will learn to make prints using the traditional print methods of intaglio, lithography and screenprint and build a base of information about the production of the film transparencies from which the matrix is made. Students will be taught the skills necessary to take the photo, computer, or handmade image from a one or a series of positive transparencies to a finished print. "From Light to Ink" is a starting point for growth and exploration in photo printmaking and an introduction to printing in intaglio, lithography and screenprint. No prior knowledge of printmaking is required. This class is most appropriate for Sophomores, Juniors and 1st semester Seniors.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major requirement; Non-Majors by Permission of Instructor&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Registration by Printmaking department, course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Drawing is very often the backbone in service of some other artistic pursuit. In this course we will explore drawing as a means of expression all to itself. Our goal is to help students better realize their personal vision by strengthening their formal and thematic approach to drawing. We aim to achieve our goal by building confidence in mark making. We will begin by using observational drawing then branching off in different directions in order to produce the widest possible range of images.  Assignments that are designed to encourage experimentation with material and media will give way to more independently conceived projects as the course progresses.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

This should not only leave each person with an enthusiasm for the book form as art, but the ability and confidence to produce books on their own.  Assignments will be given each week with the objective of manifesting that week's demonstration and objectives into a realized binding. Each student will be required to produce a minimum of ten books. As weeks pass, we will slowly turn from teacher required bindings into student conceived bindings, ultimately culminating in a unique, wholly individual expression. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $175.00&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt; Major Elective; Elective for Non-Majors by Permission&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Printmakers as well as many other artists use paper as one of their main materials, yet have little opportunity to learn much about this material and its history, how it is made, and the materials that go into its production. In their sophomore year as print majors, RISD students study Japanese woodblock printing techniques in depth, a technology dependent on Japanese papers and their specific qualities. Other artists and designers habitually use fine quality Japanese washi for a wide variety of applications. This course will introduce RISD students not only to the traditions and history of Japanese paper and the corresponding tradition of printmaking, but also to paper fabrication through a two week workshop at a traditional paper manufacturer.&lt;BR&gt;  The class will then proceed to Kyoto for a three week stay to study in depth the historical sites and artistic collections of Kyoto, Nara and Osaka, with an overnight trip to study the art and architecture of the mountain monastery village of Koya San for an in depth appreciation of the continuing importance to Japanese art and culture.&lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt;Students who register for this class will also be registerd later by the Registrar for HAVC-H525 &lt;br&gt;Registration begins in October at a time to be announced. &lt;br&gt; Travel cost: $3,596.00 &lt;br&gt; ***Off-Campus Study*** &lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

The process will expand their options to work on large size and large scale prints on different grounds. The first structured projects will introduce strategies for designing a continuous pattern and the use of water-base pigments. Additional techniques will include flocking, use of metallic leaf and puff pigment to enhance the print. Individual directions in work will be encouraged.  At the end each student should have finished a series of prints that demonstrate creativity and competence in the application of the newly acquired techniques.  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Major Elective, Elective for Non-Majors by Permission &lt;/i&gt; </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will learn basic techniques of the monotype process. The course begin by covering basics of printmaking, how to prep paper, set up press, modify inks, and print a plate. Students will then spend the majority of the course focusing on how this process lends itself to the ability to layer colors and textures to create a complex image with a range of tones. Line work will also play an important role in the course with trace and dry point processes. For the final project students will utilize a range of techniques learned in a single image. This class is technical, however the imagery for each project will be your choice, so be ready to think about the uses of color in your imagery. Each project will be discussed individually at the start and presented in group critiques at the finish. &lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>In this course students will learn basic techniques of the monotype process. The course begin by covering basics of printmaking, how to prep paper, set up press, modify inks, and print a plate. Students will then spend the majority of the course focusing on how this process lends itself to the ability to layer colors and textures to create a complex image with a range of tones. Line work will also play an important role in the course with trace and dry point processes. For the final project students will utilize a range of techniques learned in a single image. This class is technical, however the imagery for each project will be your choice, so be ready to think about the uses of color in your imagery. Each project will be discussed individually at the start and presented in group critiques at the finish. &lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Interrogating Space: spaces imagined, spaces created, spaces walked upon. Inspired by Henri Lefebvre's concept of space as both "knowledge and action," this seminar considers space as theoretical concept and artistic material. Trespassing across a range of philosophical and critical texts, we consider space as a social and historical force, conceptual terrain, and as medium for artist interventions. Each class will focus on a specific theoretical project (Marxism) psychoanalysis, phenomenology, feminism, post-structuralism, postcolonial theory, visual culture, as examples) in conversation with artists' projects to interrogate how spaces are thought, produced and lived.&lt;BR&gt; Writings include: Walter Benjamin, Peter Sloterdijk, Henri Lefebvre, Paul Virilio, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, Michel Foucault, elizabeth Grosz, Sigmund Freud, Anthony Vidler, Michel de Certeau, Anne Wagner, Beatrice Colomina, Dan Graham, Liam Gillick, Edouard Glissant, Ralph Lemon, Okwui enwezor, Gayatri chakravorty spivak, Michael Warner.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate major elective; Sculpture majors only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>We will create a unique learning environment where a classroom space is dedicated solely to the making and the display of the course work for the duration of the semester. This approach will encourage the participants to generate work that cannot be "carted in and carted out for a critique". The opportunity creates a unique format for interacting and making work within RISD's academic and facility structure. The explorations in this course are based on the fact that absolutely everything is a material and that everything can be manipulated using conditional approaches, responses and skills.&lt;BR&gt;  We will start with fundamental skills that use; contextual influences, site specific analysis and behavioral observations. The emphasis will always be on making. You must be willing to adapt the way you work and collaborate with one another during the development and fabrication of every exploration. There will be occasions when you are used as material to be worked with. &lt;BR&gt; After a series of investigations and assignments, studio participants will generate work that is connected to their own interests. Together we will also create an environment within the room that supports the optimum display for all of the individual works. Everyone will be required to document their individual process and contribute to a final class compilation. This course supports the exploration and engagement of interdisciplinary and experiential learning.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Major Elective, Junior and Above&lt;br&gt; Open to non-majors by permission of department&lt;br&gt; Course not available via web registration&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We often respond and remember these uninhabitable experiences as though we had physically been there. Some existing formats include television programs,  theater performances, movies, the internet, historic recreations, store windows, miniaturization, dioramas, postcards, fantasy, cartoons etc.&lt;BR&gt; Artists and designers have benefitted from actively participating and manipulating where to locate the viewer as a part of the work they are making, keeping them at bay...from architects to cake bakers. (and it works) What happens when you address these issues directly and create works that are based on our acceptance of a physically limited engagement as being reality? Class participants will be encouraged to exploit this phenomena through class assignments, and their own interests and visual pursuits.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Elective&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>IRON IN WINTER</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Iron, as a material for sculpture, has a unique visual quality and history separate from Bronze and other traditional art metals. As one of the oldest and most common elements in the universe, it makes up the core of our planet and it runs through our veins. Artists respond to the transformation of Iron from elemental Earth to a liquid state fueled by fire; emerging as a new solid form, with an organic life that changes over time as it begins the slow return to its origin. We embrace the mechanical and architectural heritage of this material and its role in the Industrial Revolution; we marvel at its structure and strength, or its crystalline surface and depth, while adopting its history or reinventing its meaning within our own work.&lt;BR&gt;  In this course we will explore form, material and process as we use cast Iron as a material for sculpture. We will delve into the physics of the furnace, and the technical aspects of casting Iron using RISD's first homemade blast furnace. Students will receive hands on experience in this vigorous and physical process of preparing and running an Iron Cupola, reclaiming and smashing up radiators and bathtubs to give them new life as sculpture. The course will culminate in an Iron Pour of work created in class, then return to the studio to complete the projects.&lt;BR&gt;  This course requires prior experience with casting and will also involve hands on physical activity in the preparation for the pour.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Open to sophomore and above&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>CASTING STUDIO</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course is designed to build upon the fundamental principles of mold making and casting while exploring more complex concepts,  materials, and techniques. The transformative process of casting can embody the signs of growth or decay, of evolution and metamorphosis.  From cellular multiplicity to large scale sculptures, casting skills enable the artist to control the sensation of the finished work through a spectrum of materials and processes. &lt;BR&gt; Through demonstrations then hands-on exploration, students will pursue individual projects that reflect upon themes in sculpture that utilize casting for its unique versatility. Students will have extensive exposure to a variety of traditional and nontraditional materials. Processes will include multi-part shell molds, gypsum and composite materials for shell construction, urethane and silicone rubber, castable plastics, cold cast metals, and material specific release agents. We will review the possible health hazards associated with casting, and learn safe working methods, as well as have in-class discussions about concept and craft, various fabrication and finishing methods, and uses for molds in the making sculpture. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;This class is for junior sculpture majors and other students with  permission of the instructor. Elective; Sculpture majors must choose this class or SCULP 4691 during junior year.&lt;BR&gt; Registration by Sculpture department, course not available via web registration&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

We trespass from sculpture to science fiction, cinema to landscape, punk rock to theory, dance to poetics, sound to insomnia, history to holodeck. These encounters-conceptual and material-engage a constellation of ideas surrounding critical writing and art-making processes. &lt;BR&gt;  To think, to construct, to write within such a surround invites a precarious approach to process and to concept untethering syntax (materially, linguistically, theoretically) from its rational grounds.

   <COURSEDESC>Our eyes are nearly always drawn towards something moving over something inert. What innovative strategies can be employed to incorporate video, sculpture, and physical space into a single work, without one medium dominating the other? How can an artist resolve the fundamental differences between two-dimensional moving images and three-dimensional objects or space? This intensive studio elective will explore methods and issues of assimilating video, photography, sound, performance, objects, and space through studying and constructing multimedia sculpture and installations. Throughout the semester we will be presented with assignments that examine these different possibilities from multiple perspectives, including studio projects that deploy video in a sculptural context, and sculpture that is only activated through a video work. We will study the recent history of artists and designers who engage multimedia techniques and experiment with new formats and technologies. Students will learn the basics of DSLR camera technique, digital video editing, audio production, audio/video display technology, and installation techniques. Students in the course should have an understanding of sculptural materials and fabrication techniques, and should be ready to experiment with the fundamental structure of the presentation of media. &lt;BR&gt; Estimated Material Cost: $150.00 &lt;br&gt; &lt;I&gt; Sophomore and above &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

Morden steel-working processes allow for a variety of practices to attain an almost unlimited range of shapes and forms from this simple material. The versatility, to expand and challenge the modern vocabulary of steel practice by incorporating ideas, techniques and materials from students' major interests. You should be prepared to work hard in an art-industrial shop setting, not with the aim of laying the perfect bead for industrial pipe-fitting, but rather to diversity and develop your own personal practice through exposure to steel-working techniques. &lt;br&gt;  Estimated Material Costs: $200.00 </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>Using our understanding of how artists relate the the natural world, this calls will use sculpture as a vehicle to express our ideas around what nature is, where it exists and how we use it. &lt;br&gt; Making work inspired by nature doesn't always mean that one must use natural or recycled materials. In this class we are interested in exploring both the beautiful and the grotesque. Nature goes beyond romantic landscpaes of prstine natural beauty. It includes urban settings and their distinct ecosystems of undesirable yet resilient flora and fauna such as rats, pigeons and the weeds that group up from cracks in the sidewalk. &lt;br&gt;  How can we reconcile the multi-faceted world we live in? A world where we chose to save one species and flinch at the sight of another? How can we use materials, both natural and synthetic, to address our personal concepts surrounding human interaction with nature? &lt;br&gt; Through a combination of readings, lectures and studio assignments, we will explore how our idea of nature is ever changing and how we can push the boundaries of sculpture as object. &lt;br&gt; From the 1960's to today, we will be looking at different artists to broaden our understanding of what we call sculpture and the different approaches artists have used to explore nature. &lt;br&gt; Short assignments will allow freedom to explore prompts, challenge concepts and experiment with materials, leading into a final project. </COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>HISTORY OF WESTERN TEXTILES: FOCUS ON EUROPE AND AMERICA</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>From Coptic fragments to 15th-century Italian trade silks, early 20th-century apparel fabrics to mid-century modern casement cloths, this course will utilize the extensive textile and apparel collections of the RISD Museum of Art as points of departure for the study of Western textile design. By way of illustrated lecture (both in the classroom and at the Museum), discussions and readings, students will come to understand the stylistic and cultural significance textiles have played in the history of Western art and culture from antiquity to the modern era. The manner in which social, economic, technological, and political changes have impacted advancements in textile fibers, fabric structures, color, and design will be explored. Research projects utilizing the textile and apparel collections will afford students the opportunity to partake in hands-on objects based study.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>KNITTED FABRICS</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This course approaches the development of machine knit fabrics and forms as one process, where aspects of form are developed along-side fabric patterns and structures. Continuing from the introductory course, Knitting Machine Techniques, students learn advanced construction techniques and knit structure drafting and shaping, in order to further develop their design processes and ideas for knits. Emphasis is placed on experimentation, careful consideration of materials, and research, as ideas about color, pattern, texture, drape, and concept, and working large scale are explored. Fully-fashioned garments are the primary three-dimensional forms to which students apply their ideas, in the form of two major projects. Through the semester, students bring their experience of garment building and shaping, their range of knitting skills and techniques, and their ability to express ideas in knitting to a higher level of resolution. Hand knitting, embellishment, dyeing, printing, finishing, felting and other processes are encouraged and can be integrated into the fabric design and construction.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major elective; Textile majors only; Junior only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DIGITAL EMBROIDERY</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Digital embroidery transforms hand-crafted couture into a work of fine art. Just like a tattoo where an image is created with needles and color, so embroidered fabric or paper is needle-stitched with colored threads. A basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop is helpful, but we will also cover the fundamentals of creating a preparatory design file in Adobe Illustrator. This vector design file will then be artistically translated into a Pulse embroidery file that can be saved and sewn out as as a multiple or repeat pattern. The resulting personalized textile can be applied to fabrics for apparel or interior applications as well as fine art. &lt;BR&gt;  There will be a series of small assignments to build up a repertoire of techniques and then a final project that summarizes the student's ability and artistic innovation. This course will explore top of the line Tajima Pulse software with the goal of creating personal creative images that will be sewn out on a 15-needle Tajima commercial embroidery machine.&lt;BR&gt;</COURSEDESC>

In the process of applying the technique to modern art, the challenge comes from seeing things around us in new ways: to see things with the mind; to approach problem-solving with a risk-taking attitude toward the unknown and unfamiliar; and thus gain an increasing ability to visualize invisible concepts into sketches and works of art.  Throughout the session, students will sharpen the eye and mind, and together with skillful hands, will become proactive toward art-making and ultimately life itself.&lt;br&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>The student's project, designed in consultation with the faculty, can be in one of the textile areas or in combination with other areas of the school.  The project, which will be evaluated by the faculty and visiting critics at the end of the semester, can entail a collection of designs or fine arts work representing the current conclusive state of students' work or an investigation of a new area.  If the project involves such a new investigation, the final presentation will consist of a review of the investigatory process.  The level of concepts, skills, and commitment constitute a major part of the criteria in the evaluation of the work.&lt;BR&gt;  &lt;I&gt;Restricted to Senior Textile Majors&lt;BR&gt; Schedule individually arranged by instructor&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course explores the development of a conceptual framework for studio-based teaching and learning for children and adolescents. The course introduces an approach to pedagogy for art and design that is informed by artistic practice and which revolves around meaning-making. Students examine the principles of curriculum mapping and instructional design through the development of a series of units of instruction based respectively on themes, subjects, and media - all of which are crafted to meet the cognitive, social, and personal interests of children and youth. The course explores the relationship between curriculum, instruction, and assessment and where curriculum and instruction is focused on deepening K-12 students' understandings of art and design as expressions of enduring ideas. In explorations of assessment, students consider and design various formative and summative strategies to capture and evaluate levels of student understanding. Throughout this course, there is an emphasis on the development of curriculum design and instructional strategies for elementary and secondary students that encourage discovery, creativity, innovation, personal voice, and even play!&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirement for MAT,MA (Community Arts Education); MAT &amp; MA only &lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>LAB SCHOOL: LEARNING THROUGH ART AND DESIGN</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>This field-based class provides graduate students with an opportunity to experience and examine the dynamics of teaching and learning within an elementary school setting - particularly, Providence's Highlander Charter School. The course is predominantly concerned with the development of teaching and learning strategies with which to incorporate art and design into general education while at the same time maintaining both disciplines' integrity. There is a special emphasis on utilizing art and design to support any school's literacy initiative. The course is constructed with two complementary elements - a participatory component in which pairs of graduate students work collaboratively with a non-art specialist or general classroom teacher. Graduate students have the opportunity to lead small groups of children in formal teaching and learning experiences and to use these opportunities to reflect on matters of content, student understanding, and the effectiveness of communication.  The second component of the course is a seminar that uses the graduate students' authentic classroom experiences as an opportunity to examine a broad range of educational issues that include: the impact of teaching and learning environments, the diversity of learners, arts integration, culturally responsive teaching, technology in the classroom, and classroom management.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirementfor MAT; MAT only&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>COLLEGIATE STUDIO: LEARNING CENTERED LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Using RISD as a site for the exploration of strategies for studio-based teaching and learning is the goal of the course. It is designed for students who will be teaching during the course of study at RISD or who plan to teach after graduation. The course draws upon the varying expertise and teaching methodologies of RISD faculty and visiting faculty from other institutions to provide graduate students with models of practice. Learning to teach in a generative and attentive manner can bring teaching closer to one's studio practice. The course is composed of readings, reviews, discussion, project assignments, lectures, and peer presentations. The final outcome will be formation of a condensed teaching portfolio including a teaching philosophy, course proposals, a detailed syllabus, sample class assignments and assessment guides.&lt;br&gt; This course may also be taken in any sequence with Collegiate Teaching: Preparation &amp; Reflection.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Graduate elective&lt;br&gt; Also offered as GRAD 055G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DRAWING OBJECTIVES: A GUIDED DRAWING SEMINAR</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>Drawing has been called the distillation of an idea. Drawing sensibilities pervade all visual media yet drawing can be independent of all other media. Can we make our drawing ventures have resonance? The goal is to understand drawing in a multivalent way through paced experiences and investigations via short research projects, three generative series and development of a sited-drawing plan. Methods will include teamed technical presentations of expertise or interest as well as examples of ancient and historical means of silverpoint, transfer drawings, panoramas and dioramas. Drawing epochs represented in the RISD Museum of Art, collection will be examined (through works by artists such as Wilfredo Lam, Gego, or the Rimpa period Korin Gafu.)  Focused critiques, readings and guided and self-directed independent studio production are components.&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major graduate requirement for MA (community arts education); Elective for all other graduate students &lt;br&gt; Also offered as GRAD 658G&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSEDESC>This course provides students from any major with the opportunity to explore the field of teaching as a possible career option beyond graduation. The course involves completing an internship with an art teacher two days a week in either public or private schools. Students enrolled in this course will hopefully, be able to translate some of their excitement for art and design to the school setting, and in doing so, become a valuable resource to both the art teacher and his/her students.  Students taking this course are also required to attend and participate in a weekly seminar to discuss their experiences and to further explore a variety of issues related to teaching art and design at the K-12 level. Selected readings, a directed reflective journal, presentations, and a leave-behind contribution to the assigned school are among the assignments for this course.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;I&gt;Open to Undergraduates only.&lt;/I&gt;</COURSEDESC>

   <COURSETITLE>DESIGN EDUCATION STUDIO WORKSHOP: PLACE BASED LEARNING</COURSETITLE>
   <COURSEDESC>The urban landscape is comprised of designed elements at multiple scales, ranging from a city's infrastructure to the architectural details of street furniture and building fagades. Although people are more and more likely to inhabit urban places, whether a small town or large metropolis, it is rare that we look carefully at the details and making of a place in such a way that we truly know the "genius loci" or spirit of the place. The unique meeting of the geographic underpinnings of a place, its natural resources and amenities that made it a likely place for settlement and the layers of design undertakings over time that build the structure of a city are critical to place-making. Knowing and understanding the environment is a critical piece of design education that can take many forms and be addressed through projects at many scales.&lt;BR&gt;  This course is designed to build your vocabulary for understanding the design of place and then provide opportunities to use your skills as teachers of art + design to translate that vocabulary into projects that can open up the designed world to young people. We will look at design of place and urban space from three vantage points relating to children: PLACES FOR CHILDREN; PLACES AND CHILDREN; and PLACES BY CHILDREN. To address these issues, we will conduct a series of design exercises exploring the urban environment working with scale, perspective, and mapping elements of the city's built and natural environment. In addition, we will look at the local and global role of sustainable design in the fields of architecture and urbanism and work to develop ways to present these integrated design challenges to young people.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;i&gt;Major Graduate requirement for MAT; Open to other Grads by permission of instructor&lt;/i&gt;</COURSEDESC>
